# Employee Transfer, Relieving and Joining Workflow — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS05, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Module code:** PS05 (alias PS-M05; supersedes the `M05-TRJ` code from `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` — see `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §B)
**Program:** PrimeSoft HRMS — public-sector configuration & extension of the **PrimeSoft HRMS platform**
**Document version:** v3.0 (platform-re-grounded — re-anchors v2.0 onto the existing PrimeSoft platform engines P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3 and RBAC v1.7)
**Supersedes:** v2.0 (`docs/brd/v2/M05-transfer-relieving-joining-workflow.md`), which itself superseded v1.0
**Relationship (per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A row PS05):** **NET-NEW (enterprise-specific)** — PrimeSoft has no transfer/posting module; the closest commercial concept (internal mobility) is an Org-Admin report, not a transfer engine. PS05 authors transfer-order, relieving-at-source and joining-at-destination as **configured P01 flows + net-new statutory entities** (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §D), runs on **P01 (workflow), P05 (audit), P06 (migration)**, and **emits SR events to the PS12 SR ledger**.
**Grounded in:** Master BRD v2.1 · Product Vision v2.6 · Platform Specification v1.6 · RBAC Design v1.7 · Foundation FS v1.6 · `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` · `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md`.
**Status:** Baseline for build (parallel-agent ready; platform-grounded contracts frozen).
**Owns (net-new enterprise entities, §D):** Transfer lifecycle entities (requests, orders, clearances, charge handovers, joining reports, deputations, drives, preferences, transfer policy rules) **plus** SR outbox, representations/stay-orders, counselling sessions, quarter/estate retention, gapless order-number sequences, order acknowledgements, and drive-scoped vacancy reservations. Each carries `tenant_id`/`entity_id` and runs on the named platform services.
**Consumes (platform services & enterprise platform-modules — references by id, never re-authors):** **P01** WorkflowEngine (`workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`), **P02** Authorization.check + RBAC v1.7, **P04** tenant/org-admin + `org_units` model, **P05** dual audit log (`audit_log`/`security_audit_log`), **P06** migration toolkit, **X.1** background-jobs runner, **X.2** notification infrastructure, **X.3** integration framework, **W.1/W.2/W.3** configured flows/forms/notification config; **PS01** Employee Profile/Master (employee + org placement), **PS06** Promotion/Seniority (strength & seniority read-through, joining-sequence consumer), **PS09** Disciplinary (abandonment trigger), **PS10** Payroll & Benefits (pay-continuity/entitlement/LPC/licence-fee signals), **PS12** Digital SR ledger (SR event writer on the P05 substrate), **PS13** Document Management (order/clearance PDFs + statutory document classes), **PS14** Dashboard & Analytics; and the platform **Holiday & Region master** (Org Admin Master Data) for the regional working-day calendar.

## Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform

> Required by `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §9 rule 6. Maps every PS05 FR to the platform service(s) it runs on and flags the `GAP (enterprise-specific)` logic PS05 authors. **No FR re-implements a platform engine** — transfer/relieving/joining business logic is authored; workflow, RBAC, audit, notification, jobs, migration and configured-content plumbing is consumed.

| FR | Runs on platform service(s) | PS05-authored (`GAP (enterprise-specific)`) | SR / external signal target |

**Net-new statutory surface PS05 authors (per `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §1.2 / §9):** the transfer/relieving/joining orders engine. It still **runs on P01 (workflow), P05 (audit) and P06 (migration)** and consumes the validation library, RBAC model and notification infrastructure. The **PS12 SR ledger is the statutory system-of-record** — PS05 is a **writer** to it, never an owner of a shared platform SR table (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C/§D).

## Amendments (v2 → v3: platform re-grounding)

> This table records every change made to re-anchor v2.0 onto the real PrimeSoft platform. **All v2 functional content, entities, invariants, state machines, acceptance tests and the domain primer are preserved**; only the platform plumbing, ids, codes, roles and NFR baselines are re-grounded. Each row cites the governing override in `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C or `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`.

## Amendments (v3 → v3.1: cross-module remediation)

> Records the surgical cross-module convergence fixes applied per `docs/review/REMEDIATION.md` (D1, D5; R1 findings F-01..F-04, F-10, F-11). **PS12 froze the SR ingestion contract**; PS05 is a writer and now conforms to the canonical write-port, event taxonomy, ingest payload contract, reversal envelope, and shared-entity naming. No functional content changed; only the SR boundary and naming were re-grounded.

| # | Decision | v3.0 (pre-remediation) | v3.1 (remediated) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **SR write-port** (D1) | Posted to `POST /api/v1/sr/events` | Canonical **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (+ **`/api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal`**); module-local `sr_outbox`/reconciliation paths are façades that **relay to `/sr/ingest`** — no direct SR-table INSERT, no `/sr/events` | REMEDIATION D1; PS12 FR-01/02 |
| R2 | **Event-type codes** (D1, F-01/F-02) | Free-form `TRANSFER_ORDERED`, `RELIEVED`, `JOINED`, `COMPENSATING` | Exact PS12-published codes: **`TRANSFER`, `RELIEVING`, `JOINING`, `MUTUAL_TRANSFER`, `TRANSFER_CANCELLED`, `RELIEVING_CANCELLED`, `JOINING_CANCELLED`** (cited verbatim) | REMEDIATION D1; PS12 catalog |
| R3 | **Ingest payload contract** (D1, F-03) | Only `idempotency_key` formula + outbox row scoping | Dedup tuple **`(source_module="PS05", source_reference_id, source_event_version)`** + required **`fact_key`** (qualifying-service) + explicit **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`** on the SR payload (not just the outbox row) | REMEDIATION D1; PS12 FR-01 |
| R4 | **Reversal/correction** (D1, F-04) | Invented `COMPENSATING` event type | Removed. PS12 envelope **`is_reversal=true`+`reverses_source_reference_id`** with the published `*_CANCELLED` partner types; **supersede-not-delete** (PS12 auto-spawns the corrigendum) | REMEDIATION D1 |
| R5 | **Shared-entity naming** (D5, F-10/F-11) | Singular `org_unit` (entity/model/FK references) | Standardised to **`org_units`** (plural) throughout entity/model/FK references; FK column names (`source_org_unit_id` etc.) unchanged | REMEDIATION D5 |

Affected sections: §Alignment map (FR-004/008/010/013 SR targets), §5.2.15 `sr_outbox` (`event_type` ENUM + payload + idempotency contract), §5.2 FK references, FR-PS05-012 (SR posting), FR-PS05-013 (amend/cancel/revoke), §8.4 JSON example, §10 state machine, §13 migration, §14.1 traceability, §16.2 narrative.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Employee Transfer, Relieving and Joining Workflow module (**PS05**) digitises the **end-to-end employee mobility lifecycle** of a enterprise/public-sector organisation: from the **initiation of a transfer** (by request, administrative decision, mutual exchange, deputation, or promotion-linkage), through **transfer-order generation, statutory approval, and proof-of-service to the employee**, **relieving at the source office** (departmental no-dues/clearance, handover of charge, last-working-day, relieving order), the **transfer-in-transit / joining-time period treated as continuous paid service**, and finally **joining at the destination office** (joining report, charge assumption, confirmation of joining date, inter-se seniority sequencing). Every materially significant event is posted as a statutory **Service Register (SR) event** to the **PS12 Digital SR ledger** (on the P05 audit substrate), and the relieving/joining events explicitly **assert no break in qualifying service**.

The module replaces a paper-driven, multi-office, hand-carried "Last Pay Certificate + relieving letter + joining report" process that today causes pay gaps, disputed seniority dates, lost no-dues forms, and unauditable transit periods. It establishes a **single auditable system of record** for who is posted where, from when, under what order, in whose custody during transit, and with what dues outstanding — **running on the PrimeSoft platform engines** rather than a parallel stack.

### 1.2 Business context (public-sector statutory)
Transfers in enterprise are **regulated administrative actions**. They are constrained by transfer policy (minimum tenure at a post, transfer ban/freeze periods such as election model-code-of-conduct windows, protected categories such as spouse-posting, medical grounds, single-parent, differently-abled, near-retirement protection), by **vacancy and sanctioned-strength** discipline (the authoritative source of which is **PS06/PS01**, **read-through** by PS05, not duplicated), and by **due process** (competent/appointing authority sanction enforced by **P01** with SoD by **P02**, proof of service on the employee, transfer counselling for cadre drives). Relieving and joining have **pay and seniority consequences**: the date of relieving and date of joining define the **transit period**, which is **paid joining time / duty** (not dead time), and which fixes joining-time admissibility, pay continuity, and the **seniority/service continuity** recorded in the **PS12 Digital SR**. Transfers are routinely contested through representations and court/tribunal **stay orders**, and may end in **non-joining/abandonment**; all of these are first-class, modelled states. Errors are statutorily and financially material.

### 1.3 Scope summary
In scope: transfer request/initiation across all transfer types; eligibility & policy enforcement; counselling/preference capture **including interactive counselling sessions**; vacancy-driven and bulk transfer drives with an explicit vacancy lifecycle; transfer-order generation with **gapless statutory numbering**, approval (P01), **proof-of-service & acknowledgement**, amendment, cancellation and revocation; **representation / stay-order / retention holds**; relieving (no-dues clearance **as a P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` flow with SLA-bounded escalation and deemed clearance**, charge handover **with handover-under-protest**, relieving order **with deemed-relief Authority power**, last working day); **service-continuity and in-transit custody management**; joining (joining report, charge assumption, **inter-se seniority sequencing**, **non-joining/abandonment resolution**); deputation & repatriation; **enterprise quarters/estate retention & licence-fee recovery**; SR-event posting to PS12 via a fully-specified transactional outbox on X.1; module notifications (X.2/W.3), reporting and analytics (PS14).

Out of scope (owned elsewhere, integrated): the canonical employee master & org placement (**PS01**), promotion decisioning and seniority computation (**PS06** — PS05 consumes promotion-linked transfer triggers, reads sanctioned strength/seniority, and writes posting changes + joining-sequence facts), payroll Last Pay Certificate generation, **joining-time pay / transfer entitlement computation**, pay disbursement and licence-fee recovery (**PS10** — PS05 raises the LPC trigger, the **pay-continuity + entitlement** signal, and the licence-fee-recovery signal), pension/retirement (PS11), the **PS12 Digital SR ledger** itself (PS05 is a writer), disciplinary proceedings for abandonment (**PS09** — PS05 raises the trigger), and the document object store (**PS13** — PS05 stores order/clearance PDFs there, with a statutory sensitive-category class for medical/spouse/compassionate evidence). Workflow, RBAC, audit, notifications, jobs, migration and configured content are **platform services (P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3)** consumed by id.

### 1.4 Primary outcomes & KPIs
| Outcome | KPI | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Faster relieving | Median time order-served → relieved | ≤ 5 working days |
| **No pay gaps** | % transfers with continuous pay (no break) via service-continuity model | ≥ 99% |
| Auditable transit | % transfers with recorded relieving + joining dates **and a defined in-transit custodian** | 100% |
| Policy compliance | % orders violating ban/tenure rules at issue **without a recorded Authority override** | 0% (hard-blocked) |
| Clearance discipline | % relievings with all mandatory no-dues closed (cleared, with-dues, waived, or **deemed-cleared with audit**) | 100% |
| SR integrity | % transfer/relieving/joining events posted to **PS12** | 100% |
| Custody integrity | % in-transit employees with exactly one custodian office (no dual/zero posting) | 100% |
| Service-of-order integrity | % orders with recorded served-on date before relieve-by enforcement | 100% |
| Self-service adoption | % transfer requests raised via self-service (Me workspace) | ≥ 70% |

### 1.5 Key stakeholders
Employees (transferees), Reporting Managers, HR Officers/Admins at source and destination offices, Department Heads / Appointing & Transfer Authorities, Clearance Officers (IT, Library, Accounts, Stores, Advances, Quarters/Estate), Estate/Quarters Officer, SR Custodian/Registrar (PS12), Payroll Officer (PS10 Payroll Admin), Disciplinary Authority (PS09), Auditors (Org-Admin read), and System Administrators (Org/Platform Admin).

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (platform behaviours consumed, applied in this module)
- **Maker-checker workflow** via **P01 WorkflowEngine** for every order, relieving, and joining action — configured as **W.1 flow definitions**, not coded; double-clicked/retried approves produce one `workflow_actions` row (engine idempotency).
- **Segregation of duties** enforced by **P01/P02** (deny-by-default, multi-role intersection, no self-approval): initiator ≠ approver; transferee may never approve own transfer or self-clear a no-dues item; clearance officer ≠ transferee; relinquisher ≠ acceptor; the Authority granting a forced action is recorded and may not be the transferee.
- **Single state authority:** all `transfer_orders.status` transitions are mediated by one **`TransferOrderStateService`** (§16.6) which **calls P01 for gating and P05 for audit**; no other component writes the column.
- **Row-level scoping** by `org_units` (P02 data-scope filter, one of the five RBAC scoping dimensions): source-office HR sees relieving; destination-office HR sees joining; a transferee in transit is visible to both and owned by the **in-transit custodian** (FR-PS05-015).
- **Immutable audit** via **P05** (DB-trigger capture on every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE; `audit_log` for data, `security_audit_log` for auth/RBAC); **forced actions, overrides, deemed-clearances, and sensitive-document access carry a dedicated audit reason + actor** in the mutated row, captured by the trigger.
- **Soft delete** (`is_deleted`) on transactional entities except append-only ledgers/outbox/choice logs (no hard delete — Platform §8.2).
- **Document binding:** every generated order and signed clearance/handover/joining artefact is stored in **PS13** and referenced by ID; medical/spouse/compassionate evidence uses a **statutory sensitive document class** with restricted access + access logging (P05).
- **i18n / locale:** dates `DD-MMM-YYYY` display; UTC storage; INR money; bilingual order templates (W.2 i18n).
- **Pagination:** all list endpoints **cursor only** (`limit` default 25, max 100, `next_cursor`).
- **Idempotency:** workflow-initiating / external-signal POSTs accept an `Idempotency-Key` (24h replay window).

### 2.3 In-scope / Out-of-scope boundary table
| Concern | In PS05 | Owned by |
|---|---|---|
| Transfer order data & lifecycle (incl. gapless numbering, proof-of-service) | ✅ | PS05 |
| No-dues / clearance (P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`, SLA escalation, deemed clearance) | ✅ | PS05 (flow on P01) |
| Charge handover/assumption (incl. under-protest) | ✅ | PS05 |
| Joining report + inter-se joining sequence | ✅ | PS05 |
| In-transit custody assignment | ✅ | PS05 |
| Representation / stay-order / retention holds | ✅ | PS05 |
| Quarters/estate retention record + vacation timeline | ✅ | PS05 |
| Deputation/repatriation records | ✅ | PS05 |
| SR outbox & idempotency | ✅ | PS05 (runs on X.1/X.3) |
| Employee master fields, **org placement / `org_units`** | Updated by PS05 on join (via PS01 service) | **PS01** (owner) |
| Promotion decision, seniority math, **sanctioned strength** | Consumes/reads | **PS06** |
| LPC, **joining-time pay & transfer entitlement computation**, pay-continuity execution, dues/licence-fee recovery | Raises signals | **PS10** |
| Disciplinary proceedings for abandonment | Raises trigger | **PS09** |
| **SR ledger entries** | Writes events | **PS12** (on P05 substrate) |
| Order/clearance PDFs storage + sensitive document class | References | **PS13** |
| Working-day / regional holiday calendar | Reads | **Platform Holiday & Region master** (Org Admin Master Data) |
| Workflow / RBAC / audit / notifications / jobs / migration / configured content | Consumes by id | **P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3** |

### 2.4 Assumptions & constraints
- **Sanctioned strength / vacancy data is owned by PS06/PS01 and read-through by PS05**; PS05 stores only **drive-scoped reservation** state (`vacancy_reservations`). If the strength read is unavailable, vacancy-driven flows degrade to manual destination entry with a warning (no hard block) and a reconciliation flag — surfaced via X.3 error mapping, not a 503.
- Transfer policy parameters (tenure thresholds, ban calendars, protected categories, clearance SLAs, joining-time distance bands) are **configurable master data** (versioned config cascade platform→tenant→entity→employee per Platform §0.3) maintained by System Administrators (Org Admin) and Transfer Authorities; the module ships seeded defaults.
- A transfer always has exactly one source `org_units` and one destination `org_units` (deputation destination may be an external organisation modelled as an `org_units` of type `EXTERNAL` in the platform org model).
- "Office" = an `org_units` of a transferable type; clearance departments are configured per office, and an office may legitimately have **fewer than the seven default departments** (only configured departments generate clearance branches in the `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` flow).
- A **successor may not exist**; charge may be handed to a link officer, the office (custody-of-office), or held under protest (FR-PS05-007/016).
- The **transit period is paid duty/leave**, not unpaid; pay is continuous with a custody handoff (FR-PS05-015).
- A regional **working-day/holiday calendar** exists in the platform **Holiday & Region master**; PS05 does not silently assume Sat/Sun + national holidays (§8.3, FR-PS05-009).
- Every PS05 table carries **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`** and relies on **data-layer scoping** (Platform §0.1); a query without a resolvable tenant scope is rejected.

## 3. Roles & Permissions

> Per `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6: the access-control **model** is owned by **RBAC v1.7**. Enterprise statutory actors are expressed as **new roles + capability flags ADDED** to the taxonomy (registered in RBAC §2.2/§4.3 via the working-group process), never a parallel scheme. **SoD (maker ≠ checker, no self-approval) is enforced by P01/P02**, not re-implemented here.

### 3.1 Module roles (RBAC v1.7 additions / mappings)
| PS05 actor | Express in RBAC v1.7 as | Module responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee (Transferee)** | existing **Employee** (RBAC §2.4), own-record scope | Raise transfer-on-request / mutual request; submit preferences; **acknowledge order service**; submit joining report; view own transfer status & orders (Me workspace). |
| **Reporting Manager** | existing **Manager L1** (RBAC §2.3), manager scope + has-reportees | Recommend/endorse request; confirm charge handover acceptance where receiving charge (My Team workspace). |
| **HR Officer (Source / Destination)** | existing **HRBP / Office Admin** (RBAC §2.2), entity + `org_units` scope | Source: drive clearance, issue relieving order, record LWD, raise LPC/pay-continuity, record **served-on date**. Destination: receive transferee, validate joining report, confirm joining date, assign **joining sequence**, resume pay-continuity. |
| **HR Admin** | existing **HR Administrator** (RBAC §2.2, superset operational role) | Initiate admin/bulk transfers, configure office clearance departments, manage drives & counselling sessions. |
| **Transfer Authority / Appointing Authority** | **NEW role `transfer_authority`** (sanctioning authority; P01 approver; **MFA enforced**) | Approve/sanction transfer orders; approve amendments, cancellations, revocations; approve deputation & repatriation; **exercise forced-action powers** (deemed-clearance, handover-under-protest, deemed-relief); decide representations/stay-holds; override policy. |
| **Clearance Officer (per department: IT, Library, Accounts, Stores, Advances, Estate/Quarters)** | **NEW capability flag `ps05_clearance_officer`** on an entity-scoped role, scoped per department `org_units` | Grant/deny no-dues for their department branch; record outstanding dues. |
| **Estate / Quarters Officer** | **NEW capability flag `ps05_estate_officer`** | Record official-accommodation retention, vacation-by dates, raise licence-fee-recovery signal. |
| **Charge Receiving Officer** | **runtime-resolved approver** (P01 named-individual / successor mechanism) | Accept handover of charge/assets at source; certify assumption at destination. |
| **SR Custodian / Registrar** | **NEW entity-scoped role + capability flag on the PS12 SR ledger** (mirrors the Document Admin pattern; runs on P05 substrate, per `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6) | Confirm SR event postings; reconcile SR/outbox discrepancies. |
| **Payroll Officer** | **map to existing Payroll Admin** (RBAC §2.2; PS10) | Acknowledge pay-continuity, entitlement, LPC & licence-fee-recovery signals. |
| **Disciplinary Authority** | **NEW role** (RBAC §6.6; PS09) | Receive abandonment trigger. |
| **Auditor** | **map to Org-Admin read + read-only individual entitlement** (RBAC §3.2; P05 query access) — **no parallel write role** | Read-only access to all transfer records, holds, forced-action audit, and the P05 audit log. |
| **System Administrator** | **map to Org Admin / Platform Super Admin** (RBAC §2.1) | Configure policy rules, ban calendars, order templates (W.2), clearance department catalog, SLA & distance bands, number-sequence policy; no transactional self-approval. |
| **Presiding Officer (counselling)** | `transfer_authority` role or `ps05_presiding_officer` capability flag | Run interactive counselling session; record observed choices. |

All new roles/flags are **registered in RBAC §2.2/§4.3** with grant authority and audit logging to **P05** (`security_audit_log`, `event_type=RBAC_CHANGE`).

### 3.2 Permission matrix (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, A=Approve, X=Execute action, — =none)
> Enforced by **P02 `Authorization.check`** (deny-by-default → role grant → multi-role intersection → entitlement → capability flag → PII ceiling → data-scope filter → field mask on serialization). Endpoints never re-implement this logic.

| Capability | Employee | Rep. Mgr | HR Src | HR Dest | HR Admin | Transfer Auth | Clearance Off | Estate Off | Charge Recv | SR Custodian | Payroll Off | Auditor | Sys Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Raise transfer request | C (own) | C (team) | C | C | C | — | — | — | — | — | — | R | — |

| View analytics dashboard | R (own) | R (team) | R | R | R | R | R (own dept) | R (estate) | — | R | R | R | R |

All approvals enforce **maker ≠ checker** and **transferee-exclusion** via **P01/P02**. Forced actions, overrides, and sensitive-document access additionally require a recorded justification, captured in the mutated row and surfaced by the **P05** trigger in the audit trail and in PS14 analytics. PII (enterprise identifiers, financial fields) is masked on serialization per the **PII Protection Ceiling**.

### 3.3 Workspace & UI-state model
Per Platform §6.5, surfaces are organised by the **Workspace switcher** (Me / My Team / Admin, derived from RBAC role holdings + has-reportees). Employee transfer self-service lives in **Me**; manager endorsement and team relieving/joining in **My Team**; HR Admin / Authority configuration and drive management in **Admin** (exclusive). Approval, clearance and forced-action surfaces use the shared **approval action bar** (approve / reject / send-back / delegate, labels per W.1 stage aliases) and the five canonical UI states (Foundation §3).

## 4. Platform Foundation (consumed, not restated)

This module **consumes** the PrimeSoft platform contracts by id and does not restate them (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`):

- **P01 WorkflowEngine** — all approval/maker-checker flows; **clearance = `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`**; SLA runtime for per-stage SLA + escalation; in-flight version pinning; `workflow_actions`.
- **P02 Authorization.check + RBAC v1.7** — per-request authz, scoping, field masking, PII ceiling, capability flags; SoD.
- **P04 Tenant & Org Admin** — tenant/entity model, **`org_units`** org placement, `integration_credentials` for PS12/PS10 portal integrations.
- **P05 Audit & Compliance** — dual log, DB-trigger capture, immutable, 7-yr; the **substrate the PS12 SR ledger runs on**; tamper-evidence tracks OPEN-PLAT-03.
- **P06 Migration Toolkit** — ETL+V, 3 dry runs, waves, `migration_runs`, `ps05_source_id` traceability.
- **X.1 Background Jobs runner** — hosts `JOB-PS05-*` (index in Foundation §4).
- **X.2 Notification Infrastructure** + **W.3** config — `IN_APP`+`EMAIL` parallel; statutory notices mandatory/non-suppressible; templates by `MSG-PS05-*` id.
- **X.3 Integration Framework** — outbound calls to PS12/PS10/PS01/PS09 (circuit-breaking, idempotency, payload versioning, per-integration error mapping).
- **W.1/W.2/W.3** — configured flow definitions / forms / notification config executed by P01.
- **NFR baseline** (Platform §8.2): read p95<500ms, write p95<1500ms, **99.5% uptime**, **RPO<1h**, RTO<4h, WCAG 2.1 AA, soft-delete only.

Enterprise platform-module integration touchpoints: **PS01** (employee master + org placement read/update), **PS06** (promotion-linked trigger, sanctioned-strength & seniority read-through, joining-sequence consumer), **PS10** (LPC, pay-continuity + entitlement, licence-fee recovery), **PS09** (abandonment disciplinary trigger), **PS12** (SR events on the P05 substrate), **PS13** (documents + sensitive class), **PS14** (analytics), **Holiday & Region master** (regional working-day calendar).

---

## 5. Holistic Data Model

> **Every PS05-owned table carries `tenant_id` (non-null) and `entity_id` (where entity-scoped)** and relies on **data-layer scoping** (Platform §0.1) — these are implied on every field table below and not repeated per row. **Audit is captured by the P05 DB-trigger** — PS05 does **not** define an `audit_log`; the "audit fields" notation below means the standard created/updated actor/timestamp + `is_deleted` columns the trigger reads, not a private log. **Shared/platform entities are referenced, never redefined.**

### 5.5 Enum & reference catalog

**Canonical taxonomy note** — three **orthogonal axes** (resolves enum redundancy):
- **`transfer_type` = the mechanism** by which mobility occurs.
- **`ground` = the justification** for it.
- **`priority_category` = the statutory protection** the employee holds.
A request carries one value on each axis. `TRANSFER_ON_REQUEST` is **collapsed** into `transfer_type=REQUEST` (the "on request" sense is conveyed by `request_origin=SELF`). All enums validated via `VAL-ENUM`.

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `transfer_type` (mechanism) | `REQUEST`, `ADMINISTRATIVE`, `MUTUAL`, `DEPUTATION`, `PROMOTION_LINKED`, `COMPASSIONATE` |
| `ground` (justification) | `SPOUSE`, `MEDICAL`, `ADMINISTRATIVE`, `OWN_REQUEST`, `PROMOTION`, `DEPUTATION`, `COMPASSIONATE`, `OTHER` |
| `priority_category` (protection) | `PROTECTED_SPOUSE`, `MEDICAL`, `DIFFERENTLY_ABLED`, `NEAR_RETIREMENT`, `SINGLE_PARENT`, `NONE` |

### 5.6 Data integrity rules
1. **One active SUBSTANTIVE transition per employee:** an employee may have only one `transfer_order` with `order_class=SUBSTANTIVE` in a non-terminal status (`PUBLISHED`→`JOINED`) at a time. `ADDITIONAL_CHARGE`, `DEPUTATION`, `REPATRIATION` may co-exist; a second **substantive** issuance is **`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-ACTIVE-TRANSFER`**.
2. **Relieving precondition:** a `relieving_order` may reach `ISSUED` only if its `clearance_checklist.status ∈ {CLEARED, CLEARED_WITH_DUES, CLEARED_WITH_DEEMED}` and `has_outstanding_dues` either false or `dues_recovery_ref` present — **or** a `deemed_relief` forced action is recorded (FR-PS05-016). Violation **`412 PRECONDITION_FAILED` / `ERR-PS05-CLEARANCE-INCOMPLETE`**.
3. **Joining precondition:** a `joining_report` may reach `JOINED_CONFIRMED` only if linked `transfer_order.status = IN_TRANSIT` — except `JOINING_WITHOUT_RELIEF` exceptions explicitly flagged. Violation **`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-NOT-IN-TRANSIT`**.
4. **Date monotonicity:** `order_date ≤ served_on_date ≤ relieve_by_date`; `last_working_day ≥ served_on_date`; `joining_date ≥ last_working_day`; `repatriation_due_date ≥ start_date`; `vacate_by_date ≥ last_working_day` (`VAL-DATE`/`VAL-EFFECTIVE`).
5. **Mutual symmetry & coupling:** a `MUTUAL` request requires a reciprocal request linking `mutual_counterpart_employee_id`; both orders are approved/published **atomically as a pair**, and **relieving and joining are paired-progress guarded**; asymmetric completion is **`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-MUTUAL-PAIR`**.
6. **Vacancy lifecycle:** `RESERVED → VACATED_ON_RELIEF → FILLED_ON_JOIN`. Allotment requires `vacant_count > 0` **and a transactional re-check at join time**; double-fill is **`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-VACANCY-FULL`**.
7. **Maker ≠ checker & transferee exclusion:** enforced by **P01/P02** on every approval/clearance/forced-action write; the Authority exercising a forced action is recorded and may not be the transferee.
8. **SR posting completeness via outbox:** on each of order-publish, relieve, and join, exactly one corresponding `sr_outbox` row (idempotency-key unique) must reach `DELIVERED` to **PS12**; failures retried by `JOB-PS05-OUTBOX`, dead-lettered after `max_attempts`, surfaced (FR-PS05-012).
9. **No orphan clearance:** `clearance_items` exist only with a parent `clearance_checklist`; only **configured** departments generate items/branches.
10. **SR/append-only immutability:** soft delete is never applied to records posted to PS12, to `sr_outbox`, or to `counselling_choices`; such records are cancelled/revoked/compensated with reason, not deleted (consistent with P05 immutability + Platform §8.2 no-hard-delete).
11. **Service continuity:** between `last_working_day` and `joining_date` pay is **continuous** (a single `PAY_CONTINUITY` signal to PS10, not stop+start); SR `RELIEVED`/`JOINED` carry `service_continuity_asserted=true` unless an explicit break (abandonment) is recorded.
12. **In-transit custody (no dual/zero posting):** while `IN_TRANSIT`, exactly one `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id` is set; PS01 `org_units` remains source until join; headcount counts the employee **once** against the custodian; null/two custodians is **`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-DUAL-POSTING`**.
13. **Strength read-through:** `vacancy_positions` caches carry `strength_as_of`; never written by transactional flows, only by the reconciliation job; allotment reads live where possible, falls back to cache with a staleness flag.
14. **Joining-sequence integrity:** concurrent same-cadre/same-post joinings on a date receive distinct `joining_sequence_no` ordered by `reported_date`/`joining_time` then deterministic `inter_se_tiebreak_key` (`service_no`); unique per (`dest_org_unit_id`,`dest_designation_id`,`joining_date`); exposed to PS06.
15. **Proof-of-service precedence:** `relieve_by_date` enforcement references `served_on_date` (or `DEEMED_SERVED`), never `order_date`; an order may not enter `RELIEVING_IN_PROGRESS` without a `SERVED`/`DEEMED_SERVED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED` row — else **`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-NOT-SERVED`**.
16. **Hold supremacy:** an active `STAY_HOLD` (`representation.status=HOLD_ACTIVE`) blocks all forward transitions until vacated (**`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-STAY-HOLD`**); `hold_active=true` mirrors this on `transfer_orders`.
17. **Gapless numbering:** statutory numbers issued via reserve-then-commit on `order_number_sequences` per (`scope`,`office`,`fiscal_year`); a reserved-but-uncommitted number is committed or explicitly voided with an audit row; `JOB-PS05-GAPAUDIT` shows zero unexplained gaps. Contention returns **`409 CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS05-NUMBER-LOCKED`** (retry).

## 6. Functional Requirements

> Each FR uses: ID · Module · Primary Role(s) · User Story · Description · Acceptance Criteria · Business Rules · Data Model References · API References · UI Behavior Notes · Edge Cases · Low-Level Design. **22 FRs.** All approvals run on **P01**, all authz on **P02**, all audit on **P05**, all external signals via the **`sr_outbox` on X.1/X.3**, all documents in **PS13**, all notifications via **X.2/W.3**.

### FR-PS05-001 — Transfer Request Initiation (all types)
- **Module:** PS05 · Initiation
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Transferee), Reporting Manager, HR Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** *As an employee or HR officer, I want to initiate a transfer request of any type so that mobility is captured in a structured, auditable way before an order is issued.*
- **Description:** Unified intake (a **W.2 form** referencing `VAL-*`/`VAL-PS05-*`) for all `transfer_type` values. Self-service employees raise `REQUEST`/`MUTUAL`/`COMPASSIONATE` (Me workspace); managers endorse for reports (My Team); HR Admin raises `ADMINISTRATIVE`; the system raises `PROMOTION_LINKED` from a PS06 trigger. Captures source, requested destination, ground, supporting documents (PS13), **sensitive-ground documents into the PS13 sensitive document class**, priority category, and requested effective date (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`). On submission it runs the eligibility/policy engine (FR-PS05-002) and routes via **P01 `startInstance`**. Uses the **canonical orthogonal taxonomy** (§5.5).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A request can be created in `DRAFT` and edited until `SUBMITTED`.
  2. `transfer_type` and `request_origin` mandatory (`VAL-REQUIRED`); combinations validated (`MUTUAL` requires `mutual_counterpart_employee_id`).
  3. On submit, an eligibility check runs, result stored in `eligibility_result`; a `HARD_BLOCK` prevents submission with a clear reason (`ERR-PS05-ELIGIBILITY-BLOCKED`).
  4. A unique `request_no` is generated on first submission (`VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`).
  5. Documents for `MEDICAL`/`SPOUSE`/`COMPASSIONATE` grounds are mandatory and stored in PS13 **with the sensitive class; `sensitive_ground=true` set and access is logged (P05)**.
  6. Every create/submit is captured by the **P05 trigger**; on submit a **P01 `workflow_instance`** is created (idempotent via `Idempotency-Key`; duplicate → `409`/`ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`).
- **Business Rules:** Employee origin → self only; manager → direct reports; HR Admin → org scope (P02). Promotion-linked requests are system-originated, read-only to employees. A transferee with an active **substantive** order is blocked (5.6-1).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | `transfer_requests` | Create/update primary record |
  | `employees`/`org_units` (PS01) | Validate transferee, source office |
  | `documents` (PS13) | Supporting + **sensitive-class** evidence |
  | `workflow_instances` (P01) / `audit_log` (P05) | Routing + trail |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/requests` *(Idempotency-Key)* |
  | PATCH | `/api/v1/transfers/requests/{id}` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/requests/{id}/submit` *(Idempotency-Key)* |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/requests?status=&type=&cursor=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** W.2 multi-step wizard type selector → details → grounds & documents (sensitive uploads visibly marked restricted) → review. Inline eligibility banner (green/amber/red). Mutual flow shows counterpart search & reciprocal-link confirmation. Five canonical UI states.
- **Edge Cases:** Counterpart not found/ineligible; duplicate active substantive request; sensitive-document upload failure (request stays DRAFT); promotion trigger for an employee already in transit.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `TransferRequestWizard` (W.2), `TransferRequestController`, `TransferRequestService`, `EligibilityClient`, `SensitiveDocClient(PS13)` |
  | Backend Flow | Validate role-scope (P02) → persist DRAFT → on submit call EligibilityService → if not HARD_BLOCK, generate `request_no`, set `SUBMITTED`, `WorkflowEngine.startInstance` |
  | Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `transfer_requests`; INSERT P01 `workflow_instances` (single txn); sensitive docs tagged restricted; P05 trigger captures all |
  | Validation | Type/origin matrix; mandatory sensitive-ground docs (`VAL-FILE`); date ≥ today (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`); mutual symmetry |
  | Authorization | P02 self/team/org scope; sensitive-ground read gated + access-logged |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | `DRAFT`→`SUBMITTED`→`ELIGIBILITY_CHECK`; notify recommender (X.2) |
  | Failure Handling | Eligibility upstream down → save DRAFT, block submit (X.3 error map → `500`/`ERR-LOADFAIL`); sensitive doc fail rolls back submit |
  | Dependencies | FR-PS05-002, PS01, PS13, P01, PS06 |
  | Test Guidance | Type/origin matrix; submit→P01 instance; active-substantive block; missing sensitive doc; sensitive access-log assertion |

### FR-PS05-002 — Transfer Policy & Eligibility Validation
- **Module:** PS05 · Policy & Eligibility
- **Primary Role(s):** System (engine), HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As the organisation, I want every transfer evaluated against tenure, ban-window, protected-category and sanctioned-strength policy so that no order violates statutory transfer rules.*
- **Description:** Enterprise rules engine (`VAL-PS05-ELIG`) evaluating a candidate request/order against `transfer_policy_rules` and `transfer_ban_periods` (versioned config, cascade platform→tenant→entity). Produces per-rule verdicts (`PASS`/`WARN`/`BLOCK`/`OVERRIDE_REQUIRED`) and an aggregate (most-restrictive wins). **Sanctioned-strength is read-through from PS06/PS01**, not a local store. Overrides gated to Transfer Authority (P02) with mandatory justification, captured by the P05 trigger so compliance metrics measure **un-overridden** violations.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Engine returns itemised `rule_code`, verdict, message per evaluated rule.
  2. Minimum-tenure computed from current-post DOJ (last `JOINED` order or PS01 posting date).
  3. Ban-window check is date-range and org-scope aware, honouring `exception_grounds` (`ERR-PS05-BAN-WINDOW`).
  4. Sanctioned-strength check blocks allotment when **read-through** `vacant_count = 0`.
  5. Overrides require Transfer Authority (P02) + justification, captured by P05 and in `eligibility_result`; queryable for the "0% un-overridden violation" KPI.

### FR-PS05-003 — Counselling, Vacancy Publication & Preference Capture (batch)
- **Module:** PS05 · Counselling & Preferences
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Employee, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want to publish vacancies and let eligible employees record ranked preferences so that batch allotment in a drive is transparent and seniority/merit-based.*
- **Description:** Publishes `vacancy_positions` (strength read-through; geo for Phase-2), opens a preference window (W.2 form), captures ranked preferences, and supports **batch** allotment by `SENIORITY`/`MERIT`/`PREFERENCE`/`MANUAL`. Allotment writes `vacancy_reservations` (`RESERVED`) rather than mutating a local strength counter. For cadres requiring live allotment, use the interactive session model (FR-PS05-019). Feeds FR-PS05-005/004.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Only published, in-scope vacancies are selectable.
  2. Employees add/reorder/delete preferences only within the open window.
  3. Preference ranks unique and contiguous per employee per drive.
  4. Allotment respects `allotment_method`; results create a `vacancy_reservation` (`RESERVED`) and mark `allotted=true`.
  5. Seniority score pulled from PS06 at allotment time.
- **Business Rules:** Employee must pass FR-PS05-002; reservations may not exceed read-through `vacant_count`; manual override by Authority captured by P05. **`COUNSELLING` drives use FR-PS05-019, not batch allotment.**
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_drives`, `transfer_preferences`, `vacancy_positions`, `vacancy_reservations`, `employees` (PS01).

### FR-PS05-004 — Transfer Order Generation, Gapless Numbering, Approval & Publication
- **Module:** PS05 · Approval, Numbering & Order
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want approved requests/allotments converted into a numbered, statutory transfer order and published so that source and destination offices act on a single authoritative document with a gapless statutory number.*
- **Description:** Generates a `transfer_order` (with `order_class`) from an approved request/allotment or direct admin action, routes the **P01 approval chain** (a **W.1 approval flow definition**), assigns a **gapless statutory `order_no` via reserve-then-commit on `order_number_sequences`** (per-office/per-year), renders a bilingual PDF via **PS13 document-generation**, publishes to both offices, sets `joining_distance_band`/`joining_time_days` (§16.4) and `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id` pre-set for transit, enqueues the **transfer SR event in `sr_outbox`** (FR-PS05-012), and triggers proof-of-service (FR-PS05-020). All `status` writes go through `TransferOrderStateService` (which calls P01 + P05).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Order created only from an `APPROVED` request, an allotment reservation, or a direct admin action with prior eligibility pass.
  2. Approval enforces maker ≠ checker and transferee exclusion (**P01/P02**).
  3. On approval, a **gapless** sequential `order_no` is committed (reserve-then-commit; voided reservations audited); an immutable PDF is stored in PS13.
  4. Publication sets `PUBLISHED`, notifies transferee + both offices (X.2), enqueues SR posting (outbox) and clearance-checklist creation (FR-PS05-006 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` instance), and initiates service-of-order (FR-PS05-020).
  5. Mutual orders approved/published atomically as a pair, recording `mutual_pair_order_id`.
  6. `order_class` mandatory; `SUBSTANTIVE` re-checks 5.6-1.
- **Business Rules:** Re-validate FR-PS05-002 at approval; deputation/repatriation orders create `deputation_records` (FR-PS05-011). Numbering is never "retry-on-collision" — it is reserve-then-commit.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `transfer_requests`, `order_number_sequences`, `documents` (PS13), `sr_outbox`, `workflow_instances` (P01), `clearance_checklists`, `deputation_records`, `vacancy_reservations`.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Order composer with template preview + `order_class` selector + distance band; **approval action bar** + P01 approval timeline; publish confirmation showing downstream effects (service, clearance, SR); PDF viewer.
- **Edge Cases:** Sequence row contention (row-lock → `409`/`ERR-PS05-NUMBER-LOCKED`, retry); PDF render failure (order stays `APPROVED`, publish blocked, reserved number voided + audited); ban window now active; reservation expired meanwhile.

### FR-PS05-005 — Bulk Transfer Drive Management
- **Module:** PS05 · Bulk Drives
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As HR Admin, I want to run an annual/seasonal transfer drive that batch-processes hundreds of transfers so that large cadre movements are efficient and consistent.*
- **Description:** Manages a `transfer_drive` lifecycle: scope/cadre, publish vacancies, open preference window (FR-PS05-003) **or run a counselling session (FR-PS05-019)**, allot, and **batch-generate orders** (FR-PS05-004) via the **`JOB-PS05-DRIVE` background job (X.1 runner)** with progress tracking, partial-failure isolation, and a dashboard. CSV import + bulk eligibility pre-screen. Vacancy reservations carry the lifecycle that prevents **cascading double-fill** at join time.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Drive progresses `DRAFT`→`OPEN`→`COUNSELLING`→`ALLOTTED`→`ORDERS_ISSUED`→`CLOSED`.
  2. Bulk eligibility pre-screen flags blocked candidates before allotment.
  3. Batch order generation is resumable (X.1 idempotent per-period run key); a failed candidate quarantines, not aborts.
  4. Dashboard shows counts by stage and pendency.
  5. Closing requires all allotted candidates to have orders issued or be explicitly excluded.
  6. Reservation-to-order transition re-checks `vacant_count > 0` transactionally.
- **Business Rules:** Per-candidate eligibility (FR-002) and substantive-uniqueness (5.6-1); ban-window applies drive-wide unless exempted.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_drives`, `transfer_preferences`, `vacancy_positions`, `vacancy_reservations`, `transfer_requests`, `transfer_orders`.

### FR-PS05-006 — Relieving: No-Dues / Clearance as a P01 PARALLEL_ALL_OF Flow (SLA escalation & deemed clearance)
- **Module:** PS05 · Relieving — Clearance
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source), Clearance Officers, Estate Officer, Employee
- **User Story:** *As a source HR officer, I want a departmental no-dues checklist auto-created on order publication, with SLAs and an escalation path, so that one non-responsive officer cannot block relieving indefinitely.*
- **Description:** On publication a `clearance_checklist` is created as the subject of a **P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` workflow instance** with **one branch per configured clearance department** of the source office (offices with fewer departments open fewer branches; the instance joins only when **every** branch completes). Each branch carries a **P01 SLA** (`sla_due_at`); on breach the **P01 SLA runtime** emits an escalation event → X.2 notification + P05 audit, advancing `OFFICER → DEPT_HEAD → AUTHORITY`. The Authority may grant `DEEMED_CLEARED` with reason (FR-PS05-016). Checklist reaches `CLEARED`, `CLEARED_WITH_DUES`, or `CLEARED_WITH_DEEMED`. Gates relieving (FR-PS05-008).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Checklist auto-created as a `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` instance with one branch/item per **configured** department.
  2. Only the assigned Clearance Officer (P01 branch assignee) or HR override with reason updates a branch.
  3. Outstanding dues require `dues_amount`/description; checklist cannot reach `CLEARED` with open dues unless `CLEARED_WITH_DUES` (`dues_recovery_ref`).
  4. Each branch has a P01 SLA; breaches escalate through tiers via the P01 SLA runtime with X.2 notifications.
  5. Authority `DEEMED_CLEARED` requires `forced_action_reason` + `forced_action_by`; counts toward `deemed_items`.
  6. Every change captured by the P05 trigger.
- **Business Rules:** Clearance Officer ≠ transferee (P02); dues link to PS10 recovery; `WAIVED`/`DEEMED_CLEARED` require Authority approval (audited).
- **Data Model References:** `clearance_checklists`, `clearance_items`, `transfer_orders`, `documents` (PS13), `workflow_instances` (P01), `notifications` (X.2).

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Clearance board per-department cards with **SLA countdown + escalation badge**; officer action drawer (approval action bar); Authority "deem cleared" action with mandatory reason; employee tracker.
- **Edge Cases:** Department has no officer (auto-escalate to dept-head queue per P01 assignee fallback); dues disputed; officer on leave (delegate via P01 or auto-escalate); office with zero configured departments (no branches → checklist auto-`CLEARED`).

### FR-PS05-007 — Charge Handover at Source (with handover-under-protest)
- **Module:** PS05 · Relieving — Charge Handover
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (relinquishing), Charge Receiving Officer, HR Officer (Source), Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a relieving employee, I want to formally hand over charge — and where a dispute would trap me, hand over under protest within a time-bound resolution — so accountability transfers without indefinite blocking.*
- **Description:** Records a `charge_handover` (phase `HANDOVER_SOURCE`) of assets, pending files, cash/imprest, and a note (PS13). Receiving officer/successor (or **link officer / custody-of-office where no successor exists**) accepts or disputes. A dispute starts a **time-bound resolution clock (`dispute_sla_due_at`, P01 SLA / `JOB-PS05-DISPUTE-SLA`)**; on breach, the Authority may certify **handover-under-protest** (FR-PS05-016), unblocking relieving while preserving the dispute for separate resolution.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Handover captures asset inventory, cash/imprest, pending files, note document (PS13).
  2. Receiving officer can `ACCEPT` or `DISPUTE` with remarks.
  3. A dispute does **not** block relieving indefinitely: after `dispute_sla_due_at`, Authority `HANDOVER_UNDER_PROTEST` is available with reason.
  4. Charge type (`FULL`/`ADDITIONAL`/`CURRENT_DUTIES`) recorded; `ADDITIONAL_CHARGE` orders never block a substantive relieving.
- **Business Rules:** Relinquisher ≠ acceptor (P02); cash/imprest mismatch flags an accounts clearance dependency (FR-006); under-protest preserves the dispute record and notifies Accounts/Authority (X.2).
- **Data Model References:** `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `employees` (PS01), `documents` (PS13).

### FR-PS05-008 — Relieving Order, Last Working Day & Pay-Continuity Signal
- **Module:** PS05 · Relieving — Order & LWD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source), Transfer Authority, Payroll Officer
- **User Story:** *As source HR, I want to issue a relieving order setting the last working day once clearance and handover are complete (or deemed) so that the employee is formally relieved and pay is continued — not stopped — across the handoff.*
- **Description:** Issues a `relieving_order` once clearance (FR-006) and handover (FR-007) preconditions are met **or a `deemed_relief` Authority action is recorded** (FR-016). Sets `last_working_day` (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`, staged via `JOB-PS05-EFFDATE`), relieving time (FN/AN — load-bearing, §16.9), generates the relieving order PDF (PS13), enqueues a **`PAY_CONTINUITY` + `LPC_REQUEST` signal to PS10 via `sr_outbox`** (not a pay-stop), sets `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id` and transitions the order `RELIEVED`→`IN_TRANSIT` (via `TransferOrderStateService`), marks the `vacancy_reservation` `VACATED_ON_RELIEF`, enforces **mutual paired-progress**, and enqueues the **relieving SR event to PS12 asserting no break in service** (FR-012/015).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Relieving order issued only when clearance ∈ {CLEARED, CLEARED_WITH_DUES, CLEARED_WITH_DEEMED} and (if required) handover ACCEPTED/UNDER_PROTEST — **or** `deemed_relief` recorded.
  2. `last_working_day ≥ served_on_date` and ≤ `relieve_by_date` (late relief flagged, not hard-blocked); enforcement uses **served date**.
  3. On issue: PDF stored (PS13), **pay-continuity + LPC** enqueued to PS10, SR `RELIEVING` event enqueued to PS12 via `/sr/ingest` (`service_continuity_asserted=true`), order → `IN_TRANSIT`, custody set, reservation vacated.
  4. Unique gapless `relieving_order_no` generated.
  5. For `MUTUAL`, the counterpart's progress is checked; asymmetric completion blocked (5.6-5).
- **Business Rules:** Pay is continued (continuity signal), LPC requested exactly once; relieving beyond `relieve_by_date` requires remark; deemed-relief requires Authority + reason (P02).

### FR-PS05-009 — Transfer-in-Transit & Joining-Time Management (regional working-day calendar)
- **Module:** PS05 · Transit Management
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source/Destination), Employee, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want the period between relieving and joining tracked with admissible joining time computed against a proper regional working-day calendar so transit is visible, paid, controlled, and not abused.*
- **Description:** Maintains `IN_TRANSIT` between LWD and joining. Computes admissible **joining time by distance band** (§16.4) using the platform **Holiday & Region master** (Org Admin Master Data; `VAL-HOL-RECUR`/`VAL-REGION-STATE`) — the v1 silent "Sat/Sun + national holidays" fallback is removed; an unavailable calendar defers the computation (X.3 error map → `ERR-LOADFAIL`), never silently wrong. Monitors elapsed transit via **`JOB-PS05-TRANSIT`** (X.1), flags overdue, exposes an in-transit register, and shows the **in-transit custodian** for each employee.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Orders display `IN_TRANSIT` with day counter, admissible-by date, and **custodian office**.
  2. Joining-time computation uses the Holiday & Region master and `joining_distance_band`; no silent default.
  3. Transit exceeding admissible time raises overdue flag + X.2 notification to both offices.
  4. In-transit register lists employees with source/destination, custodian, and elapsed days.
- **Business Rules:** Transit is bounded by policy and **paid** (FR-015); extension of joining time requires Authority approval (P02, recorded); unjoined beyond grace triggers `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW` (FR-018).
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders` (transit/custody), `relieving_orders`, `joining_reports`, Holiday & Region master (read).

### FR-PS05-010 — Joining Report & Charge Assumption at Destination
- **Module:** PS05 · Joining
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Transferee), HR Officer (Destination), Charge Receiving Officer, Payroll Officer
- **User Story:** *As a transferred employee, I want to submit a joining report and assume charge so my joining date is confirmed, pay continuity resumes at destination, and my posting is updated.*
- **Description:** Transferee submits a `joining_report`; destination HR verifies (P01), records charge assumption (`ASSUMPTION_DEST`), confirms the statutory `joining_date` (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`), computes transit vs admissible, **assigns the inter-se joining sequence (FR-021)**, **re-checks the vacancy reservation transactionally and marks it `FILLED_ON_JOIN`**, enqueues a **`PAY_CONTINUITY` resume + `POSTING_UPDATE` to PS01 via `sr_outbox`** (PS01 owns the org-placement update), clears `in_transit_custody` (PS01 becomes authoritative), enforces **mutual paired-progress**, and enqueues the **joining SR event to PS12 asserting no break in service** (FR-012/015). Late joining routes to FR-018.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Joining report submitted only against an `IN_TRANSIT` order (exception: `JOINING_WITHOUT_RELIEF` flagged).
  2. Destination HR verification confirms `joining_date`; transit + admissibility computed.
  3. On confirmation: charge assumption recorded, **reservation re-check + FILLED_ON_JOIN**, pay-continuity resumed (PS10), PS01 posting updated, **joining sequence assigned**, SR `JOINING` enqueued via `/sr/ingest` (continuity asserted), order → `JOINED`.
  4. Late joining (beyond admissible + grace) routes to `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW` (FR-018) before confirmation.
  5. Unique gapless `joining_report_no` generated; **mutual counterpart coupling enforced**.
- **Business Rules:** `joining_date ≥ LWD`; **PS01 owns the posting change** (single authoritative org-placement update, via PS01 service/outbox); deputation joining updates `deputation_records` start (FR-011); reservation double-fill blocked (`ERR-PS05-VACANCY-FULL`).
- **Data Model References:** `joining_reports`, `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `vacancy_reservations`, `employees`/`org_units` (PS01), `sr_outbox`, `deputation_records`.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Joining wizard (report → charge assumption → confirm); HR verification with transit summary + **joining-sequence assignment**; late-joining banner with review action.
- **Edge Cases:** Reported but charge not available; joining before relieving processed; date disputes; promotion-linked designation change; **reservation filled by another joiner (concurrency)**; mutual counterpart not yet relieved.

### FR-PS05-011 — Deputation Terms & Repatriation Management
- **Module:** PS05 · Deputation & Repatriation
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority, Employee
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want to manage deputation tenure, terms, extensions and repatriation so lent employees return on time and terms are tracked.*
- **Description:** For `DEPUTATION` orders, maintains a `deputation_record` (borrowing/lending units, terms, tenure, extensions with caps, repatriation due/status). Generates repatriation alerts via **`JOB-PS05-REPAT-REMIND`** (X.1) and processes repatriation as a reverse transfer with `order_class=REPATRIATION` (reusing FR-004/006/008/010) — which **legitimately co-exists** with the original deputation during overlap (5.6-1).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Deputation record auto-created when a deputation order is published.
  2. Extension requests validated against `max_tenure_months`; over-cap blocked (`422`/`ERR-PS05-DEPUTATION-CAP`).
  3. Repatriation-due alerts raised ahead of `current_end_date`.
  4. Repatriation initiates a reverse `REPATRIATION`-class order to the lending unit.
- **Business Rules:** Terms in `deputation_terms`; external borrowing units are `org_units` type `EXTERNAL`; max tenure enforced by policy (FR-002).
- **Data Model References:** `deputation_records`, `transfer_orders` (order_class), `org_units` (P04), `employees` (PS01).

### FR-PS05-012 — Service Register (SR) Event Posting to PS12 via Transactional Outbox
- **Module:** PS05 · SR Posting
- **Primary Role(s):** System, SR Custodian/Registrar
- **User Story:** *As the SR custodian, I want every transfer, relieving and joining event reliably posted to the PS12 Digital SR so the statutory service record is complete, accurate, and asserts continuous service.*
- **Description:** Posts append-only SR events to the **PS12 SR ledger** (which runs on the **P05 audit/immutability substrate**) at the checkpoints `TRANSFER` (and `MUTUAL_TRANSFER` for mutual exchanges), `RELIEVING` and `JOINING` — the **exact `event_type` codes published by PS12 for PS05** — using the **PS04-style fully field-specified `sr_outbox`** (§5.2.15). PS12 froze the SR ingestion contract; PS05 is a writer. Every `PS12_SR` outbox row **relays to the canonical write-port `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (reversals to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal`) via **X.3**, dispatched by **`JOB-PS05-OUTBOX` (X.1)** — no direct SR-table INSERT, no `/api/v1/sr/events`. Each ingest call carries the dedup tuple `(source_module="PS05", source_reference_id, source_event_version)`, the qualifying-service **`fact_key`** (required), and explicit `tenant_id`+`entity_id` on the payload. Idempotency keys follow the documented formula; retry uses exponential backoff with `max_attempts`; exhausted rows are `DEAD_LETTERED` and surfaced for the Custodian. The same outbox separately carries PS10 (`PAY_CONTINUITY`,`ENTITLEMENT`,`LPC_REQUEST`,`LICENCE_FEE_RECOVERY`), PS01 (`POSTING_UPDATE`), PS06 (`SENIORITY_FEED`) and PS09 (`DISCIPLINARY_TRIGGER`) signals. `RELIEVING`/`JOINING` payloads carry `service_continuity_asserted`.
- **SR ingest payload contract (PS12-frozen envelope):** every `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` body MUST populate: `source_module="PS05"` (explicit, not inferred), `source_reference_id` (the originating PS05 aggregate/checkpoint reference), `source_event_version`, `event_type` (one of the published PS05 codes above), **`fact_key`** (derived per the event type's `fact_correlation_rule`; missing → `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED`), `tenant_id`, `entity_id`, plus the event body (`order_no`, source/destination `org_units`, dates, `service_continuity_asserted` for RELIEVING/JOINING). Reversals use `is_reversal=true`+`reverses_source_reference_id` (see FR-013), never a `COMPENSATING` type.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Exactly one SR event per checkpoint per order (idempotent via key formula).
  2. Failed postings retried; exhausted → `DEAD_LETTERED` + surfaced to Custodian (X.2 `MSG-PS05-SR-FAILED`).
  3. SR payload includes order_no, source/destination, dates, event type, **continuity assertion**, references.
  4. A reconciliation report lists orders with missing/failed SR events and outbox dead-letters.
- **Business Rules:** SR events immutable (PS12 on P05 substrate); corrections **supersede, never delete** — a correction posts the published `*_CANCELLED` partner type via the PS12 envelope (`is_reversal=true`+`reverses_source_reference_id`), and PS12 auto-spawns the corrigendum (no invented `COMPENSATING` type); outbox writes share the local DB transaction; failures never block local state.
- **Data Model References:** `sr_outbox`, `service_register_events` (PS12), `transfer_orders`, `relieving_orders`, `joining_reports`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/sr/ingest` (canonical PS12 ledger write-port, via X.3) |
  | POST | `/api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal` (PS12 reversal write-port, via X.3) |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/sr-reconciliation?status=pending&cursor=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/sr-outbox/{id}/retry` |

  > The `/api/v1/transfers/sr-outbox/{id}/retry` and `sr-reconciliation` paths are PS05-local façades over the `sr_outbox`; **they relay to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` (and `/api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal`)** — they do not write the SR ledger directly.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** SR reconciliation console (SR Custodian) listing `PENDING`/`FAILED`/`DEAD_LETTERED` outbox rows with retry; per-order SR timeline.
- **Edge Cases:** PS12 down at checkpoint; duplicate retry (idempotency key dedupes); partial payload; clock skew; dead-letter after `max_attempts`.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `SrOutboxWriter`, `OutboxPublisherJob(JOB-PS05-OUTBOX)`, `SrReconciliationService`, `X.3 clients (PS12/PS10/PS01/PS09/PS06)` |
  | Backend Flow | On checkpoint INSERT outbox row (same txn) → `JOB-PS05-OUTBOX` dispatches by `target_system` via X.3 with idempotency key → mark `DELIVERED`/`FAILED` → backoff → `DEAD_LETTERED` |

### FR-PS05-013 — Order Amendment, Cancellation & Post-Relief Revocation
- **Module:** PS05 · Amendment / Cancellation
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want to amend, cancel or revoke a transfer order at the correct lifecycle stage so corrections and recalls are handled with full audit and statutory compensation.*
- **Description:** Three stage-aware corrective actions (each a **P01 approval flow**): **amend** (pre-relief — supersede with `revision_no`++, new gapless PDF, reversal SR), **cancel** (pre-relief — close order, reverse clearance/handover/reservation, notify), **revoke** (post-relief/join — recall requiring reversal SR, **PS01 posting reversal**, **pay-continuity reversal/reconciliation** to PS10). Reversal SR is posted to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal` using the PS12 envelope (`is_reversal=true`+`reverses_source_reference_id`) with the published `*_CANCELLED` partner type (`TRANSFER_CANCELLED`/`RELIEVING_CANCELLED`/`JOINING_CANCELLED`) — **supersede, never delete**. All require Authority approval + justification (P02); all `status` writes via `TransferOrderStateService`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Amendment only pre-relief; new revision via `superseded_by_order_id`; reserved number committed/voided gaplessly.
  2. Cancellation pre-relief; reverses clearance/handover and **releases vacancy reservation**; notifies stakeholders (X.2).
  3. Revocation (post-relief/join) enqueues a reversal SR (`*_CANCELLED`, `is_reversal=true`+`reverses_source_reference_id`) + **pay-continuity reconciliation** signal to PS10 and PS01 reversal.
  4. Every action requires justification + Authority approval (P01/P02); captured by P05 trigger.
- **Business Rules:** SR-posted records never hard-deleted (5.6-10); revocation after joining reverses PS01 posting via PS01 API with reason; active `STAY_HOLD` must be vacated or the action recorded as hold-driven.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `clearance_checklists`, `charge_handovers`, `joining_reports`, `vacancy_reservations`, `sr_outbox`, `employees` (PS01).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/amend` |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Stage-aware action menu (only valid actions enabled); justification-required modal (`ERR-REASON-REQ`); impact preview listing reversals (clearance, reservation, SR, PS01, pay).
- **Edge Cases:** Amend after clearance started; cancel after partial clearance; revoke after pay paid (reconciliation); concurrent amend + relieving; active hold.

### FR-PS05-014 — Geographic Mapping & Transfer Analytics Dashboard (Phase-2 map)
- **Module:** PS05 · Mapping & Analytics
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority, Auditor, Reporting Manager
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want analytics on transfers, pendency, clearance, transit, custody and SR health so I can monitor mobility health and act on bottlenecks.*
- **Description:** Dashboard (feeding/surfaced via **PS14**, role-scoped `analytics.*`) with analytics: transfers by type/class/stage, relieving pendency, clearance bottlenecks (incl. P01 SLA breaches/deemed-clearances), in-transit/overdue counts **with custody integrity checks**, SR/outbox health, drive progress, deputation tenure, **representation/stay-hold load, abandonment counts, quarter overstays**. The **geographic map is re-prioritised to Phase-2**; analytics ship in baseline.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. KPI cards show counts for each lifecycle stage, overdue/pending, **custody-integrity exceptions, un-overridden violations, dead-letters**.
  2. Clearance bottleneck view ranks departments by average clearance time and SLA-breach rate.
  3. All figures respect row-level org scope (P02); Auditor sees all read-only.
  4. Data exportable (CSV/PDF) with cursor pagination.
  5. **Map view delivered as a Phase-2 enhancement** behind a feature flag.
- **Business Rules:** Aggregations read-only; no PII beyond role scope (PII ceiling); numbers reconcile with operational records.
- **Data Model References:** all PS05 entities (read), incl. `transfer_representations`, `quarter_allotments`, `sr_outbox`.
- **API References:**

### FR-PS05-015 — Service Continuity, Joining-Time Pay & In-Transit Custody (Critical)
- **Module:** PS05 · Service Continuity & Custody
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source/Destination), Transfer Authority, Payroll Officer, SR Custodian
- **User Story:** *As the organisation, I want the transit/joining-time period treated as continuous paid service owned by a defined custodian office, so employees are never underpaid and headcount is never dual- or zero-counted.*
- **Description:** Replaces the v1 pay-stop/pay-start model. On relieving, PS10 receives a single **`PAY_CONTINUITY`** signal (continue pay across the handoff) plus an **`ENTITLEMENT`** signal keyed on `transfer_type`+`ground` (own-request vs administrative differ in TTA, transfer grant, joining-time-pay admissibility), both via the `sr_outbox`. The transit period is **paid duty/leave** (`joining_time_pay_admissible`). An explicit **in-transit custodian** owns pay/attendance/leave/headcount/discipline during `IN_TRANSIT`, with an integrity rule preventing dual/zero posting (5.6-12). SR `RELIEVING`/`JOINING` events assert **no break in qualifying service** (5.6-11).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Relieving enqueues a `PAY_CONTINUITY` (not pay-stop) signal and an `ENTITLEMENT` signal keyed on `transfer_type`+`ground`.
  2. `joining_time_pay_admissible` computed by policy (`JOINING_TIME_PAY` rule) and stored on the order.
  3. While `IN_TRANSIT`, exactly one custodian office is set; dual/null custody is blocked (`409`/`ERR-PS05-DUAL-POSTING`).
  4. SR `RELIEVING` and `JOINING` events carry `service_continuity_asserted=true` unless an explicit break (abandonment) is recorded.
  5. Headcount/budget reports count the in-transit employee exactly once (against custodian).
- **Business Rules:** Custodian defaults to destination for substantive transfers (configurable per policy); own-request transfers may have reduced joining-time-pay per rule; abandonment (FR-018) breaks continuity explicitly.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders` (`in_transit_custody_org_unit_id`,`joining_time_pay_admissible`,`entitlement_ref`), `relieving_orders` (`pay_continuity_signalled`), `joining_reports` (`service_continuity_asserted`,`pay_continuity_resumed`), `sr_outbox`, `transfer_policy_rules`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/custody` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/custody` (set/override custodian) |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/entitlement` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Order detail shows custodian office, continuity status, entitlement reference; relieving/joining confirmation explicitly states "pay continued" (never "pay stopped"); headcount reports flag custody.
- **Edge Cases:** Custodian office dissolved mid-transit (re-assign + audit); own-request with no joining-time pay; abandonment breaking continuity; entitlement service (PS10) unavailable (outbox retry).
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `ServiceContinuityService`, `CustodyAssigner`, `EntitlementSignalClient(PS10)`, `SrOutboxWriter` |
  | Backend Flow | On relieve: compute `joining_time_pay_admissible`, set custodian, enqueue `PAY_CONTINUITY`+`ENTITLEMENT`; on join: resume continuity, clear custody (PS01 authoritative) |
  | Data Operations | UPDATE `transfer_orders`,`relieving_orders`,`joining_reports`; INSERT `sr_outbox`; P05 trigger |
  | Validation | Single-custodian invariant (5.6-12); continuity assertion (5.6-11); entitlement keying |
  | Authorization | HR set; Authority override custodian (P02) |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Continuity + custody fields; PS10 entitlement/continuity; SR continuity assertion |
  | Failure Handling | PS10 via outbox retry; dual/null custody → `409`/`ERR-PS05-DUAL-POSTING` |
  | Dependencies | FR-008/010/012/018, PS10, PS12 |

### FR-PS05-016 — Authority Forced-Action Powers (deemed-clearance, handover-under-protest, deemed-relief)
- **Module:** PS05 · Authority Forced-Action
- **Primary Role(s):** Transfer Authority, HR Officer (initiator), Auditor
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want a single, audited forced-action power to break human-conflict deadlocks — non-responsive clearance, hostile handover, source refusing to relieve — so an employee is never trapped indefinitely.*
- **Description:** One mechanism (`forced_action_type`) covering: `DEEMED_CLEARED` (after P01 SLA + escalation `OFFICER→DEPT_HEAD→AUTHORITY`, FR-006), `HANDOVER_UNDER_PROTEST` (after dispute SLA, FR-007), and `DEEMED_RELIEF`/`stand_relieved` (FR-008). Each requires a Transfer Authority (P02), a mandatory `forced_action_reason`, and the mutated row carries reason + actor captured by the **P05 trigger**; the transferee may never be the granting Authority (SoD via P01/P02).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Each forced action is gated to Transfer Authority + mandatory reason + recorded approver (P02 + P05).
  2. `DEEMED_CLEARED` only after the branch's P01 SLA breach and escalation chain exhausted (or Authority-justified emergency).
  3. `HANDOVER_UNDER_PROTEST` only after `dispute_sla_due_at`; preserves the underlying dispute.
  4. `DEEMED_RELIEF` issues/marks a relieving order with `deemed_relief=true`, satisfying the relieving precondition (5.6-2).
  5. Every forced action independently queryable for audit/analytics (P05 / PS14).
- **Business Rules:** Forced actions do not erase dues/disputes — they unblock the lifecycle while the financial/charge dispute proceeds separately (and may signal PS10 recovery). Transferee-exclusion enforced.
- **Data Model References:** `clearance_items`, `charge_handovers`, `relieving_orders` (forced-action fields), `audit_log` (P05).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/clearance/items/{id}/deem-cleared` |

  | POST | `/api/v1/relieving-orders/{id}/deemed-relieve` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/forced-actions?type=&cursor=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Authority-only forced-action drawer with mandatory reason (≥ 20 chars, `VAL-COMMENT`), escalation/dispute context shown, confirmation listing downstream effects; forced-action audit log view (P05).
- **Edge Cases:** Forced action attempted before SLA/escalation exhausted (blocked `409`/`ERR-PS05-FORCED-PRECOND` unless emergency-justified); transferee attempts self-forced-action (`403`/`ERR-FORBIDDEN`); concurrent forced action + officer clearance.

- **User Story:** *As the organisation, I want representations, court/tribunal stays, and retention requests to pause a transfer order at any pre-join stage with full audit, so contested transfers are handled lawfully instead of forcing an irreversible move.*
- **Description:** `transfer_representations` entity and `STAY_HOLD` order status. A representation/stay/retention request can be filed against an order and decided through a **P01 decision flow**; when upheld or a court stay is in force, the order is set `STAY_HOLD` (`hold_active=true`), blocking all forward transitions (5.6-16) until vacated. Decisions (`ALLOW`/`DENY`/`MODIFY`/`VACATE`) are recorded with authority and validity. Stay-order documents are stored in PS13.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A representation/stay/retention can be filed against any order pre-join, referencing a PS13 document and authority/case number.
  2. An upheld representation or active court stay transitions the order to `STAY_HOLD` and sets `hold_active=true`.
  3. While `hold_active`, no forward transition (relieve/join) is permitted (`409`/`ERR-PS05-STAY-HOLD`).
  4. Vacating the hold (`VACATE`/expiry) restores the prior status via `TransferOrderStateService` with P05 audit.
  5. All filings/decisions are audited (P05) and visible to Auditor.
- **Business Rules:** Court stays (`COURT_STAY`) may only be vacated on recorded court order/expiry; retention requests follow Authority decision (P01/P02); holds do not delete the order.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_representations`, `transfer_orders` (`status`,`hold_active`), `documents` (PS13), `audit_log` (P05).

### FR-PS05-018 — Non-Joining / Abandonment Resolution
- **Module:** PS05 · Non-Joining / Abandonment
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Destination), Transfer Authority, Disciplinary Authority (PS09)
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want a defined path for an employee who never joins beyond grace, so they do not sit in permanent IN_TRANSIT limbo with undefined pay and posting.*
- **Description:** When transit exceeds admissible + grace, the joining report enters `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW`. The Authority decides (P01) between **`REVERT_TO_SOURCE`** (re-join at source as a reverse joining, restoring source posting + custody) and **`ABANDONED`** (continuity break recorded, **PS09 disciplinary trigger** raised via outbox). The limbo-period pay status is explicitly defined (continuity until grace; thereafter per Authority decision — paid pending inquiry or stopped on abandonment), signalled to PS10.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Transit beyond admissible + grace routes the joining report to `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW`.
  2. Authority decides `REVERT_TO_SOURCE` or `ABANDONED` with mandatory reason (P02).
  3. `REVERT_TO_SOURCE` restores source posting/custody (via PS01) and records a reverse joining (order → `REVERTED_TO_SOURCE`).
  4. `ABANDONED` records a continuity break (`service_continuity_asserted=false`), raises a **PS09 disciplinary trigger** (outbox), and sets pay status per decision (order → `ABANDONED`).
  5. The limbo-period pay treatment is recorded and signalled to PS10.
- **Business Rules:** Abandonment is the only path that breaks service continuity (5.6-11 exception); revert-to-source re-uses joining mechanics in reverse; the PS09 trigger is a signal, not a proceeding (owned by PS09).
- **Data Model References:** `joining_reports` (`status`), `transfer_orders` (`status`,custody), `sr_outbox` (PS09/PS10 signals), `audit_log` (P05).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Late-joining review queue; Authority decision modal (revert vs abandon) with reason and pay-status selector; outcome banner.
- **Edge Cases:** Employee joins during review (cancel review); revert when source post already filled (additional/supernumerary handling); abandonment then later representation.

### FR-PS05-019 — Interactive Counselling Session
- **Module:** PS05 · Interactive Counselling
- **Primary Role(s):** Transfer Authority / Presiding Officer, HR Admin, Employee
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority running a cadre counselling, I want candidates called in seniority/merit order to choose live from remaining vacancies with an immutable choice log, so allotment is observed, contestable, and defensible in a tribunal.*
- **Description:** For `drive_type=COUNSELLING`, a `counselling_session` is created with a per-candidate turn order (`SENIORITY`/`MERIT`). This is a **enterprise-authored live allotment surface on the P05 audit substrate — it does not re-implement P01**; it feeds the P01 order flow (FR-004). When a candidate's turn is live, the system **locks the candidate's available vacancies** (one live turn at a time), the candidate chooses (or passes/declines), and an **immutable `counselling_choices` row** (append-only, P05-captured) is recorded by the presiding officer. The chosen vacancy converts to a `vacancy_reservation` and feeds order generation. The batch path (FR-003) remains for `SENIORITY`/`MERIT`/`MANUAL` drives — the two coexist, selected by `drive_type`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Candidates ordered by `turn_order_method`; only the current-turn candidate may choose (`409`/`ERR-PS05-COUNSEL-TURN` otherwise).
  2. During a live turn the chosen-from vacancy set is locked; no concurrent allotment of the same vacancy.
  3. Each choice (`CHOSEN`/`PASSED`/`DECLINED`/`AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT`/`ABSENT`) recorded immutably with timestamp and recording officer.
  4. A turn times out after `turn_timeout_seconds` → `AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT` (`JOB-PS05-COUNSEL-TIMEOUT`).
  5. A `CHOSEN` vacancy becomes a `RESERVED` `vacancy_reservation`; the choice log is append-only and exportable.
- **Business Rules:** Candidates must pass FR-002; choice log never edited/deleted (5.6-10); presiding officer records on behalf (observed); seniority ties broken deterministically by `service_no`.
- **Data Model References:** `counselling_sessions`, `counselling_choices`, `vacancy_positions`, `vacancy_reservations`, `transfer_drives`, `employees` (PS01).

  | GET | `/api/v1/counselling-sessions/{id}/choices?cursor=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Presiding console showing turn queue, live candidate, remaining vacancies (locked during turn), record-choice action, countdown timer; public choice-log view for transparency.
- **Edge Cases:** Candidate absent (`ABSENT`, turn advances); two officers recording simultaneously (single live turn lock); vacancy exhausted before a turn; session paused/resumed.

  | Data Operations | INSERT `counselling_sessions`; append `counselling_choices`; `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` vacancy lock; INSERT `vacancy_reservations`; P05 trigger |
  | Validation | Single live turn; current-turn-only choice; timeout; tie-break |
  | Authorization | Presiding Officer/HR Admin record; employee views own turn (P02) |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Session `SCHEDULED`→`IN_PROGRESS`→`COMPLETED`; reservations created |
  | Failure Handling | Officer disconnect → turn lock TTL; timeout auto-pass |

### FR-PS05-020 — Order Proof-of-Service & Acknowledgement
- **Module:** PS05 · Proof-of-Service
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Employee, Transfer Authority, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want recorded proof that the transfer order was served on the employee and (where possible) acknowledged, so relieve-by deadlines and non-compliance discipline rest on the served date, not the order date.*
- **Description:** On publication, the order is served through a `delivery_channel` (in-app/email/SMS via **X.2**; registered-post/hand-delivery/published-notice manual) and an `order_acknowledgements` row records `served_on_date`. The employee may acknowledge (`ACKNOWLEDGED`, W.2 ack control); non-acknowledgement after policy time, or returned registered post / published notice, yields `DEEMED_SERVED` (`JOB-PS05-SERVE-DEEM`); refusal yields `REFUSED`. `transfer_orders.served_on_date`/`acknowledged_at` mirror the canonical record, and **`relieve_by_date` enforcement references the served date** (5.6-15).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Publication creates an acknowledgement row with channel and `served_on_date`.
  2. Employee acknowledgement sets `ACKNOWLEDGED` + `acknowledged_at`.
  3. Non-ack within policy window / returned post / published notice → `DEEMED_SERVED` with reason; refusal → `REFUSED`.
  4. An order cannot enter `RELIEVING_IN_PROGRESS` without a `SERVED`/`DEEMED_SERVED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED` row (5.6-15 → `409`/`ERR-PS05-NOT-SERVED`).
  5. `relieve_by_date` computed from `served_on_date`, not `order_date`.
- **Business Rules:** Registered-post/hand-delivery require a `proof_document_id` (PS13); deemed-served requires recorded reason; served date is the statutory basis for non-compliance.
- **Data Model References:** `order_acknowledgements`, `transfer_orders` (`served_on_date`,`acknowledged_at`,`relieve_by_date`), `documents` (PS13), `notifications` (X.2).
- **API References:**

  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/service-record` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Service panel (channel selector, proof upload, served date); employee acknowledgement prompt on My Transfers (Me workspace); deemed-served action with reason; service-record timeline.

### FR-PS05-021 — Joining-Sequence & Inter-se Seniority Integrity
- **Module:** PS05 · Joining-Sequence & Seniority
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Destination), System, Transfer Authority, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want a defensible inter-se joining order when several transferees join the same cadre/post, because joining-date order sets seniority that PS06 consumes and that transfer litigation hinges on.*
- **Description:** On joining confirmation, assigns `joining_sequence_no` ordered by `reported_date` then `joining_time` (FN before AN) then a deterministic `inter_se_tiebreak_key` (default `service_no`) for joiners sharing (`dest_org_unit_id`,`dest_designation_id`,`joining_date`). The tuple is unique (5.6-14) and **exposed to PS06 via the `SENIORITY_FEED` outbox event** so seniority computation is reproducible and contestable.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Concurrent same-cadre/post joinings on a date receive distinct, contiguous `joining_sequence_no`.
  2. Ordering is `reported_date` → `joining_time` (FN<AN) → `inter_se_tiebreak_key`.
  3. The sequence tuple is unique per (`dest_org_unit_id`,`dest_designation_id`,`joining_date`).
  4. The sequence + tie-break key exposed to PS06 (outbox).
  5. Authority may adjust sequence only with recorded justification (P05 audited).
- **Business Rules:** Tie-break deterministic (`service_no` default; policy-configurable, `VAL-PS05-SENIORITY`); manual re-sequencing is Authority-only and audited; the sequence feeds PS06 but seniority math is owned by PS06.
- **Data Model References:** `joining_reports` (`joining_sequence_no`,`inter_se_tiebreak_key`), PS06 (consumer), `audit_log` (P05).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/joining-sequence?office=&designation=&date=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/resequence` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Destination HR joining-sequence grid for the date showing computed order; Authority re-sequence action with justification; PS06 export indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Same reported_date + same FN/AN + tie-break collision (impossible by `service_no` uniqueness); back-dated joining; re-sequencing after PS06 consumption (compensating notice).
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `JoiningSequencer`, `SeniorityFeedClient(PS06)`, `SequenceGrid` |
  | Backend Flow | On confirm: compute sequence within (office,designation,date) with deterministic ordering → persist → feed PS06 (outbox) |

  | Authorization | System assign; Authority resequence (P02) |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Sequence assigned; PS06 fed (outbox) |
  | Failure Handling | PS06 feed via outbox retry; uniqueness violation → recompute |

### FR-PS05-022 — Enterprise Quarters / Estate Retention & Licence-Fee Recovery
- **Module:** PS05 · Quarters / Estate
- **Primary Role(s):** Estate / Quarters Officer, HR Officer, Transfer Authority, Payroll Officer, Employee
- **User Story:** *As an estate officer, I want official-accommodation retention, vacation timelines, and licence-fee recovery modelled as a sub-process — not one checklist tick — so post-transfer accommodation is tracked and recovered statutorily.*
- **Description:** Models a `quarter_allotment` for transferees occupying official accommodation: retention-allowed flag (Authority-approved, P01/P02), `vacate_by_date`, vacation tracking, normal/penal `licence_fee_rate`, and a **licence-fee-recovery signal to PS10** (outbox) when accommodation is retained beyond entitlement. Linked to the `ESTATE_QUARTERS` clearance branch (FR-006) but richer: clearance can be `CLEARED_WITH_DUES` with an active retention rather than blocking relieving. Overstay flips penal rate via **`JOB-PS05-QTR-OVERSTAY`** (X.1).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A quarter retention record can be created/approved with `vacate_by_date` and licence-fee rate.
  2. Retention beyond permissible period flips `penal_rate_applies=true` and status `OVERSTAY` (`JOB-PS05-QTR-OVERSTAY`).
  3. An overstay/retention raises a **licence-fee-recovery signal to PS10** with reference (outbox).
  4. Vacation recording sets `VACATED` + `vacated_on`; closes the estate clearance dependency.
  5. The estate clearance branch does not hard-block relieving when retention is approved (recovery tracked separately).
- **Business Rules:** Retention requires Authority approval; penal rate per policy after permissible months; licence-fee recovery is a PS10 signal (recovery owned by PS10); vacation reconciles the estate clearance branch.
- **Data Model References:** `quarter_allotments`, `clearance_items` (ESTATE_QUARTERS), `sr_outbox` (PS10 licence-fee signal), `transfer_orders`.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Estate panel with retention request/approval, vacate-by countdown, penal-rate indicator, vacation recording; licence-fee recovery status; estate register.

## 7. UI Requirements

> Built on the platform **canonical UI-state standard** (Foundation §3: empty / loading / error / no-permission / partial-data), the **Workspace switcher** (Me / My Team / Admin, Platform §6.5), the shared **approval action bar** and component vocabulary (inline-edit, masked field per RBAC §3.9, multi-step wizard, list+filter+bulk toolbar, attachment `VAL-FILE`, comment `VAL-COMMENT`, effective-date picker, audit-trail panel). Visual styling is the design system's job.

### 7.1 Screens & layouts
| Screen | Workspace | Primary users | Key elements | States covered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transfer Request Wizard | Me / Admin | Employee, HR | Type selector (canonical taxonomy), details, grounds+docs (**sensitive uploads marked restricted**), eligibility banner, review | empty/loading/error/success/permission |

### 7.2 Cross-cutting UI rules
- Responsive breakpoints **375 / 768 / 1280 px**, touch targets ≥ 44×44 px; collapsible sidebar with menu icons + hamburger on small screens (per platform NFR §8.2).
- WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, focus order, ARIA labels, contrast ≥ 4.5:1.
- Dark mode via design tokens; no hardcoded colors.
- Every list **cursor-paginated** (default 25 / max 100) with empty/loading/error states; destructive/forced actions confirmed with typed reason (`ERR-REASON-REQ`).
- Real fields and live data only — no skeleton placeholders.
- Toasts for async results; inline validation with field-level error from the platform error envelope; copy referenced by `ERR-*`/`ERR-PS05-*` id, never inlined.
- Bilingual labels (English + regional) on statutory documents/orders (W.2 i18n).
- **Masked fields** (enterprise identifiers, financial) per RBAC §3.9 / P02 field-mask-on-serialization; `E·AR` fields use the **Request-change** control routing to a P01 flow, never a direct write.
- **Sensitive-ground documents render behind a restricted-access gate with a P05 access-logged "reveal" action**.
- **Pay language is always "continued", never "stopped"** in transfer flows.

## 8. API & Integration

### 8.1 Conventions (platform-adopted verbatim)
REST under **`/api/v1`**; **Bearer JWT** carrying the session's resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; **P02 `Authorization.check`** per request (endpoints never re-implement permission logic); **cursor pagination only** (`?limit=` default **25** / max **100** + `cursor=`, response `next_cursor`); **`Idempotency-Key`** header on workflow-initiating / external-signal POSTs (24h replay → original result); **`X-Correlation-Id`** on every request, echoed and written to every audit/log line; `?sort=field:asc|desc` + per-endpoint filters; effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` (staged via `JOB-PS05-EFFDATE`, not live); ISO-8601 UTC storage, `DD-MMM-YYYY` display. All `transfer_orders.status` mutations route through `TransferOrderStateService` (§16.6) which calls P01 + P05.

### 8.2 Error envelope & codes (platform 8-code table + `ERR-PS05-*` ids)
**Canonical envelope:** `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field", "details": {} } }` with the correlation id carried in the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header** (no body `requestId`). 2xx returns the resource payload.

**Standard platform codes (Foundation §1):**
| Code | HTTP | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 422 | input failed a `VAL-*` / `VAL-PS05-*` rule |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | no/invalid session |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | authenticated but not permitted (never leaks existence of out-of-scope records) |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | resource absent or out of scope |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | idempotency replay, duplicate workflow start, state conflict |
| `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | 412 | a required precondition is not met |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | rate limit exceeded |
| `INTERNAL` | 500 | unexpected server error (incl. mapped upstream failure) |

**PS05 module conditions mapped onto the platform codes (message id → HTTP code):**
| `ERR-PS05-*` id | Platform code (HTTP) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR-PS05-ACTIVE-TRANSFER` | `CONFLICT` (409) | Employee already has an active **substantive** order |
| `ERR-PS05-ELIGIBILITY-BLOCKED` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` (422) | Hard-block policy failure |
| `ERR-PS05-BAN-WINDOW` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` (422) | Transfer falls in a ban period |
| `ERR-PS05-CLEARANCE-INCOMPLETE` | `PRECONDITION_FAILED` (412) | Relieving attempted before clearance/deemed |
| `ERR-PS05-HANDOVER-DISPUTED` | `CONFLICT` (409) | Charge handover not accepted/under-protest |
| `ERR-PS05-NOT-IN-TRANSIT` | `CONFLICT` (409) | Joining before relief |
| `ERR-PS05-DEPUTATION-CAP` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` (422) | Extension beyond max tenure |
| `ERR-PS05-VACANCY-FULL` | `CONFLICT` (409) | Allotment/join to filled vacancy (incl. join-time re-check) |
| `ERR-PS05-DUAL-POSTING` | `CONFLICT` (409) | Dual/zero in-transit custody |
| `ERR-PS05-STAY-HOLD` | `CONFLICT` (409) | Forward transition blocked by active hold |

> **503 is dropped** (no 503 in the platform table). Upstream unavailability of PS01/PS06/PS09/PS10/PS12/PS13/Holiday-master is handled by **X.3 per-integration error mapping** → `INTERNAL (500)` / `ERR-LOADFAIL` for synchronous reads, and by **`sr_outbox` retry/dead-letter** for asynchronous signals — never a blocking 503. Shared `ERR-*` ids (`ERR-FORBIDDEN`, `ERR-LOADFAIL`, `ERR-PRECOND`, `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`, `ERR-REASON-REQ`) are reused from Foundation §5; `ERR-PS05-*` ids register against the Foundation message catalogue.

### 8.3 Integration points
| System | Direction | Mechanism | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PS01** Employee Master + org placement | Read/Write | PS01 service + outbox `POSTING_UPDATE` | Validate transferee; **PS01 owns org-placement update on join**; reverse on revoke/abandon |
| **PS06** Promotion/Seniority | Read/Trigger | read-through + outbox `SENIORITY_FEED` | Promotion-linked trigger; **sanctioned-strength & seniority read-through**; **joining-sequence consumer** |
| **PS09** Disciplinary | Signal | outbox `DISCIPLINARY_TRIGGER` | Abandonment disciplinary trigger |
| **PS10** Payroll | Signal | outbox (PS10 events) | **Pay-continuity** (not stop/start), **entitlement by transfer_type+ground**, LPC, dues recovery, **licence-fee recovery** |
| **PS12** Digital SR (on P05 substrate) | Write | `sr_outbox` → X.3 | SR events (order/relieve/join) with **continuity assertion** |
| **PS13** Documents | Read/Write | PS13 service + doc-generation | Order/clearance/handover/joining PDFs; **sensitive document class** for medical/spouse/compassionate |
| **Holiday & Region master** (Org Admin Master) | Read | master query | Regional working-day/holiday calendar for joining-time (no silent fallback) |
| **P01** WorkflowEngine | Read/Write | service contract | Approval routing, `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` clearance, SLA runtime |
| **P02** Authorization | Read | `Authorization.check` | Per-request authz + field masking |
| **P05** Audit | Write | DB-trigger | Immutable audit of every mutation |
| **X.1 / X.2 / X.3** | Read/Write | runner / notification / integration | Jobs, statutory notifications, outbound delivery |
| **PS14** Analytics | Read | `analytics.*` | Dashboards & reports |

**Holiday/Region master contract:** working-day count between two dates excluding regional holidays/weekends is read from the platform **Holiday & Region master** (`VAL-HOL-RECUR`/`VAL-REGION-STATE`); unavailability defers joining-time computation (FR-PS05-009), never silently defaulted.

**PS10 signal contract:** `PAY_CONTINUITY{employeeId, fromDate, custodyOrgUnit, continue:true}`, `ENTITLEMENT{employeeId, transferType, ground, distanceBand, joiningTimePayAdmissible}`, `LPC_REQUEST{...}`, `LICENCE_FEE_RECOVERY{employeeId, quarterRef, rate, penal}` — all idempotent via the outbox key, delivered on X.3.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements (platform NFR baseline)
| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Performance | Read p95 **< 500ms @ 300 concurrent**; write p95 **< 1500ms**; read-heavy/reports p95 < 300ms cached / < 1000ms uncached; dashboard aggregates < 2s; bulk drive of 1,000 orders < 30 min (async X.1); counselling turn record < 300ms; web LCP (4G) < 2.5s. |
| Availability | **99.5%/month uptime**; `sr_outbox` guarantees no data loss during PS10/PS12/PS01/PS09 downtime. |
| Scalability | Horizontal scaling; batch/counselling jobs queue-based (X.1); supports 100k active employees, 20k transfers/year. |
| Security | Bearer JWT + **MFA for high-privilege enterprise roles** (Transfer/Appointing/Disciplinary Authority); **P02** RBAC + row-level org scope; SoD by P01/P02; OWASP ASVS; parameterised queries only; secrets via `integration_credentials` (P04) / env, never hardcoded. |
| Data integrity | All multi-step writes transactional; external signals via `sr_outbox` (idempotency-key formula); no orphan records; gapless statutory numbering; single-custodian invariant; **`tenant_id`/`entity_id` data-layer scoping** (unscoped query rejected). |
| Auditability | **P05 DB-trigger** captures every mutation (100%, zero gaps) to `audit_log`; auth/RBAC events to `security_audit_log`; **forced actions, overrides, deemed-clearances, resequencing, and sensitive-document access carry dedicated reason+actor**; immutable PS12 SR events and counselling choice log; tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03**. |
| Privacy/Compliance | DPDP Act 2023 alignment; **medical/spouse/compassionate evidence classified as a DPDP sensitive document class in PS13 with restricted access and P05 access logging**; PII minimisation (PII Protection Ceiling, masked on serialization); **statutory retention ≥ 7 yr** (never below the statutory floor); no PII in logs. |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA across all screens; breakpoints 375/768/1280, touch ≥ 44×44. |
| Observability | Structured logs with `X-Correlation-Id`; metrics (clearance time, P01 SLA breaches, deemed-clearances, transit days, custody exceptions, outbox dead-letter rate, un-overridden violations); job-run audit rows (X.1). |
| Resilience | **RTO < 4h, RPO < 1h**; retries with backoff (X.1 ×3 within dispatch, outbox to `max_attempts`); dead-letter + reconciliation for outbox. |
| i18n/L10n | Bilingual order templates (W.2); regional working-day calendar (Holiday & Region master); locale dates/currency; timezone-aware display. |

### 9.x Privacy — sensitive-ground documents
Documents supporting `MEDICAL`/`SPOUSE`/`COMPASSIONATE` grounds (`sensitive_document_ids`, `sensitive_ground=true`) are stored in **PS13 under a statutory sensitive document class**: access restricted to the transferee, the deciding Transfer Authority, and HR officers with an explicit need (P02 field/data scope); **every read is access-logged (P05) with actor + correlation id**; such documents are excluded from general analytics (PS14) and never rendered in non-restricted UI contexts. Right-to-erasure applies only to non-statutory data; statutory transfer data has mandated retention with a redaction marker the only audit overwrite path.

## 10. Workflow & State Diagrams (state tables)

> All approval gating runs on **P01**; `transfer_orders.status` transitions are executed by `TransferOrderStateService` (which calls P01 + writes via the P05 trigger). The clearance checklist is a **P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` instance**; its SLA/escalation is the P01 SLA runtime.

Notification preferences are user-configurable (P02 Settings); statutory notifications cannot be opted out. Job terminal failures alert via `MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL`.

### 11.1 Scheduled jobs index (`JOB-PS05-*`, registered on the X.1 runner; Foundation §4)
> Each job inherits the X.1 shared runner standard: idempotent (per-period run key), retry exponential backoff ×3, terminal failure → `JOB-FAIL` → `MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL`, per-tenant isolation, run-audit row. Cadence/logic here; index in Foundation §4. In-workflow SLAs (clearance/handover) are the **P01 SLA runtime**, not jobs.

| Job id | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `JOB-PS05-EFFDATE` | Apply effective-dated statutory dates (transfer w.e.f., LWD, joining date) due today |
| `JOB-PS05-OUTBOX` | Dispatch `sr_outbox` rows to PS12/PS10/PS01/PS09/PS06 via X.3; backoff; dead-letter |

| `JOB-PS05-COUNSEL-TIMEOUT` | Counselling turn timeout → `AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT` |
| `JOB-PS05-QTR-OVERSTAY` | Quarter overstay detection → penal-rate flip + PS10 signal |
| `JOB-PS05-REPAT-REMIND` | Repatriation-due reminders ahead of `current_end_date` |
| `JOB-PS05-GAPAUDIT` | Gapless number-sequence gap audit (zero unexplained gaps) |
| `JOB-PS05-SERVE-DEEM` | Deemed-served processing (non-ack window / returned post) |
| `JOB-PS05-DRIVE` | Bulk-drive batch order generation (resumable) |
| `JOB-PS05-STRENGTH-RECON` | Refresh `vacancy_positions` strength read-through caches from PS06/PS01 |
| `JOB-PS05-SR-RECON` | SR/outbox reconciliation report (missing/failed/dead-lettered) |

## 13. Migration & Launch (on P06)

### 13.1 Data migration (P06 ETL+V)
- Run on the **P06 Migration Toolkit** (Extract → Validate → Transform → Load → Verify, idempotent; **three mandatory staging dry runs**; waves; `migration_runs` ledger; failed records logged with source row + violated rule).
- Every migrated PS05 row carries a permanent **`ps05_source_id`** traceability/dedup column (the `darwinbox_source_id` pattern against the **actual enterprise legacy register**, `GAP (enterprise-specific)` — source system differs).
- Import historical transfer/relieving/joining records into `transfer_orders`/`relieving_orders`/`joining_reports`; statuses normalised to terminal (`JOINED`/`CANCELLED`).
- Backfill in-flight transfers into the correct live state (relieved-but-not-joined → `IN_TRANSIT`) **and assign an in-transit custodian**.
- **Backfill `served_on_date` from the legacy register; where unknown, mark `DEEMED_SERVED` with a migration reason**.
- Seed `transfer_policy_rules` (incl. `JOINING_TIME_PAY`), `transfer_ban_periods`, office clearance-department configs (→ P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` branch sets), **clearance SLAs (P01 SLA settings), joining-time distance bands**, order templates (W.2), and **`order_number_sequences` initialised to the legacy high-water mark per office/year (no gaps)**.
- Reconcile legacy SR entries with **PS12** via `sr_outbox` reversal events (`*_CANCELLED`, `is_reversal=true` → `/sr/ingest/reversal`); no duplicates (dedup tuple `(source_module, source_reference_id, source_event_version)`).

### 13.2 Cutover & launch
- Dual-run period: legacy + HRMS for one transfer cycle; reconcile counts and **custody/continuity invariants**.
- Phased rollout: pilot offices → cadre-wise → org-wide; bulk-drive & counselling features enabled after pilot sign-off.
- Go/No-Go gates: SR/outbox health ≥ 99.5% in pilot; **zero custody-integrity and zero un-overridden-violation exceptions**; UAT sign-off by Transfer Authority + SR Custodian.
- Rollback: feature-flag disable of write paths; **outbox drains before cutover**; backups verified (**RPO < 1h**).

### 13.3 Training & support
- Role-based guides (employee self-service, clearance/estate officer, HR, authority, presiding officer).
- In-app contextual help (P03 chat grounded on uploaded transfer-policy documents); SR/outbox reconciliation runbook; **forced-action & hold runbook for Authorities**.

### 14.2 Dependency / build order
1. **Foundation:** entity migrations (P06) with `tenant_id`/`entity_id`/`ps05_source_id`; policy/ban/SLA/distance-band seed; **`order_number_sequences` seed**; order templates (W.2); **Holiday/Region master** wired; **W.1 approval-flow definitions** (order approval; clearance `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`) configured.
2. **FR-PS05-012** (`sr_outbox` on X.1/X.3 — frozen contract) — prerequisite for all side effects.
3. **FR-PS05-002** (eligibility, strength read-through) — prerequisite for 001/003/004.
4. **FR-PS05-001** (request intake W.2, sensitive docs PS13).
5. **FR-PS05-004** (orders, gapless numbering, P01 approval) + **FR-PS05-020** (proof-of-service) → **FR-PS05-006** (clearance `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` + P01 SLA), **FR-PS05-007** (handover), **FR-PS05-016** (forced actions on P01).
6. **FR-PS05-008** (relieving + pay-continuity) + **FR-PS05-015** (service continuity & custody) → **FR-PS05-009** (transit, calendar) → **FR-PS05-010** (joining, PS01 posting) + **FR-PS05-021** (joining-sequence → PS06) + **FR-PS05-018** (abandonment → PS09).
7. **FR-PS05-017** (representation/stay-hold) — **baseline**, layered across order lifecycle.
8. **FR-PS05-003/005/019** (counselling/drives) on 002/004.
9. **FR-PS05-011** (deputation), **FR-PS05-022** (estate), **FR-PS05-013** (corrections), **FR-PS05-014 analytics** (PS14 baseline) — **map view deferred to Phase-2**.

### 14.3 Parallel-agent plan (single state-service owner)
| Agent | Owns FRs | Shared contracts to honour |
|---|---|---|
| Agent A (Intake & Policy) | FR-PS05-001, 002 | request/eligibility API + canonical enums; W.2 form; strength read-through client (PS06) |
| Agent B (Orders, Numbering, Service, Drives, Counselling) | FR-PS05-003, 004, 005, 019, 020 | order entity, **`order_number_sequences`**, `order_acknowledgements`, `vacancy_reservations`, `sr_outbox` writer; P01 W.1 approval flow |
| Agent C (Relieving, Clearance, Handover, Forced-Action) | FR-PS05-006, 007, 008, 016, 022 | clearance **`PARALLEL_ALL_OF`** flow + P01 SLA, handover/relieving/quarter entities, PS10 signal client (**consumes `TransferOrderStateService`, does not write status**) |
| Agent D (Transit, Joining, Continuity, Sequence, Abandonment) | FR-PS05-009, 010, 015, 018, 021 | PS01 client (posting update), PS10 pay-continuity, Holiday/Region master client, PS06 seniority feed (**consumes `TransferOrderStateService`**) |
| Agent E (SR/Outbox, Deputation, Corrections, Representation, Analytics) | FR-PS05-011, 012, 013, 017, 014 | `sr_outbox` (X.1/X.3), reversal orchestrator, representation/hold (P01), PS14 read models |
| **Shared service (owned by Agent B, consumed by C/D/E)** | **`TransferOrderStateService`** | **Sole writer of `transfer_orders.status`** — calls **P01** for gating + **P05** for audit; eliminates multi-writer conflict |

Shared interface contracts (entities §5, error codes §8.2, state tables §10, `sr_outbox` §5.2.15, `TransferOrderStateService` §16.6, platform service contracts P01/P02/P05) are frozen before parallel work.

## 15. Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Transfer order | Sanctioned, numbered (gapless) statutory document moving an employee from source to destination office. |
| Order class | Classification of an order: `SUBSTANTIVE`, `ADDITIONAL_CHARGE`, `DEPUTATION`, `REPATRIATION`; only one substantive transition may be active per employee. |
| Proof-of-service | Recorded service of the order on the employee (channel + date) on which relieve-by deadlines rest. |
| Relieving | Formal release of an employee from the source office after clearance and handover (or deemed action). |
| No-dues / clearance | Departmental certification (configured departments, run as a **P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`** flow) that no dues/assets are outstanding; may be cleared, with-dues, waived, or deemed-cleared. |
| Deemed clearance | Authority-granted clearance after P01 SLA + escalation when an officer is non-responsive. |
| Charge handover/assumption | Transfer of duties, records, assets and cash from relinquishing to receiving officer; may be under protest. |
| Last Working Day (LWD) | Final day of duty at source; basis for transit computation (pay is continued, not stopped). |
| Forenoon / Afternoon (FN/AN) relieving | Whether the day counts as source duty or transit — load-bearing for pay and seniority (§16.9). |
| In-transit custody | The single office owning pay/attendance/headcount/discipline of an employee during `IN_TRANSIT`. |
| Service continuity | Treatment of the transit/joining-time period as continuous paid service with no break in qualifying service. |
| Joining time | Statutorily admissible working days (by distance band, Holiday/Region master) allowed to travel and join — paid. |
| Joining report | Document by which a transferee reports and assumes duty at destination, fixing the joining date. |
| Joining sequence | Inter-se order among same-cadre/post joiners on a date; sets seniority consumed by PS06. |
| Representation / stay-order / retention hold | A filing that pauses an order (`STAY_HOLD`) pre-join. |
| Abandonment | Non-joining beyond grace; breaks continuity and triggers PS09. |
| Transit period | Time between LWD and joining date; bounded by admissible joining time; paid. |
| Mutual transfer | Reciprocal exchange of two employees; coupled through approval, relieving and joining. |
| Deputation / Repatriation | Temporary posting to a borrowing org with defined tenure / return to lending org. |
| Ban/freeze period (MCC) | Window (e.g. election Model Code of Conduct) during which transfers are restricted. |
| Sanctioned strength | Authorised number of posts (owned by PS06/PS01; read-through by PS05). |
| LPC | Last Pay Certificate issued by source payroll (PS10) on relieving. |
| Imprest / DDO charge | Standing cash advance held by an officer / Drawing-and-Disbursing-Officer responsibilities handed over. |
| Licence fee | Rent for official accommodation; penal rate applies on overstay. |
| SR event | Append-only entry in the Digital Service Register (**PS12**, on the P05 substrate), posted via `sr_outbox`. |
| Outbox | Transactional outbox (PS04-style) guaranteeing idempotent external-signal delivery (SR/PS10/PS01/PS09/PS06), dispatched on X.1/X.3. |
| Counselling | Preference- or live-session-based allotment in a transfer drive. |
| Cadre / Officiating | Service group/stream / holding a higher post on an acting basis. |
| P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3 | PrimeSoft platform services (workflow, RBAC, chat, tenant/org admin, audit, migration; jobs, notifications, integration; configured flows/forms/notification config) consumed by id. |

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Sequence (happy path, narrative)
Request (W.2) → eligibility pass (strength read-through from PS06) → recommend → Authority approve (P01) → **reserve-then-commit gapless order_no** + PDF (PS13) → publish (SR `TRANSFER` via `/sr/ingest`→PS12, clearance `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` instance created) → **serve order on employee + acknowledgement (X.2)** → departments clear in parallel (P01 SLA-bounded; deemed if needed) → handover accepted (or under-protest) → relieving order + LWD (**pay-continuity** + LPC to PS10, SR `RELIEVING` asserting no break, **custodian set**, reservation vacated) → IN_TRANSIT (paid joining-time clock, Holiday/Region master) → report at destination → charge assumption → confirm joining (**reservation re-check + fill**, pay-continuity resumes, **PS01 posting update**, **joining-sequence assigned → PS06**, SR `JOINING`) — with representation/stay-holds and abandonment (→ PS09) as first-class branches. Every mutation captured by the **P05 trigger**.

### 16.2 Office clearance-department default config
IT, LIBRARY, ACCOUNTS, STORES, ADVANCES, ESTATE_QUARTERS, HR — **configurable per office; an office may configure fewer** (only configured departments generate `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` branches; zero departments → checklist auto-CLEARED); an office may add `OTHER` named departments. Each configured department is one branch of the P01 clearance flow with its own SLA setting.

### 16.3 Outbox & idempotency note
External signals (PS10 pay-continuity/entitlement/LPC/licence-fee, PS12 SR, PS01 posting, PS09 trigger, PS06 seniority feed) are written to `sr_outbox` (§5.2.15) in the same DB transaction as the local state change and dispatched asynchronously by **`JOB-PS05-OUTBOX` (X.1)** via **X.3**. **Idempotency key formula:** `{target_system}:{event_type}:{aggregate_type}:{aggregate_id}:{revision_no}`. Backoff is exponential to `max_attempts` (default 8); exhausted rows are `DEAD_LETTERED` (retained ≥ 180 days) and surfaced in the SR Reconciliation Console (FR-PS05-012).

### 16.4 Joining-time by distance band
Joining time is computed from `joining_distance_band` against the platform **Holiday & Region master** (regional working days), not a flat `joining_time_days`. Seeded defaults (System-Administrator/Org-Admin-configurable):
| Band | Indicative distance | Default joining time (working days) |
|---|---|---|
| LOCAL | same station | 0 |
| SHORT | < 200 km | 3 |
| MEDIUM | 200–500 km | 5 |
| LONG | 500–1000 km | 7 |
| OUTSTATION | > 1000 km / external | 10 + travel |

### 16.5 Open configuration parameters & module-unique ids
Minimum-tenure months, near-retirement window, cooling period, **joining-time distance bands**, **clearance SLA hours + escalation tiers per department (P01 SLA settings)**, **dispute-resolution SLA**, **deemed-action policy**, deputation max tenure, drive preference window, **counselling turn timeout**, **order-number prefix templates per office**, **licence-fee normal/penal rates & permissible retention months**, **late-joining grace** — all configurable via the versioned config cascade (Platform §0.3), seeded defaults.

**Module-unique ids authored by PS05 and registered in the Foundation indexes:** `VAL-PS05-ELIG`, `VAL-PS05-TRANSFER-ORDER`, `VAL-PS05-JTIME`, `VAL-PS05-SREVENT`, `VAL-PS05-SENIORITY` (Foundation §2); `JOB-PS05-*` (Foundation §4, §11.1 above); `MSG-PS05-*`, `ERR-PS05-*` (Foundation §5, §8.2/§11 above). All other validations cite Foundation `VAL-*` ids; all standard errors use the platform 8-code table.

### 16.6 `TransferOrderStateService` contract
The **sole writer** of `transfer_orders.status`. Exposes guarded transition methods (`approve`, `publish`, `serve`, `hold`, `vacateHold`, `startRelieving`, `relieve`, `enterTransit`, `confirmJoining`, `revertToSource`, `abandon`, `amend`, `cancel`, `revoke`), each (a) validating the §10.1 guards (incl. hold supremacy 5.6-16, served precedence 5.6-15, custody 5.6-12, mutual coupling 5.6-5), (b) **invoking P01** for approval-gated transitions (`approve`/`publish`/`relieve`/`confirmJoining`/`revertToSource`/`abandon`/`amend`/`cancel`/`revoke`), and (c) writing the row so the **P05 DB-trigger** captures the change. Agents C/D/E consume it; none writes the column directly — eliminating the multi-writer conflict. It is an **orchestration service over P01/P05**, not a parallel workflow engine.

### 16.7 Gapless statutory numbering
Numbers are issued via **reserve-then-commit** on `order_number_sequences` (row-locked per `scope`/`office`/`fiscal_year`): (1) reserve `next_value` inside the order transaction; (2) on successful PS13 PDF render + commit, advance `next_value`; (3) on failure, the reserved value is **voided with an explicit audit row** (P05) so `JOB-PS05-GAPAUDIT` shows zero unexplained gaps. Never "retry sequence on collision"; contention surfaces as `409`/`ERR-PS05-NUMBER-LOCKED` (retry).

### 16.8 Acceptance tests for invariants
| AT | Invariant | Oracle |
|---|---|---|
| AT-PAY-CONTINUITY | Relieve→join produces **no pay gap** | PS10 receives one `PAY_CONTINUITY` (no `PAY_STOP`); no unpaid interval between LWD and joining_date |
| AT-CUSTODY | No dual/zero posting | While `IN_TRANSIT`, exactly one `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id`; headcount counts once; null/two → `ERR-PS05-DUAL-POSTING` |
| AT-ENTITLEMENT | Entitlement keyed by type+ground | Own-request vs administrative produce different `ENTITLEMENT` payloads |
| AT-DEEMED-CLEAR | Forced-action audit | `DEEMED_CLEARED` requires P01 SLA+escalation exhausted, reason+actor captured by P05, queryable |
| AT-DEEMED-RELIEF | Deemed-relief unblocks | Relieving issuable with `deemed_relief=true` + reason; precondition 5.6-2 satisfied |
| AT-MUTUAL | Mutual coupling | Asymmetric completion blocked (`ERR-PS05-MUTUAL-PAIR`) at relieve/join |
| AT-SERVED | Served-date precedence | Relieving blocked without service (`ERR-PS05-NOT-SERVED`); relieve_by from served date |
| AT-GAPLESS | Gapless numbering under concurrency | 1000 concurrent orders → contiguous numbers, zero gaps/dups; voided reservations audited |
| AT-VACANCY | Join-time re-check | Cascading-vacancy double-fill blocked at join (`ERR-PS05-VACANCY-FULL`) |
| AT-HOLD | Hold supremacy | Active `STAY_HOLD` blocks all forward transitions (`ERR-PS05-STAY-HOLD`) |
| AT-ABANDON | Continuity break recorded | `ABANDONED` sets `service_continuity_asserted=false` + PS09 trigger + defined pay status |
| AT-SEQUENCE | Inter-se determinism | Same-date same-post joiners get distinct contiguous sequence by reported_date→FN/AN→service_no; fed to PS06 |
| AT-OVERRIDE | Un-overridden-violation KPI | Valid overrides NOT flagged as violations; un-overridden violations = 0 |
| AT-COUNSELLING | Single live turn | Out-of-turn choice → `ERR-PS05-COUNSEL-TURN`; choice log immutable (P05) |
| AT-SENSITIVE | Sensitive-doc access logging | Every read of a PS13 sensitive-class document writes a P05 access-log row |
| AT-OUTBOX | Idempotent delivery | Duplicate dispatch deduped by key; dead-letter after max_attempts; reconciliation surfaces it |
| AT-LICENCE-FEE | Estate recovery | Overstay flips penal rate + emits `LICENCE_FEE_RECOVERY` to PS10 |
| AT-PLATFORM-TENANT | Tenant isolation | A query without a resolvable tenant scope is rejected, not defaulted to "all" (Platform §0.1) |
| AT-PLATFORM-AUDIT | P05 capture | Every PS05 mutation produces exactly one immutable `audit_log` row via DB-trigger (no API bypass) |
| AT-PLATFORM-SR | SR on PS12 | SR events land in the **PS12** ledger (P05 substrate), not a local table; PS05 holds no SR rows of its own |

### 16.9 Domain Primer
For implementers without Indian enterprise HR background:
- **LPC (Last Pay Certificate):** statement from source payroll certifying pay drawn up to LWD; the destination needs it to start/continue salary correctly. PS05 *requests* it; PS10 *issues* it.
- **No-dues / clearance:** each department (IT, Library, Accounts, Stores, Advances, Estate) certifies the employee owes nothing (no unreturned laptop, books, advances, stores, accommodation). Required before relieving — modelled as a **P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`** flow (all branches must clear).
- **Imprest / DDO charge:** an **imprest** is a standing petty-cash advance an officer holds; a **DDO (Drawing & Disbursing Officer)** is responsible for drawing and disbursing enterprise money. On transfer these must be reconciled and handed over.
- **MCC (Model Code of Conduct):** during elections, a ban window freezes transfers (a `transfer_ban_period`).
- **Cadre:** a defined service group/stream (e.g. Teaching, Ministerial); transfer drives are run cadre-wise.
- **Officiating:** holding a higher post on an acting basis pending regular promotion.
- **Forenoon / Afternoon (FN/AN) relieving — *why it matters*:** an employee relieved in the **forenoon** is treated as **not on duty at source that day** (the day counts toward transit), whereas **afternoon** relieving counts the day as **source duty**. This one bit shifts the LWD/transit boundary, which affects **pay** (which office pays that day) and **seniority/joining-time** computation. It is load-bearing, not cosmetic — hence an explicit enum and acceptance coverage.
- **Deputation / Repatriation:** lending an employee to a borrowing organisation for a fixed tenure (deputation) and bringing them back (repatriation); modelled as co-existing `DEPUTATION`/`REPATRIATION` order classes.
- **Transit / joining time:** the paid period to travel and join; not unpaid dead time (a core correction preserved from v2).
- **Digital SR (PS12):** the statutory Service Register — a net-new append-only enterprise ledger running on the platform **P05** audit/immutability substrate. PS05 is a **writer** to it (via the outbox), never its owner.
