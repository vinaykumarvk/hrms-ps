# PS03 Reconciliation — PrimeSoft PROTOTYPE screens vs schema

**Owned schema:** `docs/data-model/03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql`
**Ground truth:** `docs/data-model/reconciliation/prototype-extract/*.txt` (leave & attendance screens)
**Companion pass:** `docs/data-model/reconciliation/ps03-leave-attendance.md` (CSV/vendor-config pass — already added
`attendance_policies`, `overtime_policies`, `attendance_networks`, `geofences` and many leave/shift/holiday columns).
**Date:** 2026-07-01

## Method & the data-vs-config rule

The prototype extracts are UI field/label dumps from the PrimeSoft M04/M05 screens. As in the CSV pass, a label was
promoted to a real schema column/table only when it is a **genuine, queryable DATA attribute** (a leave-application
field, an OT-request field, a revocation/adjustment request, a holiday attribute, a device modality, a physical fence
address). Screen-level **module behaviour toggles** (`leave-config`, `attendance-config`, request-window / display /
auto-route switches) are POLICY/UI CONFIG and route to the existing `module_config` table or per-policy `*_config jsonb`
columns — they are NOT first-class columns. Manager/team roll-up screens (`team-leave`, `team-attendance`,
`office-attendance`) are **derived reads** of existing tables and add no storage.

One judgement differs from the CSV pass: `leave-reasons` and `attendance-reasons` are shown in the prototype as
**dedicated admin CRUD masters** with structured attributes (code, category, doc-required, auto-route, auto-approve
threshold, frequency cap, applicable scope, effective-from, status). Per CONVENTIONS §4 a tenant-configurable value set
with those attributes is a **master table**, not a free-text + config allowed-list. The CSV pass deferred them ("no FK
consumers"); the prototype supplies the missing structure, so they are **promoted to tables this pass**.

Status: **PRESENT** already modelled · **PARTIAL** partly modelled / needed a column · **MISSING** no home before this pass.

## Counts (field-group granularity)

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| **PRESENT** (already modelled, incl. derived) | 29 |
| **PARTIAL** (partly modelled / needed a column or config split) | 9 |
| **MISSING** (no home before this prototype pass) | 15 |

The MISSING/PARTIAL items resolve to **5 new DATA tables**, **13 new DATA columns**, and the remaining
behaviour/display switches routed to `module_config` / `*_config jsonb` (note-as-config).

## Schema changes applied (03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql, SECTION 13c, ADD-ONLY)

**5 new tables:** `leave_reasons`, `attendance_reasons` (tenant-configurable reason masters, CONVENTIONS §4),
`leave_balance_adjustments` (FR-M04-021 adjustment request → ledger), `leave_revocations` (FR-M04-005 post-approval
revocation), `attendance_lock_periods` (FR-M05-007 monthly lock cycle). Each: RLS + indexes + 2-3 sample rows.

**8 new enums:** `ps03_shift_type`, `ps03_leave_adjustment_type`, `ps03_adjustment_status`, `ps03_revocation_type`,
`ps03_lock_resolution_mode`, `ps03_lock_status`, `ps03_biometric_modality`, `ps03_holiday_category`.

**13 new DATA columns on existing tables:**
- `leave_applications`: approver_note, hourly_minutes (2)
- `overtime_records`: reason, worked_on_holiday, worked_on_weekly_off (3)
- `shifts`: shift_type (1)
- `holidays`: holiday_category, description (2)
- `geofences`: address, max_employees (2)
- `attendance_devices`: biometric_modality (1)
- `attendance_policies`: wfh_cap_per_month, working_days_per_week, daily_required_minutes (3)

**Validation:** `00-platform-core.sql` + amended `03-PS03` load clean into a throwaway PostgreSQL 14 DB
(`psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`). No existing content changed; every change is additive.
