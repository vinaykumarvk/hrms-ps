# PH-11 UAT Execution Journal

Marker: `UAT_EXECUTION_REHEARSAL`

PH-11 converts the PH-10 UAT scripts into an execution journal for non-production rehearsal. This document is not business UAT sign-off. Business acceptance remains `UAT_SIGNOFF_HUMAN_REQUIRED`, and production release remains `GO_LIVE_HUMAN_APPROVAL_PENDING`.

## Rehearsal Scope

The rehearsal covers the four PH-10 UAT scripts: Executive Analytics, Compensation Readiness, Migration and Coexistence, and Release Controls. Each script is run against local or controlled non-production evidence only. The result records whether the script is executable, whether expected markers are present, and whether the business owner still needs to approve the final outcome.

| Script | Rehearsal result | Evidence | Owner | Target date | Sign-off state |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Executive Analytics | PASS for rehearsal evidence | PS14 dashboard markers `PS14_READ_ONLY`, `MART_REFRESH_IDEMPOTENT`, `P02_SCOPE_FILTER`, `DRILL_THROUGH_AUTHZ` verified by PH-10 checks | analytics-owner | 2026-07-17 | `BUSINESS_OWNER_PENDING` |
| Compensation Readiness | PASS for rehearsal evidence | PS10/PS11 readiness markers `RULE_VERSION_SNAPSHOT`, `PAYROLL_TRACE`, `SR_VERIFICATION_GATE`, `PENSION_CALC_TRACE` retained in release pack | compensation-lead | 2026-07-17 | `BUSINESS_OWNER_PENDING` |
| Migration and Coexistence | PASS for rehearsal evidence | `MIGRATION_DRY_RUN`, `RECONCILIATION_CERTIFIED`, and `MIGRATION_EXCEPTION_OWNERS` are present; unresolved exceptions stay pending | migration-lead | 2026-07-17 | `BUSINESS_OWNER_PENDING` |
| Release Controls | PASS for rehearsal evidence | Deployment, rollback, coexistence, and release evidence include `RISK_OWNER_DATE` and human approval markers | release-lead | 2026-07-17 | `BUSINESS_OWNER_PENDING` |

## Execution Notes

- The rehearsal proves the scripts are executable and evidence-backed; it does not certify production acceptance.
- The UAT room must still capture screenshots, signed minutes, defect dispositions, and business acceptance during the formal session.
- No production credentials, production URLs, or live integration endpoints were used for PH-11 evidence.
- Any open question from the rehearsal is entered in `docs/release/uat-defect-triage.md` before the release board review.
- The final release board packet must preserve `UAT_SIGNOFF_HUMAN_REQUIRED` until the business owner signs.
