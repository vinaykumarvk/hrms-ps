## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Payroll and Benefits Management module (**M10-PAY**) is the financial heart of the HRMS. It computes, controls, and disburses employee compensation each pay cycle; administers statutory deductions, loans, advances, perquisites, and benefits; **tracks every statutory deduction through to its actual deposit with the State (challan/CIN) and its posting to the books**; and produces every downstream financial and compliance artefact (payslips, bank disbursement files, statutory remittance schedules, Form-16/Form-24Q/tax statements, payroll registers, cost-to-organisation analytics, and full-and-final settlements). It publishes pay events to the **Digital Service Register (M12)** and feeds terminal-benefit and pension processing in **M11**.

M10 is engineered as a **configurable, rule-driven, audit-grade payroll *system of record*** — not merely a calculator. Pay is never hand-keyed into a ledger; it is *derived* from a versioned salary structure, a **point-in-time cross-module snapshot** of upstream facts (M01 master/bank/PAN/scheme, M03 attendance, M06 fixation, M09 recovery, org unit), and a deterministic computation pipeline. Once a payroll run is **finalised and locked, it is immutable** — corrections flow only through arrears, supplementary, off-cycle, or reopen-with-versioning runs, never through silent edits. Every rupee is traceable from snapshotted input → computed payslip → disbursed credit → **deposited statutory remittance → posted GL journal**, and is reversible only through a controlled adjustment with full audit.

The boundary of M10 is, per the Council's chairman ruling, **"compute + disburse + remit-to-State + post-to-GL-status"** — surgically wider than a calculator (it proves money was correctly *paid*, *remitted*, and *booked*, through to every employee's *exit*) but stopping short of becoming a general ledger.

### 1.2 Business Context and Problem Statement

Enterprise payroll combines high volume with extreme regulatory sensitivity: pay matrices and scales (e.g., 7th CPC-style pay levels), Dearness Allowance (DA) revisions issued retrospectively, House Rent Allowance (HRA) by city class, GPF/CPF/NPS contributions, income-tax (TDS) with employee declarations, proofs, perquisites, surcharge/cess/relief, professional tax slabs **that differ by state of posting**, recoveries ordered by disciplinary authorities, statutory remittances under tight deadlines **that must be deposited and matched, not merely scheduled**, and full-and-final settlements for every separation. Manual or spreadsheet-driven payroll produces reconciliation gaps, over/under-payments, **duplicate disbursements**, YTD drift, audit findings, and litigation. M10 eliminates these by making the rule set explicit and versioned, the run reproducible from a defined snapshot, the disbursement double-payment-proof, the YTD an immutable derived ledger, and the controls enforceable.

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives

| # | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Deterministic, reproducible monthly payroll | Re-running an unlocked cycle with identical inputs **and the same cross-module snapshot** yields byte-identical results |
| G2 | Statutory accuracy **through deposit** | 100% correct DA/HRA/PT/TDS/GPF/NPS/perquisite computation against published rules; zero statutory-deadline misses **proven against actual challan/CIN deposit, not just schedule generation** |
| G3 | Immutable, auditable finalised runs | No mutation of locked runs; every adjustment traceable to an arrear/supplementary/off-cycle/reopen-version entry with a lock-to-lock diff |
| G4 | Reconciliation integrity (extended) | Gross = sum(earnings); Net = Gross − sum(deductions); **Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net** — reconciled before disbursement; YTD ties to the immutable line ledger |
| G5 | Self-service | Employees access payslips, tax declarations, Form-16, loan statements, FnF status without HR intervention |
| G6 | Retrospective correctness | Arrears for back-dated DA/increment/pay-fixation computed automatically with full break-up and **dependent-allowance cascade**, with cross-FY relief via Form-10E |
| G7 | Cost transparency | Cost-to-organisation analytics by org unit, cadre, component, and period, including employer cost |
| G8 | No duplicate / no missing money | No double disbursement on resend (positive-pay guard); no net pay leaves the tie-out silently (suspense ledger) |
| G9 | Lifecycle completeness | Every employee's exit is settled through a single consolidated full-and-final run |

### 1.4 Scope Summary

In scope: salary structure & pay rules engine (constrained, versioned DSL); monthly payroll run engine with parallel/what-if runs and a **single-in-flight-run guarantee**; **cross-module point-in-time snapshot contract**; arrears & retrospective revisions with dependent-allowance cascade; supplementary & off-cycle payroll; LWP/leave-based deductions; subsistence-allowance and dies-non handling; statutory deductions (TDS, PT-by-state, GPF/PF, NPS, pension contribution, insurance); **taxable perquisite valuation (Rule 3, incl. concessional-loan perquisite)**; full TDS pipeline (standard deduction → Chapter VI-A → slab → surcharge with marginal relief → 4% cess → 87A rebate → 89(1)/Form-10E relief → previous-employer/Form-12B income); recoveries with legal-eligibility check; loans & advances; benefits administration incl. **leave encashment**; payslip generation **with reopen versioning**; bank disbursement with **DSC/HSM signature, bank-side batch reference, positive-pay reconciliation, and a suspense-hold ledger**; payroll register & reconciliation; **statutory remittance & liability tracking (deducted → deposited → matched) and GL cost-journal posting status**; Form-16/Form-24Q/tax statements; full-and-final settlement; approval, locking & reopen-versioning; feeds to M11 and M12.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): the canonical employee master (M01), attendance/leave capture (M03), pension disbursement after retirement (M11), the SR ledger itself (M12), document storage internals (M13), and the **general-ledger book of record** (M10 produces the cost journal and tracks its posting status; Finance's ERP owns the GL).

### 1.5 Key Stakeholders

Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager/Controller, HR Officer/Admin, Department Head/Drawing & Disbursing Officer (DDO), Finance/Treasury, Employee (self-service), Auditor, System Administrator.

### 1.6 Success Criteria

A pay cycle is "successful" when: all eligible active employees are computed from a frozen cross-module snapshot; reconciliation balances to zero variance with `disbursed + held + failed = run net`; the run is approved and locked; payslips are published; the bank file is DSC-signed, transmitted once with a unique bank batch reference, and positively reconciled against the treasury debit; statutory schedules are produced **and their remittances deposited, challan-captured, and matched**; the cost journal is exported and its posting acknowledged; and pay events are posted to M12 — all within the cycle calendar with a complete audit trail. A separation is "successful" when the employee's full-and-final settlement nets all dues and recoveries into a single final payment with its own reconciliation and M11 handoff.

## 1A. Amendments (v1 → v2)

This table maps every Council **Adopted Improvement** (AI-1…AI-24) and **Risk** (R1…R19) to where and how it is incorporated.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from Shared Foundation)

All M10 features inherit: UUID PKs + human business keys; standard audit fields; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE status enums; UTC storage / locale display; `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates; INR default currency with i18n money formatting; paginated list endpoints (max page 100); maker-checker via the shared workflow engine; RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; immutable `audit_log` write on every state change; `documents` (M13) for generated artefacts; `notifications` for events; `service_register_events` (M12) for pay events.

### 2.3 In-Scope / Out-of-Scope Boundary Table

| Concern | In M10? | Owner / Note |
|---|---|---|
| Employee master data | Reference only (**snapshotted as-of cutoff**) | M01 (golden source) |
| Attendance & leave balances | Consume only (**snapshotted**) | M03 (LWP days, paid/unpaid splits) |
| Promotion / pay-fixation order | Consume the order; compute pay impact | M06 issues; M10 fixes pay & computes arrears |
| Disciplinary recovery order | Consume; recover via payroll | M09 issues; M10 schedules recovery |
| Pension disbursement | Out | M11 (M10 supplies last-pay-drawn, contribution history, **FnF gratuity handoff**) |
| Service register pay events | Write events | M12 owns ledger; M10 appends |
| Document storage | Reference | M13 stores payslips/Form-16/bank files |
| Statutory deposit (challan/CIN) | **In — tracked to MATCHED** | M10 records deposit & matches; the banking/TRACES portal executes |
| General ledger posting | **Export + posting-status tracking** (amended from "export only") | M10 produces cost journal and tracks `POSTED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED`; Finance ERP owns the GL book of record |
| Bank core integration | File + API handshake (**DSC-signed, positive-pay reconciled**) | Treasury/Bank gateway is external |

### 2.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- Pay scales, DA rates, HRA city classes, **PT slabs keyed by state**, and tax slabs are **configurable master data**, sourced from enterprise notifications and version-effective-dated.
- A single legal entity per deployment; multi-entity is a future extension but the data model is entity-aware (`legal_entity_id`). **Multi-state professional tax is supported within a single entity via a `state` dimension on PT slabs.**
- One primary monthly cycle plus arrears/supplementary/off-cycle/**FnF** cycles per period.
- The bank/treasury accepts **one defined, certified file format per deployment** (the treasury's format is shipped; ISO20022/CUSTOM are deferred behind a strategy seam). The bank file is **digitally signed (DSC/HSM)**, not merely checksummed.
- All money math uses fixed-point decimal (no binary float); rounding rules are explicit and configurable (default: round to nearest rupee, half-up; statutory deductions per their own rounding rules). **A designated rounding-adjustment component absorbs per-payslip residue so gross/net tie exactly.**
- **Determinism extends upstream:** a run is a pure function of (salary structure version, effective rate tables, M10 inputs, prior immutable line ledger, **and the cross-module snapshot** of M01/M03/M06/M09/org taken as-of the cutoff).
- **YTD is derived, never a mutable scalar:** statutory/tax year-to-date totals are the immutable sum over `payslip_lines` for the FY; `deductions.cumulative_ytd` is only a recomputable cache.

**Segregation of duties:** maker ≠ checker is enforced — the Payroll Officer who runs/prepares cannot approve/lock, **DSC-sign the bank file, or confirm positive-pay**; the SysAdmin who configures tables cannot run or approve payroll for which they are also an employee subject. **The principal who DSC-signs the bank file must differ from the run creator; the principal who confirms the treasury debit (positive pay) before a resend must differ from the one who transmitted.**

## 4. Shared Application Foundation

M10 inherits the Shared Foundation §5 technical defaults verbatim: React + TypeScript (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) frontend; REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL primary store; encrypted object storage for payslips/Form-16; OIDC/SSO + MFA; JWT + RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; canonical error envelope; OWASP ASVS; TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest; DPDP Act 2023 alignment; P95 < 500ms (interactive), batch SLAs defined in §9; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h.

**M10-specific foundation extensions:**

- **Money type:** `NUMERIC(15,2)` fixed-point for all amounts; rates as `NUMERIC(9,4)`; no floating point in computation. A **rounding-adjustment component** absorbs `Σ(rounded) − round(Σ)` residue per payslip so identities tie exactly.
- **Computation determinism (extended):** the run engine is a pure function of (salary structure version, rate tables effective on pay period, employee inputs, **prior immutable line ledger**, **and the cross-module input snapshot**). Same inputs + same snapshot → same outputs.
- **Cross-module snapshot:** every run persists an immutable `run_input_snapshots` row capturing the as-of values of M01 (employee/bank/PAN/scheme), M03 (attendance), M06 (fixation), M09 (recovery), and org_unit. Determinism and audit extend to upstream data (FR-22).
- **Immutability & versioning:** finalised payroll runs and their payslips are append-only snapshots; corrections create new artefacts; **reopen produces a new payslip *version*** (originals → REVERSED) with a lock-to-lock diff in `audit_log`.
- **YTD as derived ledger:** statutory/tax YTD is the immutable Σ over `payslip_lines` for the FY; `deductions.cumulative_ytd` is a recomputable cache only — never the source of truth.
- **Idempotency + single-in-flight:** all run/disbursement mutating endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key`; additionally a **single-in-flight-run constraint** per cycle prevents two concurrent FINAL (or conflicting) runs.
- **Transactionality:** a payroll run commits as an all-or-nothing transaction per run; partial computation is held in a staging area until validated.
- **Disbursement safety:** bank files are **DSC/HSM digitally signed**; a **bank-side unique batch reference** plus **positive-pay/treasury-debit reconciliation** guard against duplicate disbursement; excluded/failed net pay is parked in a **suspense-hold ledger** so it never leaves the tie-out.
- **Encryption:** bank account numbers, PAN, salary amounts, and **DSC key material** are PII/financial/secret data — encrypted at rest, masked in UI by default, access logged; cryptographic signing keys live in an HSM, never in the application database.

### 5.2 Full Field Tables — amended v1 entities (delta only) and new v2 entities

> v1 entities E04–E23 retain their full field tables from v1.0 verbatim except for the deltas below. New entities E29–E35 are specified in full.

#### E05 `pay_components` — amended

Adds to `category` enum: `PERQUISITE`, `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT`, `LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`. New field `dsl_grammar_version TEXT NULL` (pins the DSL grammar a FORMULA component was authored against; see FR-01/Appendix 16.7). All other fields unchanged.

#### E07 `rate_tables` — amended

Adds field `state TEXT NULL` (required when `table_type=PT_SLAB`; the employee's state of posting resolves the slab). Uniqueness/non-overlap key for PT becomes `(table_type, state, slab_min, slab_max, effective_from)`. All other fields unchanged.

#### E11 `payroll_runs` — amended

Adds: `snapshot_id UUID FK→run_input_snapshots NULL` (the cross-module as-of snapshot the run computed against); `in_flight_lock_key TEXT NULL` (advisory-lock token; partial unique index enforces one active FINAL run per cycle); `superseded_run_id UUID NULL` (set when a reopen creates a successor run). All other fields unchanged.

#### E12 `payslips` — amended

Adds: `version INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1`; `superseded_by_payslip_id UUID FK→payslips NULL`; `supersession_reason ENUM(REOPEN, ARREAR_LINK, CORRECTION) NULL`; `snapshot_id UUID FK→run_input_snapshots NULL` (the upstream facts this payslip was computed from — bank account, scheme, org, PAN). `status` enum gains `SUPERSEDED`. On reopen the original moves to REVERSED/SUPERSEDED and a new `version` row is written. All other fields unchanged.

#### E14 `deductions` — amended

`cumulative_ytd` is **demoted to a recomputable cache** (documented: "non-authoritative; YTD truth = Σ `payslip_lines` for the FY"). Adds: `carryforward_id UUID FK→deduction_carryforwards NULL` (link when an amount could not be recovered and rolled forward); `attachment_exemption_basis TEXT NULL` (CPC s.60 exemption note for `COURT_ATTACHMENT`). All other fields unchanged.

#### E15 `tax_declarations` — amended

Adds: `previous_employer_income JSONB NULL` (Form-12B: gross salary, exemptions, TDS already deducted by prior employer for mid-year joiners); `relief_89_1 JSONB NULL` (Form-10E working — arrears spread across FYs and the computed relief); `surcharge NUMERIC(15,2) NULL`; `marginal_relief NUMERIC(15,2) NULL`; `cess NUMERIC(15,2) NULL`; `rebate_87a NUMERIC(15,2) NULL`; `standard_deduction NUMERIC(15,2) NULL`; `perquisite_total NUMERIC(15,2) NULL` (from E32). All other fields unchanged.

#### E16 `loans_advances` — amended

Adds: `is_concessional BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT false` (true when interest_rate is below the prescribed SBI/Rule-3 reference rate, generating a taxable perquisite); `perquisite_reference_rate NUMERIC(9,4) NULL`; `perquisite_id UUID FK→perquisites NULL` (the perquisite this loan generates). All other fields unchanged.

(All v1 enums not listed here are unchanged.)

### 5.6 Data Integrity Rules (v2 — amended #4, #9, #13; added #14–#18)

1. **Earning/deduction identity:** for each payslip, `gross_earnings = Σ(lines where type=EARNING)`, `total_deductions = Σ(lines where type=DEDUCTION)`, `net_pay = gross_earnings − total_deductions`, `net_pay ≥ 0`. **A `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` line absorbs `Σ(rounded)−round(Σ)` so the identity holds to the rupee.**
2. **Run totals:** `payroll_runs.gross_total/deduction_total/net_total` equal the sums of their (non-superseded) payslips; enforced at commit.
3. **Reconciliation gate:** a run cannot move to APPROVED unless a `payroll_reconciliations` row exists with `signoff_status=SIGNED_OFF` and zero unexplained variance.
4. **Bank-file integrity (REDEFINED — R2):** `Σ disbursed(net via bank file) + Σ held(disbursement_holds) + Σ failed(ack_failed) = payroll_runs.net_total` for the run. **No net pay leaves the tie-out silently;** excluded/invalid-account net is parked in `disbursement_holds` and re-disbursed via off-cycle. `record_count` = payees with net>0 *and* a valid account.
5. **Immutability & versioning:** when `payroll_runs.status=LOCKED`, all child payslips/lines are read-only (`is_immutable=true`); any change requires a new arrear/supplementary/off-cycle run **or a reopen that creates a new payslip `version` (original→SUPERSEDED/REVERSED)**.
6. **Effective-dating:** only one ACTIVE `employee_salary_structures` version per employee per date; overlapping effective ranges rejected.
7. **Statutory caps:** GPF/NPS/gratuity/PT/perquisite respect configured caps; computed amounts cannot exceed statutory ceilings.
8. **Loan ledger:** `Σ loan_repayments.principal_component = loans_advances.principal` at CLOSED; `outstanding_principal` monotonically non-increasing.
9. **YTD derivation (REDEFINED — R3):** statutory/tax YTD = immutable `Σ payslip_lines` for the FY over the **surviving (non-superseded)** payslip versions across regular+arrears+off-cycle. `deductions.cumulative_ytd` is a cache that must equal this derivation after any recompute; Form-16/Form-24Q derive from the ledger, guaranteeing tie-out and safe reopen.
10. **SoD:** `payroll_runs.approved_by ≠ created_by`; `bank_disbursements.signed_by ≠ run creator`; **positive-pay confirmer ≠ transmitter**; `fnf_settlements.approved_by ≠ created_by`.
11. **One structure snapshot per payslip:** `payslips.structure_version_ref` points to the structure version effective on the cycle period; **`payslips.snapshot_id` points to the run's frozen cross-module snapshot.**
12. **FK integrity & soft delete:** an employee with any non-CLOSED loan, active deduction, open carryforward, or unsettled gratuity/FnF cannot be hard-deleted; soft delete only.
13. **Single-in-flight run (NEW — R11):** a partial unique index / advisory lock permits at most one active (QUEUED/RUNNING/COMPLETED-unlocked) FINAL run per `cycle_id`; a second concurrent attempt fails with `RUN_ALREADY_IN_FLIGHT`.
14. **Remittance reconciliation (NEW — R4):** for each scheme/period, `statutory_remittances.deducted_total = Σ payslip_lines` for that scheme/period; status reaches MATCHED only when `deposited_amount` ties to `remittable_total` within the documented tolerance; OVERDUE when `today > statutory_due_date` and status < DEPOSITED; `late_interest` computed for late deposits.
15. **GL balance (NEW — R4):** `gl_journals.total_debit = total_credit`; the net-pay clearing line equals `Σ disbursed + Σ held`.
16. **Snapshot determinism (NEW — R6):** a FINAL run's `snapshot.checksum` is recorded; re-running against the same frozen snapshot reproduces identical payslips.
17. **Perquisite into tax (NEW — R5):** every ACTIVE `perquisites.taxable_value` for the FY is included in `tax_declarations.perquisite_total` and in projected taxable income; a concessional/interest-free loan (E16 `is_concessional=true`) must have a linked `perquisites` row.
18. **Carryforward conservation (NEW — R8):** `deduction_carryforwards.outstanding = original_amount − recovered_to_date ≥ 0`; recovery across cycles never exceeds the original ordered/owed amount.

### FR-M10-01 — Pay Component & Rules Engine Configuration (constrained, versioned DSL)

- **Module:** M10-F01 / M10-F02
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (config), Payroll Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to define earning/deduction/perquisite components and their versioned computation rules — against a **pinned, independently-versioned DSL grammar** — so that payroll math is configurable without code changes, fully auditable, and the formula escape hatch is bounded and safe.
- **Description:** Maintain the `pay_components` catalog and `pay_rules` (formula DSL, calc method, eligibility, rounding, computation order, effective dates). Rules are versioned; activating a new version retires the prior version's effective range. **The safe expression evaluator (Appendix 16.7) pins decimal semantics (fixed-point `NUMERIC`, no float), null-propagation (any null operand → rule exception, never silent 0), operator precedence, and a whitelisted token/function set; the DSL grammar carries its own `dsl_grammar_version`, versioned independently of rule versions.** The `FORMULA` escape hatch is restricted to vetted, property-tested expressions; arbitrary code execution is prohibited.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A component can be created with type, category (incl. `PERQUISITE`, `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT`, `LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`), calc method, taxable flag, and display order.
  - AC2: A rule version with an invalid expression (unknown reference, unbalanced parentheses, disallowed token, **ambiguous precedence, or a null-yielding reference**) is rejected with a precise error and line/column.
  - AC3: Activating a rule version sets `effective_to` on the prior ACTIVE version to one day before the new `effective_from`; no two ACTIVE versions overlap.
  - AC4: Computation order is unique within an effective window; duplicate orders rejected; **forward references to not-yet-computed components rejected (no circular refs).**
  - AC5: All changes require Payroll Manager approval (maker-checker) before becoming ACTIVE.
  - AC6: **A FORMULA component records the `dsl_grammar_version` it was authored against; a grammar upgrade re-validates (or quarantines) existing FORMULA rules before they run.**
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: A component referenced by any active employee structure cannot be deleted; only deactivated.
  - BR2: DEDUCTION components flagged `is_statutory=true` cannot be overridden below the statutory computation by a Payroll Officer.
  - BR3: Formula references are resolved in `computation_order`; forward references rejected.
  - BR4: **DSL property tests (decimal rounding, null propagation, precedence, division-by-zero) must pass before a FORMULA rule can be activated.**
- **Data Model References:** `pay_components`, `pay_rules`, `rate_tables`, `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/components` | create component |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/components/{id}/rules` | add rule version |

| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/components` | list (paginated) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/dsl/grammar` | current DSL grammar version & token set |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Rule editor with live syntax validation, a "test against sample employee" panel showing the evaluated trace, a version timeline, and a **DSL-grammar badge**. Activation button disabled for makers.
- **Edge Cases:** Circular references; activating a rule whose `rate_table` has no effective row for the period; deactivating a component mid-FY; **a grammar-version upgrade invalidating an in-use FORMULA rule.**
- **LLD:**

### FR-M10-02 — Pay Scale / Matrix & Statutory Rate Table Management (PT by state)

- **Module:** M10-F01
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator, Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As an Administrator, I want to maintain pay-matrix levels and effective-dated statutory rate tables (DA%, HRA class %, **PT slabs keyed by state**, tax slabs, GPF/NPS rates) so that revisions issued by enterprise notifications apply automatically from their effective date, including for multi-state employees.
- **Description:** CRUD for `pay_matrix_levels` and `rate_tables`, all effective-dated. **PT slabs carry a `state` dimension; resolution uses the employee's state of posting (from the cross-module snapshot).** A DA revision is entered once and applies to every eligible employee from `effective_from` (including retrospectively, triggering arrears via FR-10).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A new DA rate with a past `effective_from` is accepted and flagged "retrospective — will generate arrears".
  - AC2: Two overlapping effective rows for the same `table_type/state/key/regime/FY` are rejected.
  - AC3: Tax slabs require `regime` and `financial_year`; PT slabs require `state`, `slab_min`, `slab_max`.
  - AC4: Changes are versioned and audited; no in-place edit of a row already used in a LOCKED run (a new effective row is created instead).
  - AC5: **PT resolution for an employee returns the slab for the employee's snapshotted state of posting; a missing state→slab mapping raises a precise exception.**
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: HRA class % keyed by `city_class` (X/Y/Z).
  - BR2: A rate row used by any locked payslip is immutable; corrections are new effective rows.
  - BR3: Effective dates align to the 1st of a month unless an explicit mid-month proration policy is enabled.
  - BR4: **PT is resolved by state of posting, not legal-entity default; an employee transferred across states mid-year uses the destination state's slab from the effective transfer date.**
- **Data Model References:** `rate_tables` (incl. `state`), `pay_matrix_levels`, `pay_scales` (ref), `arrears` (downstream), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/rate-tables` | add effective-dated rate (PT requires `state`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/rate-tables?type=PT_SLAB&state=KARNATAKA&date=` | resolve rate as-of |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/pay-matrix` | add matrix level/cell |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Effective-dated grid with "as-of date" + **state selector**; retrospective-entry warning banner; side-by-side compare of old vs new rate.
- **Edge Cases:** DA increase notified after the cycle is locked → arrears next cycle; pay-matrix cell deletion when referenced by a structure; mid-month DA effective date; **employee with no PT-state mapping; inter-state transfer mid-month.**
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RateTableController`, `EffectiveDateResolver`, `PayMatrixService`, `PtStateResolver` |
| Backend Flow | Validate effective range → check non-overlap (incl. state) → persist → if `effective_from` < current open cycle start, enqueue arrears candidate scan |
| Data Operations | INSERT rate row; never UPDATE locked-referenced rows |
| Validation | Non-overlap by (type,state,key,regime,FY); required fields by table_type; immutability vs locked runs |
| Authorization | SysAdmin write; Payroll Mgr approve; Auditor read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | New rate active; arrears scan enqueued; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Overlap → 409 `RATE_OVERLAP`; locked-ref edit → 409 `RATE_LOCKED_IMMUTABLE`; missing PT state → 422 `PT_STATE_NOT_MAPPED` |
| Dependencies | FR-10 arrears engine, FR-22 snapshot (state of posting) |
| Test Guidance | Resolver boundary dates; retrospective trigger; PT-by-state resolution; inter-state transfer |

### FR-M10-03 — Employee Salary Structure Assignment & Versioning

- **Module:** M10-F03
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (maker), Payroll Manager (checker), HR Admin (request)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to assign and version each employee's salary structure (pay level, city class, component set, overrides) so that pay is derived correctly and every change is effective-dated and auditable.
- **Description:** Bind an employee to a `pay_matrix_level` and component set, producing `employee_salary_structures` + `employee_salary_components`. Each change (increment, revision, override) creates a new version; the prior version is SUPERSEDED. Overrides require a reason. Scheme (GPF vs NPS) is auto-attached by DOJ.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Creating a new version supersedes the prior ACTIVE version with contiguous effective ranges (no gap/overlap).
  - AC2: A FIXED_OVERRIDE component requires `override_amount` and `override_reason`.
  - AC3: Structure changes route through maker-checker before becoming ACTIVE.
  - AC4: A change with `effective_from` in a LOCKED period is rejected — handled as an arrear (FR-10).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Exactly one ACTIVE version per employee at any date. BR2: City class drives HRA. BR3: Statutory deduction components auto-attached by scheme (GPF vs NPS per joining date).
- **Data Model References:** `employee_salary_structures`, `employee_salary_components`, `pay_matrix_levels`, `pay_components`, `deductions`, `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/structures` | create new version |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/structures` | version history |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/structures/{id}:approve` | checker approve |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Structure builder showing auto-resolved components vs overrides; effective-date timeline; diff of versions; HRA auto-updates when city class changes.
- **Edge Cases:** GPF vs NPS by DOJ cutoff; mid-month transfer changing city class/**state**; override exceeding sanity bounds.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `StructureController`, `StructureVersionService`, `SchemeResolver` |
| Backend Flow | Build component set from rules + scheme → apply overrides → validate → create version → close prior → maker-checker → ACTIVE |
| Data Operations | INSERT structure + components; UPDATE prior `effective_to`/status; transactional |
| Validation | Contiguity; override reason; locked-period guard; scheme correctness |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer create; Payroll Mgr approve |
| State Changes & Side Effects | new ACTIVE version; SR-relevant pay change emits M12 event on finalisation; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Locked period → 409 `STRUCTURE_PERIOD_LOCKED`; overlap → 409 `STRUCTURE_OVERLAP` |
| Dependencies | FR-01/02, M06 (pay-fixation source), FR-10 |
| Test Guidance | Version contiguity; GPF/NPS by DOJ; override audit |

### FR-M10-04 — Monthly Payroll Run Engine (single-in-flight, rounding-balanced)

- **Module:** M10-F04
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (run), Payroll Manager (oversee)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to execute the monthly payroll run that computes every eligible employee's pay deterministically from a frozen cross-module snapshot so that gross, deductions, and net are derived from versioned rules and snapshotted inputs, with no concurrent conflicting run.
- **Description:** Orchestrates the cycle: freeze inputs at cutoff **and take the cross-module snapshot (FR-22)**, gather structure snapshots + leave/LWP (FR-05) + statutory deductions (FR-06) + loan recoveries (FR-08) + arrears (FR-10) + perquisites (FR-21), evaluate rules in computation order, **append a `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` line to absorb residue**, persist `payslips` + `payslip_lines` with full `calc_trace`. Runs in a staging area first; the run is a single atomic commit. Supports DRAFT and FINAL modes. **A single-in-flight constraint prevents two concurrent FINAL runs per cycle.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A draft run produces per-employee results with full computation trace and a quarantine list of failures (no partial commit).
  - AC2: Re-running the same cycle with unchanged inputs **and the same frozen snapshot** yields identical results (determinism).
  - AC3: Employees with computation errors are isolated; the run reports them without aborting valid computations.
  - AC4: `net_pay ≥ 0`; **un-recovered amounts roll forward into `deduction_carryforwards` (owned backlog), not silently dropped.**
  - AC5: Run totals equal the sum of payslips at commit; the rounding-adjustment line makes identities tie to the rupee.
  - AC6: **A second FINAL run attempt for a cycle with one in flight fails with `RUN_ALREADY_IN_FLIGHT`.**
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Only ACTIVE employees in the **snapshot** scope on the pay date are included (joiners/leavers prorated).
  - BR2: A FINAL run requires the cycle to be INPUT_LOCKED and a frozen snapshot to exist.
  - BR3: Computation uses rate tables effective on the period, not "today".
  - BR4: **Suspended employees receive subsistence allowance only (Appendix 16.6): initial percentage of pay, escalating after a configured number of months; dies-non periods produce no pay and no qualifying service.**
  - BR5: **Mid-month inter-DDO transfer uses the "DDO-of-record for the transfer month" (Appendix 16.8) unless split-period payslips are enabled.**
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_cycles`, `payroll_runs` (`snapshot_id`, `in_flight_lock_key`), `payslips`, `payslip_lines`, `run_input_snapshots`, `employee_salary_structures`, `deductions`, `deduction_carryforwards`, `loans_advances`, `arrears`, `perquisites`, `rate_tables`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/runs` | start a run (mode in body; acquires in-flight lock) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}` | run status & totals |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/exceptions` | per-employee failures |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:cancel` | cancel draft (releases lock) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Run console with progress (computed/total), live totals, exception drill-down, per-employee trace viewer, **snapshot reference & checksum**, and an **in-flight lock indicator**. FINAL run gated behind reconciliation.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-month joiner/leaver proration; suspended employee (subsistence); dies-non; missing structure; division-by-zero; very large cohort batch; **inter-DDO transfer month; concurrent FINAL attempt.**
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RunOrchestrator`, `ComputationEngine`, `InputAggregator`, `SnapshotBinder`, `RoundingBalancer`, `StagingRepository`, `InFlightLockManager`, async worker/queue |
| Backend Flow | Acquire in-flight lock → lock inputs → bind frozen snapshot → aggregate inputs (incl. perquisite monthly value) → compute components in order into staging → append rounding-adjustment → validate totals/identities → atomic commit payslips+lines+run totals → roll un-recovered to carryforwards |
| Data Operations | Bulk INSERT staging; transactional move to `payslips`/`payslip_lines`; UPDATE run totals; INSERT carryforwards |
| Validation | Identity equations; net≥0; scope eligibility; rate resolution; snapshot present; in-flight uniqueness |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer (own org scope); Manager read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | run QUEUED→RUNNING→COMPLETED/FAILED; cycle OPEN→COMPUTING→COMPUTED; audit_log; notifications |
| Failure Handling | Per-employee error → quarantine + `error_summary`; engine fault → run FAILED, no commit; concurrent FINAL → 409 `RUN_ALREADY_IN_FLIGHT`; idempotent restart |
| Dependencies | FR-01..03, 05, 06, 08, 10, 21, 22 |
| Test Guidance | Determinism vs frozen snapshot; proration; subsistence/dies-non; quarantine isolation; rounding tie-out; in-flight lock; large-batch perf; rollback on mid-commit failure |

### FR-M10-05 — Attendance & Leave (LWP) Input Integration (subsistence/dies-non)

- **Module:** M10-F05
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to ingest paid/unpaid day counts and Leave-Without-Pay (LWP) from M03 **as-of the cutoff snapshot** so that loss-of-pay deductions, subsistence, and dies-non are computed accurately.
- **Description:** Pull approved attendance/leave for the cycle from M03 **into the run snapshot (FR-22)** (paid days, LWP days, half-days, unauthorised absence). Compute LWP loss-of-pay (per-day rate = monthly pay / days-in-month or /30 per policy). **Subsistence (suspended employees) and dies-non (no pay/no service) are computed per Appendix 16.6.** Inputs freeze at cutoff; late changes route to arrears.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: LWP days reduce pay using the configured per-day basis; the reduction shows as a payslip line.
  - AC2: Paid_days + lwp_days reconcile to the period's calendar days for full-month employees.
  - AC3: Attendance received after cutoff is excluded (snapshot frozen) and queued for arrears/recovery.
  - AC4: Unauthorised absence beyond a threshold flags an exception (link to M09 if dies-non).
  - AC5: **A suspended employee is paid subsistence only; a dies-non period yields zero pay and zero qualifying service.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Per-day basis configurable (actual days vs 30-day). BR2: Half-pay leave reduces eligible components per policy. BR3: Joiner/leaver proration uses actual paid days. BR4: **Subsistence base and escalation, and dies-non, per Appendix 16.6.**
- **Data Model References:** `payslips` (paid_days/lwp_days), `payslip_lines` (LWP/subsistence line), `run_input_snapshots` (m03_facts), M03 attendance (read), `arrears` (late inputs).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/attendance-inputs` | fetched M03 inputs (from snapshot) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/attendance-inputs:refresh` | re-pull before cutoff |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Attendance input grid (employee × paid/LWP/half/subsistence), exceptions highlighted, "refresh from M03" with cutoff/snapshot lock indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Retrospective leave regularisation post-lock; dies-non vs LWP; overlapping leave records; leave encashment interplay (FR-12).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `AttendanceInputAdapter` (M03 client), `LWPCalculator`, `SubsistenceCalculator` |
| Backend Flow | Fetch approved M03 records for period into snapshot → map to paid/LWP/half/dies-non → compute per-day deduction or subsistence → feed run engine |
| Data Operations | Stage attendance inputs in snapshot keyed to cycle; write LWP/subsistence lines during run |
| Validation | Day-count reconciliation; cutoff/snapshot enforcement; threshold checks |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer scope |
| State Changes & Side Effects | LWP/subsistence line; exception flags; arrears candidate for late records |
| Failure Handling | M03 unavailable → 503 `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`, retry; mismatch → exception list |
| Dependencies | M03, FR-04, FR-10, FR-22 |
| Test Guidance | Per-day basis variants; proration; post-cutoff handling; subsistence escalation; dies-non path |

### FR-M10-06 — Statutory Deductions Computation (GPF/PF, NPS, PT-by-state, Pension, Insurance)

- **Module:** M10-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want statutory deductions computed automatically per scheme and slab so that GPF/PF, NPS, **professional tax by state of posting**, pension contribution, and insurance are accurate and remittable, with YTD derived from the immutable line ledger.
- **Description:** For each employee, compute scheme-based deductions: GPF/CPF (% of basic, with voluntary top-up), NPS (employee 10% + employer 14% of basic+DA), **professional tax (state slab resolved by snapshotted state of posting)**, pension/insurance contributions, court attachments. **YTD is the derived Σ over `payslip_lines` for the FY (data-integrity rule #9); `deductions.cumulative_ytd` is only a recomputable cache.** Feeds the remittance tracker (FR-19).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: NPS computes both employee and employer contributions; both appear (employer as info/cost line feeding the GL journal).
  - AC2: PT applies the correct **state** slab for the employee's gross within the month.
  - AC3: Statutory caps are enforced (e.g., GPF subscription limits).
  - AC4: **YTD figures recompute from the line ledger and remain correct across regular+arrears+off-cycle and after a reopen (no scalar drift).**
  - AC5: **Court-attachment deductions respect the CPC s.60 statutory exemption independently of the flat net-pay floor (FR-09); shortfall rolls into `deduction_carryforwards`.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: GPF for pre-cutoff joiners; NPS for post-cutoff joiners (scheme by DOJ). BR2: Court-attachment deductions take legal priority within net-pay protection and their own exemption. BR3: Employer NPS/pension contributions are costs, not employee deductions. BR4: **PT resolved by state of posting (FR-02/BR4).** BR5: **Subsistence-only employees compute statutory deductions on the subsistence base per Appendix 16.6.**
- **Data Model References:** `deductions` (cache YTD), `payslip_lines` (YTD truth), `rate_tables` (PT-by-state/NPS/GPF), `deduction_carryforwards`, `statutory_remittances` (downstream), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/deductions` | list deductions + derived YTD |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/deductions` | add voluntary/manual deduction |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/statutory-summary` | run-level statutory totals (feeds FR-19) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Deduction panel per employee showing scheme, rate, **derived YTD (with "recomputed from ledger" provenance)**; voluntary GPF top-up; employer-contribution info card; PT-state indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year scheme migration; PT slab boundary; **inter-state transfer changing PT**; court attachment exceeding protected net (carryforward); NPS crossing basic+DA threshold.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `StatutoryDeductionService`, `SchemeResolver`, `SlabResolver` (state-aware), `YtdLedgerDeriver` |

### FR-M10-07 — Income-Tax (TDS) Declarations, Proofs & Full Computation Pipeline

- **Module:** M10-F07 / M10-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (declare), Payroll Officer (verify), Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to declare investments, capture previous-employer income (Form-12B), choose a regime, upload proofs, and see a transparent, traceable projected tax — surcharge, cess, rebate, and relief included — so that TDS is deducted accurately across the year.
- **Description:** Employees submit `tax_declarations` (regime, 80C/80D/HRA/home-loan items, **Form-12B previous-employer income**), upload proofs (M13). The engine projects annual taxable income — **including taxable perquisites from FR-21** — and computes tax through the **full documented pipeline: gross taxable → standard deduction → Chapter VI-A → slab tax (regime-correct) → surcharge (with marginal relief) → 4% health & education cess → 87A rebate → relief u/s 89(1) via Form-10E** — spreading TDS across remaining months. The opaque v1 `projected_tax` is replaced by this traceable chain (intermediate values persisted on `tax_declarations`). Payroll verifies proofs after cutoff; unverified declarations revert to conservative computation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Switching regime recomputes the full pipeline and per-month TDS.
  - AC2: After proof cutoff, unverified declared deductions are excluded and TDS recomputed.
  - AC3: Declaration locks after FY proof cutoff (`lock_after_cutoff`).
  - AC4: Projected tax updates when salary/arrears/**perquisites** change.
  - AC5: **The computation persists each stage (std deduction, Ch-VI-A, slab, surcharge, marginal relief, cess, 87A, 89(1)) and is shown to the employee as a step-by-step breakdown.**
  - AC6: **Mid-year joiners' previous-employer income (Form-12B) is included in projected income and TDS.**
  - AC7: **Cross-FY arrears generate Form-10E relief reflected in TDS and Form-16.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: New regime ignores most exemptions per statute. BR2: `TDS = (projected annual tax − YTD TDS from ledger) / remaining months`. BR3: Proof verification is maker-checker; partial verification reduces allowed amount. BR4: **Surcharge applies at statutory thresholds with marginal relief; 4% cess on (tax+surcharge); 87A rebate per regime limits.** BR5: **Perquisite value (FR-21) is added to taxable income before slab tax.**
- **Data Model References:** `tax_declarations` (incl. 12B/10E/surcharge/cess/87A/std-deduction/perquisite_total), `perquisites`, `documents` (proofs), `deductions` (TDS), `payslip_lines` (TDS YTD truth), `rate_tables` (TAX_SLAB).

### FR-M10-08 — Loans & Advances Management (concessional-loan perquisite linkage)

- **Module:** M10-F08
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), DDO/Dept Head (sanction), Payroll Officer (schedule/recover)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to apply for loans/advances and have installments recovered automatically through payroll so that repayment is accurate, with interest, and any concessional-interest perquisite is correctly taxed.
- **Description:** Lifecycle for HBA/vehicle/computer/festival/GPF/salary advances: request → sanction → disburse → installment recovery (principal + interest) via payroll → foreclosure/closure. Maintains `loans_advances` + `loan_repayments` ledger; supports reducing/simple interest, holds, and foreclosure. **When the charged interest rate is below the prescribed reference rate, the loan is flagged `is_concessional` and generates a taxable perquisite (FR-21) wired into TDS (FR-07).**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: On each run, the scheduled installment is recovered and the ledger updated (outstanding decreases).
  - AC2: Final installment closes the loan; `Σ principal_components = principal`.
  - AC3: Foreclosure computes outstanding principal + accrued interest and settles in one entry.
  - AC4: If net pay is insufficient, recovery is partial/skipped per policy and the shortfall rolls into `deduction_carryforwards`.
  - AC5: **A concessional/interest-free loan automatically creates/updates a `perquisites` row (Rule 3, reducing-balance × (reference − charged) rate); a rate change revises the perquisite.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Total deductions cannot push net below the protected minimum; loan recovery yields after statutory. BR2: Interest method fixed at sanction. BR3: A loan on hold skips recovery without penalty unless policy charges interest. BR4: **Concessional-loan perquisite valuation per Appendix 16.7/Rule 3; perquisite spread monthly into taxable income.**
- **Data Model References:** `loans_advances` (`is_concessional`, `perquisite_id`), `loan_repayments`, `perquisites`, `payslip_lines` (recovery line), `deduction_carryforwards`, `audit_log`, workflow (sanction).

### FR-M10-09 — Recoveries & Ad-hoc Adjustments (net-pay floor, attachment exemption, legal-eligibility gate)

- **Module:** M10-F09
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager, DDO (overpayment adjudication), (source) Disciplinary Authority (M09)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to apply recoveries ordered by disciplinary authorities and recover prior overpayments within a defined net-pay floor and statutory exemptions — and only where legally permitted — so that mandated deductions are executed accurately, traceably, and lawfully.
- **Description:** Ingest recovery orders from M09 and internally-detected overpayments; schedule recovery across cycles **within a configurable protected net-pay floor (per cadre/jurisdiction) and the CPC s.60 attachment exemption**; track recovered-to-date against ordered amount; **roll unmet amounts into `deduction_carryforwards` (owned, aged backlog)**. **Before scheduling an overpayment recovery, flag legally-barred cases (e.g., low-grade/retired employees per the Rafiq Masih line of rulings) for explicit DDO/authority decision with recorded justification.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A disciplinary recovery order creates a scheduled recovery with a defined total and per-cycle amount.
  - AC2: Recovery never exceeds the ordered total; over-recovery is impossible.
  - AC3: Recovery respects the **configurable net-pay floor and per-attachment CPC s.60 exemption**; spillover rolls into carryforwards.
  - AC4: Recovered-to-date is reported and closes when the order is satisfied.
  - AC5: **An overpayment recovery against a legally-barred case is blocked until an authority records an explicit decision and justification.**
  - AC6: **Rolled-forward un-recovered deductions appear in a managed backlog screen with owner and ageing (FR-24/§12).**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Disciplinary recoveries are authority-mandated and cannot be waived by Payroll. BR2: Overpayment recovery requires documented justification, **legal-eligibility check**, and employee notification. BR3: Recovery priority: statutory → court attachment (within s.60 exemption) → disciplinary → overpayment → loans → voluntary. BR4: **The protected floor is a configurable value (cadre/jurisdiction), distinct from the attachment exemption.**
- **Data Model References:** `deductions` (RECOVERY; `attachment_exemption_basis`), `deduction_carryforwards`, `payslip_lines`, M09 order (read), `audit_log`.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Recovery tracker showing ordered vs recovered vs remaining; source-order link; priority indicator; **net-floor & exemption indicators; legal-eligibility flag with adjudication action; carryforward ageing**.
- **Edge Cases:** Multiple concurrent recoveries competing for limited net; employee retires before full recovery (FnF/M11); appeal in M09 reverses an order mid-recovery (refund); legally-barred retiree overpayment.

### FR-M10-10 — Arrears & Retrospective Revisions Engine (dependent-allowance cascade)

- **Module:** M10-F10
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want the system to compute arrears for back-dated DA/increment/promotion/pay-fixation so that employees receive the exact difference owed, with **all dependent allowances recomputed** and statutory deductions and Form-10E relief re-derived on the differential.
- **Description:** When a retrospective change occurs (DA revision FR-02, pay-fixation M06, correction), the engine re-computes pay for each affected past month using then-effective rules. **A retrospective basic-pay change recomputes every dependent component in computation order for each historical month — DA (% basic), HRA (city-class % basic), TPT, NPS (basic+DA), GPF (% basic) — not just basic.** It derives the per-component per-month delta vs what was actually paid, recomputes statutory deductions (incl. TDS) on the differential, **flows the arrear TDS delta through the corrected YTD ledger and Form-10E relief**, and produces an `arrears` record paid through an ARREARS cycle.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: For a back-dated basic/DA increase, arrears = Σ over affected months of (new − old) for **basic and every dependent component**, net of recomputed deductions.
  - AC2: The arrear references the source (notification/M06 order) and shows a month-wise, component-wise break-up.
  - AC3: Arrears recompute TDS impact via the **derived YTD ledger** and flow into Form-16/Form-10E (FR-17/FR-07).
  - AC4: Arrears for a LOCKED period never mutate the original payslip — they are additive lines linked via `arrear_ref`.
  - AC5: **The dependent-allowance cascade is shown explicitly in the month-wise grid (basic delta → DA/HRA/TPT/NPS/GPF deltas).**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Arrears use rules effective in each historical month, not current rules. BR2: Negative arrears (downward revision) handled via recovery/carryforward. BR3: Promotion arrears link to M06 fixation order. BR4: **Cross-FY arrears generate Form-10E relief (FR-07).**
- **Data Model References:** `arrears` (`component_breakup` with cascade), `payslips`/`payslip_lines` (original read; arrear lines additive), `rate_tables` (historical), `payroll_cycles` (ARREARS), `deductions`, `tax_declarations` (10E).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears:compute` | compute for trigger (DA/fixation) with cascade |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears/{id}` | arrear breakup (component-wise cascade) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears/{id}:approve` | approve for payout |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Arrears computation screen with month-wise grid showing **basic delta and each dependent-component delta (DA/HRA/TPT/NPS/GPF)**, source reference, net arrear after deduction recompute, 10E relief preview, approve-to-cycle action.
- **Edge Cases:** Overlapping retrospective changes (DA + promotion same window); employee separated during arrear window (→FnF); arrears crossing FYs (10E); downward revision causing recovery/carryforward.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ArrearsEngine`, `HistoricalRecomputer`, `DependentCascadeResolver`, `RateTableResolver`, `Form10EService` |
| Backend Flow | Identify affected employees/months → recompute each month with historical rules → cascade dependent components in computation order → diff vs actual paid → recompute statutory delta → 10E relief → persist arrear → route to ARREARS cycle |
| Data Operations | INSERT arrears with cascade `component_breakup`; additive `payslip_lines` with `arrear_ref`; link payout cycle; no mutation of originals |
| Validation | Historical rule resolution; cascade completeness; delta correctness; period bounds; immutability of source payslips |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer compute; Manager approve |
| State Changes & Side Effects | arrear COMPUTED→APPROVED→PAID; TDS YTD adjusted via ledger; 10E relief; M12 pay event if pay-scale changed |

### FR-M10-11 — Supplementary & Off-Cycle Payroll

- **Module:** M10-F11
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, DDO (sanction), Payroll Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to process supplementary and off-cycle payments so that missed payments, new-joiner first pay, bonuses, ex-gratia, **re-disbursement of held net pay**, and urgent corrections are paid outside the regular cycle with the same controls.
- **Description:** Create SUPPLEMENTARY/OFF_CYCLE/BONUS cycles for a defined employee set and component set, compute with the same engine and controls (snapshot, reconciliation, approval, DSC-signed bank file), and feed the same **derived YTD ledger**. Off-cycle payments require sanction. **Off-cycle is the channel that clears `disbursement_holds` (suspense) once accounts are corrected.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An off-cycle payment for a defined cohort computes, reconciles, approves, and disburses independently of the regular cycle.
  - AC2: Off-cycle amounts contribute to the derived YTD ledger (statutory and tax).
  - AC3: Off-cycle requires DDO sanction and Manager approval (SoD enforced).
  - AC4: A duplicate off-cycle payment for the same purpose/employee is prevented (idempotency).
  - AC5: **Re-disbursing a held suspense amount references the originating `disbursement_holds` row and closes it on success.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Bonus/ex-gratia taxability applied per rules. BR2: Off-cycle cannot pay a component already paid for the same period unless flagged correction. BR3: Same reconciliation and locking gates apply. BR4: **Single-in-flight constraint applies per off-cycle cycle.**
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_cycles` (OFF_CYCLE/SUPPLEMENTARY), `payroll_runs`, `payslips`, `bank_disbursements`, `disbursement_holds`, `deductions`.

### FR-M10-12 — Benefits Administration (Medical, LTC/LTA, Gratuity, Insurance, Reimbursements, Leave Encashment)

- **Module:** M10-F12
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (claim), Reporting Manager (recommend), Payroll Officer/Manager (verify/pay)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to enrol in and claim benefits (medical, LTC/LTA, reimbursements, **leave encashment**) and have gratuity/insurance administered so that I receive entitlements correctly and they reflect in pay, FnF, or off-cycle payout.
- **Description:** Manage benefit enrolment (`benefits`) and claims (`benefit_claims`, incl. `LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`) with workflow approval; accrue gratuity per period (`gratuity_accruals`); administer group insurance and reimbursement plans. **Leave encashment is computed as `eligible leave balance × per-day basis (basic+DA/30 or policy)`, subject to caps and taxability, and can feed regular pay, FnF (FR-20), or off-cycle.** Approved claims pay via payroll or off-cycle; LTC respects block-year rules.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A claim follows submit → recommend → approve → pay; approved amount ≤ entitlement/cap.
  - AC2: LTC claim validates block-year eligibility and prior utilisation.
  - AC3: Gratuity accrues per period using last-drawn basic+DA and years of service, capped at statutory ceiling.
  - AC4: Approved reimbursements appear on payslip (taxable per rules) or off-cycle payout.
  - AC5: **Leave encashment computes from the eligible balance × per-day basis with statutory cap and taxability; exempt portion (per s.10(10AA) for retirement) is excluded from taxable income.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Medical/LTC reimbursement taxability per statute. BR2: Gratuity payout settled by M11/FnF at separation; M10 maintains accrual. BR3: Claims require proofs (M13); duplicate proof reuse blocked. BR4: **Leave-encashment eligibility/caps configurable; retirement encashment exemption applied; encashment in service is taxable.**
- **Data Model References:** `benefits` (incl. LEAVE_ENCASHMENT), `benefit_claims`, `gratuity_accruals`, `documents`, `payslip_lines`/off-cycle, `fnf_settlements` (encashment feed), workflow.

### FR-M10-13 — Payslip Generation, Self-Service Access & Reopen Versioning

- **Module:** M10-F13
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate/publish), Employee (view)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to view and download my monthly payslip with a full earnings/deductions break-up so that I understand my pay; and as Payroll I want to publish payslips securely once the run is locked, with **clear versioning when a period is reopened**.
- **Description:** Render `payslips` into a formatted document (PDF) stored in M13, with employer/employee details, component break-up, **derived YTD figures**, leave/LWP, loan/recovery status, perquisite and tax summary. Published only after run lock; immutable thereafter. **On reopen (FR-16) the original payslip becomes SUPERSEDED/REVERSED and a new payslip `version` is published; employees see the version history with the active version highlighted.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Payslip totals match `payslips`/`payslip_lines` exactly (incl. rounding-adjustment).
  - AC2: Payslips publish only when the run is LOCKED.
  - AC3: Employees see only their own payslips; managers see direct reports per scope.
  - AC4: A published payslip is immutable; a correction generates a **new payslip version** (via reopen) or additive arrear/supplementary, with the prior version retained and marked SUPERSEDED.
  - AC5: **The payslip viewer shows the version number and a "what changed" summary between versions.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Bank account/PAN masked by default. BR2: Payslip includes **derived YTD** and tax-projection summary. BR3: Download access is logged. BR4: **Superseded versions remain accessible read-only for audit.**
- **Data Model References:** `payslips` (`version`, `superseded_by_payslip_id`), `payslip_lines`, `documents` (PDF), `audit_log`.

### FR-M10-14 — Bank Disbursement: DSC-Signed File, Positive-Pay Guard & Suspense-Hold Reconciliation

- **Module:** M10-F14
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate), Payroll Manager (DSC-sign), Finance/Treasury (receive, positive-pay confirm)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want to generate, validate, **digitally sign (DSC/HSM)**, and transmit the bank disbursement file with a **unique bank-side batch reference**, and reconcile acknowledgements **and the treasury debit (positive pay)** so that net pay reaches every account exactly once, no payment is duplicated on resend, and no net pay leaves the tie-out silently.
- **Description:** Produce a `bank_disbursements` file (the **single treasury-certified format**; ISO20022/CUSTOM deferred) from a LOCKED run's net pay. **Excluded/invalid-account net pay is parked in `disbursement_holds` (suspense), not dropped** — preserving the tie-out `Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net`. The file carries a **bank-side unique batch reference (`bank_batch_ref`)** and is **DSC/HSM digitally signed** (checksum retained for integrity only). On transmit, the gateway echoes the batch reference. **A timeout/ambiguous ack moves the batch to `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`; resend is forbidden until a mandatory positive-pay/treasury-debit reconciliation confirms the credits did NOT post.** Failed lines route to off-cycle re-disbursement (FR-11) via their hold rows.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: **`Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net_total`** (data-integrity rule #4); `record_count` = payees with net>0 and a valid account.
  - AC2: File generation requires a LOCKED, reconciled run.
  - AC3: **DSC-signing is performed by a principal different from the run creator (SoD); the signature is verified on transmit and on ack.**
  - AC4: Acknowledgement reconciliation marks each line success/failed; failures move to `disbursement_holds`.
  - AC5: **On gateway timeout the batch goes `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`; the system blocks any resend until a positive-pay reconciliation against the treasury account confirms non-debit; resend then issues a NEW `bank_batch_ref`.**
  - AC6: **Held net pay is an owned, aged backlog visible in a register (FR-24/§12) and cleared only via off-cycle re-disbursement.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Invalid/missing/frozen bank accounts → excluded → `disbursement_holds`, never silently removed from the tie-out. BR2: A file is transmitted once per `bank_batch_ref`; re-transmission requires a new batch with reason **and a confirmed non-debit**. BR3: **DSC/HSM signature is authenticity/non-repudiation; checksum is integrity only.** BR4: **No resend without positive-pay confirmation by a principal ≠ the transmitter.**
- **Data Model References:** `bank_disbursements` (`bank_batch_ref`, `dsc_signature`, `signing_cert_ref`, positive-pay fields, status incl. `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`), `disbursement_holds`, `payslips` (net), `documents` (file), `audit_log`.

### FR-M10-15 — Payroll Register & Reconciliation (disbursed + held + failed = net)

- **Module:** M10-F15
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager (sign-off)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want a payroll register with control totals and variance analysis — **including the disbursed/held/failed split** — so that I can reconcile the run against the prior period and sign off before approval, with no money unaccounted.
- **Description:** Generate the payroll register (per-employee and component-summarised) and `payroll_reconciliations` with gross/deduction/net control totals, prior-period comparison, variance %, **and the disbursement tie-out `Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = net`**, plus an exceptions list (new joiners, leavers, large swings, negative nets, quarantined employees, **held suspense amounts, overdue remittances**). Sign-off is the gate before approval (FR-16).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Control totals equal the run totals and the sum of payslips (three-way tie-out, incl. rounding-adjustment).
  - AC2: Variance vs prior period is computed with drill-down to contributing employees/components.
  - AC3: A run cannot be approved until reconciliation is SIGNED_OFF.
  - AC4: All exceptions are listed and individually explainable/acknowledgeable.
  - AC5: **The disbursement tie-out (`disbursed + held + failed = net`) is displayed and must balance before disbursement is marked complete.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Variance beyond a configurable threshold requires explicit explanation before sign-off. BR2: Quarantined employees from FR-04 appear as exceptions and block sign-off until resolved or deferred. BR3: Sign-off is by a checker, not the run creator. BR4: **Held suspense amounts and overdue remittances surface as managed exceptions, not silent gaps.**
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_reconciliations`, `payroll_runs`, `payslips`, `disbursement_holds`, `statutory_remittances`, `audit_log`.

### FR-M10-16 — Payroll Approval, Finalisation, Locking & Reopen-Versioning

- **Module:** M10-F16
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Manager / Controller
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want to approve and lock a reconciled payroll run so that results become immutable, payslips can publish, and disbursement can proceed — with a controlled, justified, **versioned** reopen path only when essential.
- **Description:** Multi-level approval moves a reconciled run to APPROVED then LOCKED. Locking freezes all payslips/lines (`is_immutable=true`) and the cycle (LOCKED). **A reopen requires Manager authority + justification, supersedes the original payslips (REVERSED/SUPERSEDED), creates a new payslip `version` and a successor run, persists a structured lock-to-lock diff in `audit_log`, and recomputes derived YTD from the surviving version set.** Reopen is disabled once disbursement has been transmitted (corrections then go to arrears/supplementary). **The single-in-flight constraint prevents a reopen successor from colliding with another run.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Approval requires a SIGNED_OFF reconciliation; approver ≠ run creator.
  - AC2: Locking sets all child payslips immutable and the cycle to LOCKED.
  - AC3: No write to any locked payslip/line succeeds after lock.
  - AC4: **Reopen requires justification, supersedes originals, creates a new payslip version + successor run, records a lock-to-lock diff, recomputes YTD from surviving versions, and is blocked post-transmission.**
  - AC5: **A reopen/successor run cannot start while another FINAL run is in flight for the cycle (`RUN_ALREADY_IN_FLIGHT`).**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Maker-checker enforced at approval. BR2: Locked runs are the system of record for the period. BR3: Post-disbursement corrections only via arrears/supplementary/off-cycle. BR4: **Reopen versioning preserves the original immutable payslip; nothing is overwritten.**
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_runs` (`superseded_run_id`, `in_flight_lock_key`), `payroll_cycles`, `payslips` (`version`, `superseded_by_payslip_id`), `payroll_reconciliations`, `audit_log`, workflow.

### FR-M10-17 — Statutory Outputs: Form-16 (Part A from MATCHED deposits), Form-24Q & Schedules

- **Module:** M10-F17
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate), Payroll Manager (certify)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to generate Form-16, Form-24Q (quarterly TDS), and PT/GPF/NPS remittance schedules so that the organisation meets statutory filing and remittance obligations accurately and on time — **with Form-16 Part A derived from actually-deposited-and-matched TDS, not merely deducted TDS**.
- **Description:** Aggregate **derived YTD** earnings, deductions, and TDS to produce employee Form-16 (Part A/B), Form-24Q quarterly returns, and remittance schedules for PT, GPF, NPS, and pension. **Form-16 Part A reconciles to `statutory_remittances` rows in MATCHED status (deposited & challan/CIN-matched), making the deadline guarantee (G2) provable.** Form-16 Part B reflects the full TDS pipeline (FR-07) incl. perquisites, surcharge, cess, 87A, and 89(1) relief. Schedules feed FR-19. Outputs reconciled against registers and the line ledger, stored in M13.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Form-16 TDS totals tie to Σ TDS `payslip_lines` for the FY (incl. arrears) **and to MATCHED `statutory_remittances` for Part A**.
  - AC2: Form-24Q quarterly totals reconcile to the sum of monthly TDS in that quarter.
  - AC3: Remittance schedules list per-scheme amounts with employee/employer split and feed FR-19.
  - AC4: Outputs are certified (maker-checker) before release and stored/versioned.
  - AC5: **Form-16 Part A flags any TDS deducted but not yet MATCHED (deposited), preventing premature/incorrect certification.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Section 89(1) relief (Form-10E, FR-07) reflected where arrears span FYs. BR2: PAN mandatory for Form-16; missing PAN flagged. BR3: Remittance deadlines tracked with reminders (Notifications) **via FR-19**. BR4: **Part A derives from deposited/MATCHED amounts; deducted-but-undeposited TDS cannot appear as deposited.**
- **Data Model References:** `payslip_lines` (YTD truth), `statutory_remittances` (MATCHED), `tax_declarations` (10E), `deductions` (cache), `documents`, `audit_log`.

### FR-M10-18 — Parallel / What-If Run & Cost-to-Organisation Analytics

- **Module:** M10-F04 / M10-F18
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Manager, Department Head, Finance
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want to run what-if/parallel payroll scenarios and view cost-to-organisation analytics so that I can model the impact of DA revisions, increments, or restructuring and report payroll cost by org/cadre/component — with the comparison output exportable to a board paper.
- **Description:** Execute PARALLEL_WHATIF runs against proposed parameters (e.g., new DA%) without affecting live data, producing comparison reports vs the actual run. Provide cost analytics: total payroll cost, headcount cost, component-/org-wise breakdown, period trends, and employer-contribution costs (NPS/pension/gratuity accrual). **The comparison output is a structured, exportable board-ready artefact (CSV/PDF), not a developer diff.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A what-if run never writes live payslips/disbursements; results clearly labelled scenario data.
  - AC2: A comparison report shows delta (scenario vs actual) by component and org unit, **exportable as a board paper (PDF/CSV)**.
  - AC3: Cost analytics aggregate gross, deductions, net, and employer cost by org/cadre/component/period.
  - AC4: Analytics respect row-level org scope per role.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Scenario runs are retained for audit and labelled. BR2: Employer contributions and gratuity accrual included in true cost-to-org. BR3: Analytics read from locked runs for actuals; scenarios for projections. BR4: **What-if runs do not acquire the FINAL in-flight lock and never block live runs.**
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_runs` (PARALLEL_WHATIF, segregated), `payslips` (scenario), aggregates over `payslip_lines`, `gratuity_accruals`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/runs` (run_mode=PARALLEL_WHATIF) | scenario run |

| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/analytics/cost-to-org?groupBy=org_unit,component&period=` | cost analytics |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Scenario builder with parameter overrides; comparison view with **delta highlighting and an "export board paper" action**; analytics dashboard with drill-down charts and export; scope-aware filters.
- **Edge Cases:** Scenario over a very large cohort; comparing across structure versions; analytics across cycles with arrears.

### FR-M10-19 — Statutory Remittance & Liability Tracking + GL Cost-Journal Posting

- **Module:** M10-F21
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (capture challan), Payroll Manager (certify/match), Finance (confirm deposit & GL acknowledgement)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want every statutory deduction tracked from accrued → deposited → matched (with challan/CIN, deadline, and late-interest), and the payroll cost-journal exported with a posting status, so that the organisation can *prove* it remitted to the State on time and booked the cost — not merely computed it.
- **Description:** Closes the **deducted → deposited → matched** loop. For each scheme/period, a `statutory_remittances` row accrues the derived liability (from the line ledger), is scheduled against its `statutory_due_date`, captures the actual `challan_no`/`cin`/`deposit_date`/`deposited_amount`, **computes late-deposit interest u/s 201(1A)/234E when deposited late**, and reaches MATCHED when the deposit ties (within tolerance). Separately, a `gl_journals` cost-journal export object is produced per run (debits/credits per `gl_code`), exported to Finance ERP, and tracked through `POSTED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED` (M10 does not own the GL). This satisfies G2 and underpins Form-16 Part A (FR-17).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A remittance row is created per scheme/period with `deducted_total = Σ payslip_lines` for that scheme/period (data-integrity rule #14).
  - AC2: Capturing `challan_no`/`cin`/`deposit_date` moves status to DEPOSITED; matching the amount (within tolerance) moves it to MATCHED.
  - AC3: A row past `statutory_due_date` without deposit is OVERDUE; **late interest u/s 201(1A)/234E is computed automatically.**
  - AC4: **Form-16 Part A (FR-17) derives only from MATCHED remittances.**
  - AC5: A `gl_journals` row balances (`total_debit = total_credit`) and tracks `POSTED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED`; net-pay clearing line = `Σ disbursed + Σ held` (data-integrity rule #15).
  - AC6: **Overdue remittances and short-payments surface in the §12 backlog/exception reporting.**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Remittance amounts derive from the immutable ledger, never a mutable scalar. BR2: Documented CRA/GPF **rounding tolerance** absorbs per-employee residue (Appendix 16.2). BR3: Late interest formula configurable per scheme/section. BR4: **M10 tracks GL posting status only; Finance ERP is the GL book of record (§2.3 amended).**
- **Data Model References:** `statutory_remittances`, `gl_journals`, `payslip_lines` (derivation), `documents` (challan scans), `notifications` (deadlines), `audit_log`.

### FR-M10-20 — Full-and-Final Settlement (FnF)

- **Module:** M10-F22
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin (initiate), Payroll Officer (compute), DDO (sanction), Payroll Manager (approve), Finance (pay)
- **User Story:** As HR/Payroll, I want a single consolidated full-and-final settlement for every separating employee so that final-month pay, leave encashment, gratuity, notice-pay recovery, unrecovered loans, carryforwards, and a final TDS true-up net into one last payment (or recovery) — instead of a treasure hunt across five FRs.
- **Description:** On separation (superannuation/resignation/VRS/termination/death/dismissal), an FnF run (`payroll_cycles.run_type=FNF`) computes a `fnf_settlements` record netting: **final-month pay (prorated to last working date), leave encashment (FR-12, with retirement exemption), gratuity (settled/handed off to M11), notice-pay recovery, unrecovered loan principal+interest (FR-08), open `deduction_carryforwards`, and a final-year TDS true-up (FR-07)** into `net_settlement` (which may be negative → recovery). It has **its own reconciliation and SoD**, hands off pension/terminal-benefit data to M11, and emits the separation pay event to M12.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An FnF run produces a single `fnf_settlements` record consolidating all dues and recoveries.
  - AC2: `net_settlement = final_month_pay + leave_encashment + gratuity − notice_pay_recovery − loan_settlement − other_recoveries − final_tds` and ties to its own reconciliation.
  - AC3: FnF requires DDO sanction and Manager approval (approver ≠ creator).
  - AC4: **Open carryforwards and unrecovered loans are pulled into FnF; a negative net becomes a RECOVERY_PENDING obligation, not a silent write-off.**
  - AC5: **Gratuity is settled or handed off to M11 with a reference; last-pay-drawn and contribution history are supplied to M11.**
  - AC6: Final TDS true-up reflects full-year income incl. perquisites and any 89(1) relief.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Same immutability/locking/SoD discipline as a regular run. BR2: Death cases route gratuity/dues per nominee rules (M11). BR3: Leave-encashment retirement exemption (s.10(10AA)) applied. BR4: **No employee record can be fully closed with an open FnF in RECOVERY_PENDING.**
- **Data Model References:** `fnf_settlements`, `payroll_cycles` (FNF), `payslips`/`payslip_lines`, `loans_advances`, `deduction_carryforwards`, `benefit_claims` (encashment), `gratuity_accruals`, `payroll_reconciliations`, `service_register_events` (M12), `audit_log`.

### FR-M10-21 — Taxable Perquisite Valuation (Rule 3)

- **Module:** M10-F20
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (value), Payroll Manager (approve), Employee (view)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want taxable perquisites valued per Rule 3 — especially the concessional/interest-free loan perquisite the system itself creates via FR-08, and employer-provided accommodation — so that TDS is not systematically under-deducted.
- **Description:** Compute and maintain `perquisites` per employee per FY for `CONCESSIONAL_LOAN`/`INTEREST_FREE_LOAN` (reducing-balance × (prescribed reference rate − charged rate)), `RENT_FREE_ACCOMMODATION`/`CONCESSIONAL_ACCOMMODATION` (license-fee method), motor car, and others. Each perquisite's `taxable_value` (and `monthly_value` spread) is **wired into FR-07 taxable income via a `PERQUISITE` category component**, closing the v1 gap where the system computed a concessional loan but never taxed its perquisite.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A concessional/interest-free loan (FR-08 `is_concessional=true`) automatically produces an ACTIVE `perquisites` row valued per Rule 3.
  - AC2: Employer-provided accommodation is valued by the license-fee method.
  - AC3: Each perquisite's `taxable_value` flows into `tax_declarations.perquisite_total` and projected taxable income (data-integrity rule #17).
  - AC4: A change in loan balance/rate or accommodation status revises the perquisite (REVISED) and re-projects TDS.
  - AC5: The perquisite appears on the payslip/tax summary as a non-cash taxable item.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Reference rate (SBI/prescribed) is configurable, effective-dated. BR2: Perquisite is taxable income, not a cash earning; it increases TDS but not net pay. BR3: **Every `is_concessional` loan must have a linked perquisite (enforced).**
- **Data Model References:** `perquisites`, `loans_advances` (`is_concessional`, `perquisite_id`), `tax_declarations` (`perquisite_total`), `pay_components` (PERQUISITE), `payslip_lines`, `rate_tables` (reference rate).

### FR-M10-22 — Cross-Module Point-in-Time Snapshot Contract

- **Module:** M10-F19
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (run), Payroll Manager (oversee), System (automated)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want every run to compute against a frozen, as-of snapshot of upstream facts (M01 employee/bank/PAN/scheme, M03 attendance, M06 fixation, M09 recovery, org unit) so that determinism extends upstream and there is no ambiguity about *who* gets paid *how much* into *which account*.
- **Description:** Defines the snapshot-as-of contract the v1 BRD left silent. At cutoff, the engine captures an immutable `run_input_snapshots` row with the as-of values of all upstream facts and a `checksum`; the run computes only from the snapshot, and `payroll_runs.snapshot_id`/`payslips.snapshot_id` bind it. **Orders arriving after cutoff but before lock are deferred (recorded in `post_cutoff_deferrals`) to the next cycle/arrears — they are not silently in or out.** The snapshot also resolves the **bank account paid** (the snapshotted account, even if M01 changes before disbursement) and the **DDO-of-record for mid-month inter-DDO transfers** (Appendix 16.8).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Starting a FINAL run freezes a `run_input_snapshots` row (`is_frozen=true`) with a checksum; the run binds to it.
  - AC2: Re-running against the same frozen snapshot reproduces identical payslips (data-integrity rule #16).
  - AC3: **The bank account, PAN, scheme, and org unit used are the snapshotted values; a later M01 change does not alter the locked run or its disbursement account.**
  - AC4: **An M06 fixation or M09 recovery order effective ≤ cutoff is included; one arriving after cutoff is recorded in `post_cutoff_deferrals` and applied to the next cycle/arrears.**
  - AC5: **For a mid-month inter-DDO transfer, the DDO-of-record rule determines the payer and control-account attribution (Appendix 16.8).**
- **Business Rules:** BR1: The snapshot is append-only and immutable once frozen. BR2: What-if runs may take a non-frozen snapshot copy for scenarios. BR3: **Determinism is defined as a pure function of (structure version, effective rates, M10 inputs, prior ledger, frozen snapshot).** BR4: Post-cutoff orders are never silently dropped or silently applied.
- **Data Model References:** `run_input_snapshots`, `payroll_runs` (`snapshot_id`), `payslips` (`snapshot_id`), M01/M03/M06/M09/org (read), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/snapshot:freeze` | capture & freeze the as-of snapshot |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/snapshots/{id}` | snapshot facts & checksum |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/snapshots/{id}/deferrals` | post-cutoff deferred orders |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Snapshot panel on the run console: as-of timestamp, checksum, per-source counts (employees, attendance, fixations, recoveries), and a **post-cutoff deferral list** with "carry to next cycle" confirmation.
- **Edge Cases:** Bank account changed in M01 after cutoff (snapshot account paid); fixation order arriving post-cutoff; inter-DDO transfer on cutoff day; M03 regularisation after snapshot.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SnapshotService`, `UpstreamFactCollector` (M01/M03/M06/M09/org clients), `SnapshotChecksum`, `DdoOfRecordResolver` |
| Backend Flow | At cutoff, collect as-of facts → persist immutable snapshot → checksum → freeze → bind to run; record post-cutoff arrivals as deferrals |
| Data Operations | INSERT `run_input_snapshots` (append-only); set `payroll_runs.snapshot_id`, `payslips.snapshot_id` |
| Validation | As-of correctness; immutability after freeze; checksum determinism; deferral capture |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer freeze; Manager oversee; system automated |
| State Changes & Side Effects | snapshot frozen; run bound; deferrals recorded; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Upstream unavailable at freeze → 503 `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`, retry; mutation after freeze → 409 `SNAPSHOT_FROZEN` |
| Dependencies | M01, M03, M06, M09, org; FR-04 |
| Test Guidance | As-of correctness per source; determinism vs frozen snapshot; bank-account-changed case; post-cutoff deferral; inter-DDO DDO-of-record |

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data Migration

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Master data | Load pay scales, pay-matrix levels, DA/HRA/**PT-by-state**/tax tables (effective-dated) |
| Employee structures | Migrate current salary structure per employee with current version + history where available |
| Deduction setup | Migrate GPF/NPS/PT scheme assignments; **seed YTD as a signed-off dataset (not a mutable scalar) reconstructable into the line ledger** |
| Loans | Migrate outstanding loans with amortization remaining and recovered-to-date; **flag concessional loans and seed perquisites** |
| YTD accumulators | Load FY-to-date earnings/deductions/TDS for mid-year cutover as **immutable seed lines** (critical for Form-16 continuity) |
| Benefits | Migrate enrolments, LTC block-year utilisation, gratuity accrual baseline, **leave balances for encashment** |
| Open obligations | Migrate **open carryforwards, suspense holds (if any), and un-deposited statutory liabilities** into the remittance ledger |

### 13.2 Validation & Parallel Run (STRENGTHENED GATE — R18)

- Run a **parallel payroll** for at least 2 cycles vs the legacy system.
- **Gate (must pass before go-live):** reconcile to **zero variance** on (a) per-employee net, (b) **YTD accumulators**, and (c) **per-scheme statutory totals** (TDS/PT/GPF/NPS). Monthly-net-only reconciliation is insufficient.
- The mid-year **YTD seed is a verified, signed-off dataset**; the line-ledger derivation must reproduce the seeded YTD exactly.
- Validate Form-24Q and Form-16 Part A against **MATCHED** remittances before first live filing.

### 13.3 Cutover & Launch

- Freeze legacy; lock migrated balances; run first live cycle in DRAFT, reconcile (incl. disbursed/held/failed), then FINAL.
- Phased rollout by org unit/cohort; self-service (payslip/declaration/FnF) enabled after first successful published cycle.
- Rollback plan: retain legacy read-only; first-cycle abort path defined.

### 13.4 Launch Readiness Checklist

Master data loaded & approved (incl. PT-by-state); structures reconciled; **YTD signed-off seed loaded & ledger-reproduced**; **bank file format certified with bank in test AND DSC/HSM signing path provisioned and tested (a week-1 long-pole — start at project start, not launch)**; **positive-pay reconciliation channel established with treasury**; reconciliation tie-out (incl. disbursed+held+failed) passing; SoD roles assigned; statutory output formats validated against TRACES/CRA; **remittance challan-capture & GL export integration tested**; audit logging & snapshot checksums verified.

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Computation Order (default earning→deduction sequence)

1. BASIC → 2. DA (% basic) → 3. HRA (city-class % basic) → 4. Transport & other allowances → 5. Special pay → 6. **Perquisite (non-cash, taxable-income only)** → 7. Gross earnings → 8. GPF/NPS (% basic / basic+DA) → 9. PT (state slab on gross) → 10. TDS (full pipeline) → 11. Loan recovery → 12. Court attachment/disciplinary recovery (by priority, within s.60 exemption) → 13. Voluntary deductions → 14. **Rounding adjustment** → 15. Net pay (with net-protection re-balancing; shortfall → carryforward).

### 16.2 Rounding & Money Rules

- All amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)`; rates `NUMERIC(9,4)`; no floating point.
- Component rounding per `pay_rules.rounding`; default NEAREST (half-up) to rupee.
- Statutory deductions use their prescribed rounding.
- **A `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` component absorbs `Σ(rounded) − round(Σ)` per payslip so gross/net identities tie to the rupee.**
- **Remittance tolerance:** a documented per-scheme tolerance absorbs the residue of summed per-employee statutory pennies against NSDL-CRA / GPF reconciliation; variance beyond tolerance is an exception, not a silent pass.

### 16.3 Net-Pay Protection, Attachment Exemption & Recovery Priority

- **Protected floor:** a configurable minimum net (by cadre/jurisdiction); deductions cannot push net below it.
- **Court-attachment exemption:** computed independently per CPC s.60 (not the flat floor); the attachable portion is bounded by statute.
- **Priority:** statutory (TDS/PT/GPF/NPS) → court attachment (within s.60 exemption) → disciplinary recovery → overpayment recovery (after legal-eligibility check) → loans → voluntary.
- If net would fall below the floor/exemption, lower-priority recoveries are reduced/deferred and **rolled into `deduction_carryforwards`** (owned, aged), not dropped.

### 16.4 Immutability & Correction Policy

A LOCKED run and its payslips are immutable. Corrections never edit the original; they are issued as: (a) arrears (FR-10) for retrospective entitlement, (b) supplementary/off-cycle (FR-11) for missed/additional payments, (c) recovery (FR-09) for overpayments, or (d) **reopen-with-versioning (FR-16)** pre-transmission, which supersedes the original payslip into a new version with a lock-to-lock diff. Each correction references the original run for traceability; **YTD always derives from the surviving (non-superseded) line ledger.**

### 16.5 Assumptions Log

- Single legal entity per deployment (data model entity-aware for future multi-entity); **PT supports multiple states within the entity.**
- Bank/treasury supports **one documented, certified file format**; the format is shipped, others (ISO20022/CUSTOM) deferred behind a `FileFormatStrategy` seam.
- Enterprise notifications drive rate-table updates; entered by SysAdmin and approved by Payroll Manager.
- 30-day vs actual-days LWP basis is a configurable policy switch.
- **DSC/HSM signing infrastructure and a treasury positive-pay channel are available (week-1 long-pole).**
- **Finance ERP accepts a structured cost-journal export and returns a posting acknowledgement.**

### 16.6 Subsistence Allowance & Dies-Non (NEW — R13)

- **Subsistence (suspended employees):** initial subsistence = configured percentage of pay (default 50% of pay + applicable DA) for the first configured period; escalates by a configured step after N months of continued suspension (default: increase after 3 months and again after 6 months, per rules), subject to authority review. Statutory deductions compute on the subsistence base.
- **Dies-non:** a period declared dies-non yields **no pay and no qualifying service**; it is neither LWP nor leave; it suppresses earnings for those days and is flagged to M12 for the service record.

### 16.7 Formula DSL Semantics & Security (NEW — R14)

- **Grammar versioning:** the DSL grammar carries a `dsl_grammar_version`, versioned independently of `pay_rules.version`; a FORMULA component pins the grammar it was authored against; grammar upgrades re-validate or quarantine existing FORMULA rules.
- **Decimal semantics:** all evaluation uses fixed-point `NUMERIC`; no binary float; rounding per component rule.
- **Null propagation:** any null operand raises a rule exception (never silently treated as 0).
- **Precedence:** explicit, documented operator precedence; ambiguous expressions are rejected at parse time.
- **Whitelist:** only whitelisted operators, functions, component-code references, and employee-attribute references are permitted; no I/O, no loops, no code execution.
- **Concessional-loan perquisite (Rule 3):** perquisite value = reducing monthly outstanding × ((prescribed reference rate − charged rate) / 12), summed over the FY; reference rate is effective-dated master data.
- **Property tests:** decimal rounding, null propagation, precedence, division-by-zero, and circular-reference detection must pass before a FORMULA rule activates.

### 16.8 Mid-Month Inter-DDO Transfer Rule (NEW — R16)

- **Default — DDO-of-record:** the DDO-of-record for the transfer month (the snapshotted DDO at cutoff, or the destination DDO per policy) pays the full month; the control account and bank file attribute to that DDO. This avoids split-payment ambiguity for the common case.
- **Optional — split-period payslip:** where policy requires, the month is split at the transfer date into two payslip segments (source-DDO days and destination-DDO days), each attributed to its DDO's control account, reconciled to the same employee net.
- The chosen mode is a configurable policy; the snapshot (FR-22) records the DDO-of-record so disbursement and control-account attribution are deterministic.

### 16.9 Disbursement Anti-Duplication Protocol (NEW — R1/R2)

1. Each transmission carries a **unique `bank_batch_ref`**; the bank echoes it on ack.
2. Excluded/invalid-account net pay is **parked in `disbursement_holds`** (suspense), preserving `Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net`.
3. On gateway timeout/ambiguous ack the batch enters **`SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`**; **no resend is permitted** until a **positive-pay/treasury-debit reconciliation** confirms the credits did **not** post.
4. A confirmed non-debit allows resend under a **new `bank_batch_ref`**; a confirmed debit moves the batch to RECONCILED.
5. The DSC/HSM signature provides authenticity/non-repudiation; the checksum provides integrity only. The positive-pay confirmer must differ from the transmitter (SoD).
