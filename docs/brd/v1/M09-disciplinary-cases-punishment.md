## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Employee Disciplinary Cases and Punishment Management module (**M09-DCP**) digitises the **end-to-end disciplinary lifecycle** of a public-sector / enterprise employer, from the first receipt of a complaint or detection of misconduct through preliminary inquiry, optional suspension, framing of articles of charge, departmental inquiry, penalty imposition, and statutory appeal / revision / review — concluding with an immutable posting of the outcome (punishment **or** exoneration) into the Digital Service Register (M12).

The module exists to guarantee that **every** disciplinary proceeding satisfies the **principles of natural justice** (audi alteram partem — the right to be heard; nemo judex in causa sua — no one a judge in their own cause), respects **statutory timelines**, preserves a **tamper-evident audit trail**, and produces legally defensible orders that withstand departmental appeal and judicial review.

### 1.2 Business context

Disciplinary action against a employee is a **quasi-judicial** process. A procedural defect — a denied opportunity to defend, an inquiry officer who is also a witness, a charge-sheet served after a barred period, a penalty exceeding what was proposed in the show-cause — routinely results in penalty orders being set aside on appeal or by tribunals/courts, with consequential financial liability (back-wages, restoration of seniority, pension re-computation). Today these cases are run on paper files that are slow, opaque, prone to loss, and impossible to audit at scale.

M09-DCP converts this risk-laden manual process into a **controlled, time-bound, fully audited workflow** with built-in natural-justice safeguards, a sealed evidence vault, and real-time SLA monitoring.

### 1.3 Module objectives

| # | Objective | Measure of success |
|---|-----------|--------------------|
| O1 | Enforce due process and natural justice at every transition | 100% of penalty orders carry a complete, sequential audit chain; 0 stage-skips |
| O2 | Track statutory and internal SLAs per stage | Real-time SLA dashboard; escalation on breach; ≥ 95% of stages closed within SLA |
| O3 | Guarantee confidentiality and integrity of case records | Field-level RBAC, sealed evidence vault, immutable audit_log on every action |
| O4 | Produce legally defensible orders | Each penalty order traces to a served charge, recorded defence, inquiry finding, and (for major penalties) a show-cause |
| O5 | Propagate outcomes to dependent modules accurately | Penalty/exoneration posted to M12 SR; effects flowed to M06 (seniority/promotion), M10 (payroll/subsistence), M11 (pension) |
| O6 | Provide case analytics & vigilance oversight | Caseload, ageing, penalty-mix, appeal-overturn, and vigilance-clearance dashboards |

### 1.4 Scope summary

In scope: complaint intake, preliminary inquiry, suspension & subsistence allowance, charge-sheet (articles of charge / statement of imputations), statement of defence, appointment of Inquiry Officer (IO) & Presenting Officer (PO), conduct of departmental inquiry (witnesses, exhibits, daily order sheets, ex-parte proceedings), inquiry report & findings, disagreement memo, minor/major penalty determination, show-cause on proposed penalty, penalty order & exoneration, appeal / revision / review, SR posting and downstream effects, evidence vault, integrity register, vigilance clearance, SLA tracking, and analytics.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere, integrated here): the SR ledger itself (M12), payroll execution of recoveries/subsistence (M10), pension re-computation engine (M11), seniority list recomputation (M06), the physical document store (M13), and identity/SSO (platform).

### 1.5 Key outcomes

A complete, confidential, time-bound, audit-grade disciplinary case system that an enterprise/enterprise HR organisation can rely on for **defensible** penalty orders, **transparent** ageing, and **accurate** downstream propagation of consequences.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited, applied module-wide)

- **Maker-checker / workflow engine** (`workflow_instances` / `workflow_tasks`) for every stage transition that changes statutory state.
- **Segregation of duties:** maker ≠ checker; the Disciplinary Authority (DA), Inquiry Officer (IO), Presenting Officer (PO), and any witness must be **mutually distinct** persons; no self-approval.
- **Immutable audit** (`audit_log`) on every create/update/transition/view-of-sealed-record.
- **Document handling** via M13 (`documents`) — all artefacts are versioned, encrypted, access-controlled objects referenced by metadata.
- **Notifications** via shared `notifications` ledger (in-app + email + optional SMS).
- **Pagination** on all list endpoints (page/limit, hard max 100).
- **Localisation:** UTC storage, `DD-MMM-YYYY` display, INR money formatting.
- **RBAC + row-level org scoping**, extended in §3 with field-level confidentiality controls.

### 2.3 Boundaries & integration points

| Boundary | Direction | Contract |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| M01-EPM (employees) | read | Charged employee, complainant, IO/PO identity, designation, org_unit, employment_status |
| M12-SR (service_register_events) | write (append-only) | Suspension, penalty, exoneration, appeal outcome events |
| M10-PAY | write (event) | Suspension → subsistence allowance; recovery penalty; pay reduction; promotion/increment withholding |
| M11-PEN | write (event) | Pension cut/withholding flags; effect of removal/dismissal/compulsory retirement on terminal benefits |
| M06-PPP | write (event) | Reduction in rank, withholding of promotion, seniority re-fixation |
| M13-DMS | read/write | Evidence vault objects, charge-sheet PDFs, orders |
| M14-DAS | read | KPI feed for cross-module dashboards |
| Platform | read | Auth/SSO/MFA, roles, org tree |

### 2.4 Explicit non-goals

- M09 does **not** compute payroll, pension, or seniority figures; it emits **events** that the owning module executes.
- M09 does **not** store document binaries; it stores references to M13 objects.
- Criminal prosecution case management (police/court FIR tracking) is **linked** (reference fields) but not executed here.

### 3.3 Field-level confidentiality rules

- The **charged officer** may read **only** artefacts that have been **formally served** on them (charge-sheet, inquiry report copy, show-cause, orders) and never the preliminary inquiry report, vigilance notes, or DA's internal deliberation.
- **Complainant identity** is masked from the charged officer unless the case type mandates disclosure; whistle-blower protection flag (`is_confidential_source`) hard-hides identity from all roles except Vigilance Officer and DA.
- IO/PO cannot view the **vigilance register** scoring or the DA's draft penalty reasoning.
- All reads of sealed/confidential records are logged with `view` audit events (read-audit).

### 5.6 Data integrity rules

1. **DI-1 Stage monotonicity:** `case_stage` may only advance along the state machine (§12); regression requires a `REMITTED`/`DE_NOVO`/appeal event with recorded authority.
2. **DI-2 Distinct actors:** for a given `case_id`, the persons holding DA, IO, PO, and each witness must be **mutually distinct** (DB-enforced via constraint + service check). The charged employee can never be IO/PO/DA on their own case.
3. **DI-3 No penalty without process:** a `penalty_orders` row of `order_type=PENALTY` requires a served `charge_sheet`, a `defence_statements` row (or `is_ex_parte_assumed=true`), and — for `penalty_class=MAJOR` — a concluded `inquiry_reports` and a responded/closed `show_cause_notices`.
4. **DI-4 Show-cause ⊇ order:** penalties in a finalised order must be a **subset** of the penalties proposed in the related show-cause (no enhancement beyond proposed without fresh show-cause).
5. **DI-5 Limitation guard:** `appeals.is_time_barred` is computed from `limitation_due_date`; a time-barred appeal can be `ADMITTED` only if `condonation_granted=true`.
6. **DI-6 Immutability after finalise:** once `penalty_orders.status` ∈ {FINALISED, SERVED}, the order and its `penalty_items` are read-only; changes only via appeal/revision producing a new `revised_order_id`.
7. **DI-7 Evidence seal:** every `inquiry_exhibits`/`case_documents` row stores `content_hash`; mismatch on read raises `EVIDENCE_TAMPERED`.
8. **DI-8 Subsistence floor/ceiling:** `subsistence_rate_pct` ∈ [25, 75]; must be reviewed before `subsistence_revision_due`.
9. **DI-9 Confidentiality:** rows with `is_confidential_source=true` never expose complainant identity outside Vigilance Officer/DA, including in API responses and exports.
10. **DI-10 SR posting once:** at most one non-superseded `service_register_events` per finalised order; supersession only via appeal outcome.
11. **DI-11 Referential integrity:** all FKs enforced; soft-deleted parents block new children.
12. **DI-12 Append-only ledgers:** `case_timeline_events` and `audit_log` are insert-only; no update/delete.

### FR-M09-001 — Complaint / Source-of-Misconduct Registration & Triage

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Complainant, Vigilance Officer, DCP Admin, Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As a Vigilance Officer, I want to register and triage every complaint or detected source of misconduct so that only substantiated matters proceed to a formal case while all sources remain auditable.

**Description:** Captures complaints from internal, public, anonymous, audit, media, CVC, or suo-motu sources, deduplicates against existing cases for the same subject, and supports a triage decision (file case / order preliminary inquiry / close with no action / transfer to another agency). Anonymous and whistle-blower sources are handled with identity protection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A complaint can be registered with a unique `complaint_no` and a mandatory `allegation_summary` and `subject_employee_id` (or external subject reference).
2. Anonymous complaints are accepted with `complainant_id` null and `is_anonymous=true`; whistle-blower flag hides identity per DI-9.
3. The system surfaces existing open cases/complaints for the same subject before allowing a new case (duplicate guard).
4. Triage records a `triage_decision`, `triaged_by`, `triaged_at`, and remarks; `FILE_CASE` creates a `disciplinary_cases` row in `OPEN`/`INTAKE`.
5. Every action writes to `audit_log` and a `case_timeline_events` entry once a case exists.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Only Vigilance Officer or DA may set `triage_decision`.
- BR-2: `CLOSE_NO_ACTION` requires remarks and DA concurrence for vigilance-flagged complaints.
- BR-3: Promotion to a case requires a competent `disciplinary_authority_id` resolvable from org hierarchy.

### FR-M09-002 — Preliminary (Fact-Finding) Inquiry

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, Vigilance Officer, PI Officer, DCP Admin

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to order a preliminary inquiry so that I can decide, on facts, whether formal charges are warranted and on which track.

**Description:** Orders a confidential fact-finding inquiry, assigns a PI officer, tracks an SLA, and records findings with a recommendation (proceed major/minor, drop, administrative advice). The PI report is confidential and never served on the subject.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. DA/Vigilance can order a PI with `pi_officer_id`, `ordered_date`, and `due_date`.
2. PI status transitions ORDERED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → CLOSED.
3. On submission a `recommendation` and confidential `report_document_id` are required.
4. PI report is stored with `is_served=false` and excluded from the charged officer's view (DI-9/§3.3).
5. SLA breach raises a timeline `SLA_BREACH` + escalation notification.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: PI officer ≠ subject; PI officer should not later be IO on the same case (warn + override-with-reason).
- BR-2: `DROP` recommendation requires DA approval and closes the case with `DROPPED` if no charges.
- BR-3: PI is optional for clear-cut minor matters (skippable to charge).

**UI Behavior Notes:** PI order modal; officer picker excluding the subject; SLA countdown chip; confidential report uploader; recommendation selector gated to submission.

**Edge Cases:** PI officer recuses (reassign); evidence suggests criminal angle (set `criminal_case_ref`, route TRANSFER_AGENCY); PI exceeds SLA (auto-escalation to higher authority).

### FR-M09-003 — Suspension, Subsistence Allowance & Review

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin, Payroll Officer (downstream)

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to place an employee under suspension (or record deemed suspension) and manage subsistence allowance so that interim action is lawful, payroll-correct, and periodically reviewed.

**Description:** Issues suspension orders (ordered/deemed/continued), sets subsistence rate within statutory bounds, schedules mandatory periodic review, emits a payroll event to M10, and supports revocation with effect on employment status and back-pay treatment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A suspension order sets `effective_from`, `subsistence_rate_pct` ∈ [25,75], and updates `employees.employment_status=SUSPENDED` (via M01 event).
2. Deemed suspension auto-creates a record when detention > 48h is recorded.
3. A subsistence review task is scheduled before `subsistence_revision_due` (default 90 days) and a review-board task before `review_committee_due` (default 180 days).
4. Revocation sets `status=REVOKED`, `effective_to`, and emits M10 + M01 events to restore status and settle pay.
5. An SR event is appended for suspension and revocation (FR-013).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Subsistence rate may be revised after review but enhancement beyond 75% / reduction below 25% is blocked (DI-8).
- BR-2: Suspension during inquiry cannot exceed configured limit without documented extension.
- BR-3: Period of suspension's treatment (duty/non-duty) is decided at final order, not at revocation.

**UI Behavior Notes:** Suspension order form with rate slider bounded 25–75%; review-due reminders on case header; revocation drawer with reason + pay-treatment note.

**Edge Cases:** Employee retires during suspension (convert to charge-after-retirement/pension path); deemed suspension where detention later quashed; subsistence not revised in time (auto AT_RISK then escalation).

### FR-M09-004 — Charge-Sheet / Articles of Charge (Statement of Imputations)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin, Presenting Officer (draft)

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to frame and serve a charge-sheet with distinct articles of charge and statements of imputation so that the employee knows precisely what they must answer.

**Description:** Builds a memorandum of charges containing one or more articles, each with charge text, statement of imputation, and the conduct rule violated; selects penalty track (minor/major); generates a signed PDF (M13); records valid service with mode and computes the statutory defence-reply window.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A charge-sheet requires at least one `charge_articles` row; each article requires text, imputation, and rule.
2. Penalty track (MINOR/MAJOR) determines downstream path (minor track may skip oral inquiry).
3. On issue, a signed PDF is produced and stored; `status=ISSUED`.
4. Service recording captures `service_mode`, `served_date`, and computes `defence_due_date` (config window, default 15 days; substituted service rules apply).
5. The served charge-sheet is visible to the charged officer (`is_served=true`).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: A charge-sheet cannot be served before any active suspension review obligations are satisfied (warn-only).
- BR-2: Withdrawal requires reason and DA approval; a withdrawn sheet cannot host an inquiry.
- BR-3: Articles must be uniquely numbered and immutable after service (amendment ⇒ supplementary charge-sheet).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Article builder (repeatable rows), rule-violated lookup, track selector, PDF preview, service-recording panel with mode + date and auto-computed reply due-date.

**Edge Cases:** Substituted/published service when employee absconds; supplementary charges after inquiry begins (de novo or addendum); multilingual charge-sheet rendering.

### FR-M09-005 — Employee's Written Statement of Defence

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Charged Officer), DCP Admin

**User Story:** As a charged officer, I want to submit my written statement of defence (admitting or denying charges and requesting an oral inquiry/defence assistant) so that my side is on record before any inquiry.

**Description:** Self-service submission of the defence, recording plea (admits/denies/partial), free-text statement, requests for oral inquiry and a defence assistant, and optional extension request. If no response within the window, an ex-parte assumption is recorded.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The charged officer can submit a defence against a served charge-sheet before `defence_due_date`.
2. Plea selection is mandatory; partial admissions can be article-wise.
3. Requesting an oral inquiry forces the major-track inquiry path even if minor track was initially chosen (escalation logged).
4. If `defence_due_date` passes with no submission, `is_ex_parte_assumed=true` is set automatically.
5. An extension request routes to DA for approval and, if granted, updates `defence_due_date`.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Defence editable until submitted; immutable thereafter (corrigendum via new statement).
- BR-2: ADMITS_ALL on minor track allows DA to proceed directly to penalty without inquiry (still requires speaking order).
- BR-3: Only the charged officer (or authorised assistant) may submit.

**UI Behavior Notes:** Charged-officer portal showing only served documents; plea radio per article; statement editor; checkboxes for oral inquiry / defence assistant; due-date countdown; locked after submit.

**Edge Cases:** Employee on leave/hospitalised (extension); ex-parte then late submission (DA discretion to admit); employee disputes valid service (raises objection record).

### FR-M09-006 — Appointment of Inquiry Officer & Presenting Officer

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to appoint an impartial Inquiry Officer and a Presenting Officer (and permit a defence assistant) so that the departmental inquiry is conducted fairly and at arm's length.

**Description:** Appoints IO and PO for an inquiry, enforcing distinct-actor and conflict-of-interest rules, supports recusal/objection handling and replacement, and permits the charged officer to nominate a defence assistant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. IO, PO, DA, and the charged officer must be mutually distinct (DI-2); violations are blocked.
2. The charged officer may raise a bias objection against the IO; the DA records a reasoned decision (uphold ⇒ replace).
3. Replacement preserves the appointment history (old row `REPLACED`, new row `ACTIVE`).
4. A defence assistant nomination is recorded subject to eligibility rules.
5. Appointment notifications are sent to all parties.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: IO should not have been the PI officer or a witness (hard block on witness; warn on PI officer).
- BR-2: External IO permitted only when configured for the case type.
- BR-3: At most one ACTIVE IO and one ACTIVE PO per inquiry.

### FR-M09-007 — Conduct of Departmental Inquiry (Hearings, Witnesses, Exhibits, Daily Order Sheets, Ex-Parte)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Inquiry Officer, Presenting Officer, Charged Officer / Defence Assistant

**User Story:** As an Inquiry Officer, I want to schedule and record hearings, examine witnesses, admit exhibits, and maintain daily order sheets so that the inquiry is complete, fair, and fully documented.

**Description:** Runs the oral inquiry: schedules hearings, logs daily order sheets, manages prosecution/defence witnesses (examination, cross-examination), admits exhibits into the sealed evidence vault, records adjournments, and handles ex-parte proceedings when the charged officer fails to participate after due notice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The IO can schedule a hearing with date, record outcome (held/adjourned/no-show/ex-parte), and a mandatory daily order text.
2. Witnesses (both sides) can be listed and their depositions recorded with examination status.
3. Exhibits are added with a marker, side, description, sealed document reference, and `content_hash` (DI-7).
4. Ex-parte: after a configured number of no-shows with proof of notice, the IO may set the inquiry `EX_PARTE` with a recorded order.
5. Every hearing, witness, and exhibit action writes to `audit_log` and updates the timeline.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Charged officer must be given a fair opportunity to cross-examine; ex-parte requires documented notice (natural justice).
- BR-2: Exhibits cannot be deleted once admitted (only marked objected); seal is immutable.
- BR-3: Hearing scheduling respects reasonable-notice config (e.g. ≥ 7 days unless waived).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Inquiry workbench with hearing calendar, daily-order-sheet editor, witness register with examine/cross tabs, exhibit list with seal indicator, ex-parte action gated on no-show count.

**Edge Cases:** Witness turns hostile; exhibit authenticity challenged (objection recorded, IO rules); charged officer attends late after ex-parte set (IO may recall in interest of justice); document hash mismatch ⇒ `EVIDENCE_TAMPERED`.

### FR-M09-008 — Inquiry Report & Findings

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Inquiry Officer, Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As an Inquiry Officer, I want to submit a reasoned inquiry report with article-wise findings so that the Disciplinary Authority can decide on the basis of evidence.

**Description:** The IO records article-wise findings (proved/not proved/partly proved) with reasoning, an overall finding, and a signed report (M13). A copy is served on the charged officer for representation before the DA considers it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The IO must record a finding for **every** article before submitting.
2. The report requires `analysis_text` and a signed `report_document_id`.
3. On submission the inquiry is `CONCLUDED` and the case moves to `DA_CONSIDERATION`.
4. A copy of the report is served on the charged officer (`served_on_charged_date`) with a representation window.
5. Findings write back to `charge_articles.finding`.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: A report cannot be submitted for an inquiry that is not IN_PROGRESS/EX_PARTE.
- BR-2: Findings must be supported by recorded evidence (advisory completeness check, not a hard block).
- BR-3: The DA may remit the report for further inquiry (`REMITTED`) with reasons (→ de novo or supplementary).

### FR-M09-009 — Disagreement Memo & Disciplinary Authority Consideration

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, Charged Officer

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, when I disagree with the IO's findings, I want to issue a disagreement memo and give the charged officer a chance to represent so that my differing view is procedurally valid.

**Description:** Records the DA's consideration of the inquiry report; where the DA disagrees with any finding (especially upgrading not-proved to proved), a disagreement memo with tentative reasons is served on the charged officer, who may respond before finalisation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The DA can accept the report (→ show-cause/penalty path) or record a disagreement memo.
2. A disagreement memo requires `tentative_disagreement` reasons and `articles_affected_json`.
3. The memo is served with a representation window; the charged officer's response is recorded.
4. Final consideration after representation moves the case forward (`FINALISED`).
5. Disagreement that upgrades a finding to "proved" must be served before any penalty (natural justice).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: The DA cannot impose a penalty on a not-proved article without first serving a disagreement memo and considering the representation.
- BR-2: Memo immutable after serve; further changes via new memo.
- BR-3: If the DA agrees fully with not-proved on all articles ⇒ exoneration path (FR-011).

### FR-M09-010 — Show-Cause Notice on Proposed Penalty

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, Charged Officer

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to issue a show-cause notice setting out the penalty I propose so that the employee can represent before I finalise it.

**Description:** Issues a show-cause notice with the tentatively proposed penalty(ies) on the major-penalty track (or where enhancement is contemplated), records service and the employee's representation, and constrains the final order to the proposed set (DI-4).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A show-cause notice records `proposed_penalty_json`, issue/serve dates, and a `response_due_date`.
2. The charged officer's representation is recorded (or `NO_RESPONSE` on lapse).
3. The final penalty order's penalties must be a subset of the proposed penalties (DI-4); enhancement requires a fresh show-cause.
4. Major-track penalties cannot be finalised without a closed show-cause (DI-3).
5. Notice and representation are audited and timelined.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Minor-penalty track does not require a separate show-cause (charge-sheet already invites cause), per config.
- BR-2: Proposed penalty must be a recognised `penalty_type` valid for the case (class compatibility).
- BR-3: Notice immutable after serve.

### FR-M09-011 — Penalty Order & Exoneration

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to pass a reasoned final order — imposing penalties, exonerating, or dropping proceedings — so that the case concludes lawfully with clear downstream effects.

**Description:** Produces the final speaking order. For penalties, it records one or more `penalty_items` (minor/major) with their parameters (duration, recovery amount, reduction target, pension effect); for exoneration, it clears the employee. The order is finalised, served, and made immutable (DI-6), then posted to the SR (FR-013).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. An order requires `reasoning_text` and `is_speaking_order=true` to finalise.
2. Penalty order requires the full due-process chain (DI-3) and subset constraint (DI-4).
3. Each `penalty_items` row sets parameters appropriate to its `penalty_type` (e.g. recovery requires `recovery_amount`; reduction requires `reduction_to_designation_id`).
4. On finalise, the order and items become read-only (DI-6); an SR posting is triggered (FR-013).
5. Exoneration sets case `EXONERATED`, restores `employment_status` (if suspended), and clears vigilance status.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Major penalties (reduction/CR/removal/dismissal) require step-up MFA and competent-authority verification.
- BR-2: Penalty effective date defaults to service date unless lawfully retrospective with reasons.
- BR-3: Period-of-suspension treatment (duty/non-duty/back-pay) is decided in this order.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `penalty_orders` | create/finalise |
| `penalty_items` | penalties |

| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/orders/{id}/finalise` | Finalise (immutable) |
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/orders/{id}/serve` | Record service |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Order composer with penalty-item builder (type-driven dynamic fields), reasoning editor, speaking-order checklist, finalise with MFA, serve panel.

**Edge Cases:** Multiple penalties of different classes; recovery exceeding recoverable limit (validation); exoneration after long suspension (back-pay settlement event to M10); employee deceased before order (abate proceedings).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `OrderComposer`, `PenaltyItemBuilder`, `FinaliseDialog`; `PenaltyOrderService`, `DownstreamEffectEmitter` |

| Validation | DI-3, DI-4, DI-6; type-specific parameter checks; speaking order required |
| Authorization | DA only; step-up MFA for major |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Case → `PENALTY_IMPOSED`/`EXONERATED`/`DROPPED`; immutability; downstream effects; vigilance update |

### FR-M09-012 — Appeal / Revision / Review

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Charged Officer, Appellate Authority, Reviewing/Revising Authority

**User Story:** As a penalised employee, I want to appeal the order within the statutory limitation; and as an appellate/reviewing authority, I want to decide the appeal so that errors are corrected and outcomes propagate.

**Description:** Manages post-order remedies — appeal (by employee), revision, and suo-motu review — with limitation tracking, condonation of delay, decision recording (upheld/set-aside/modified/enhanced/remitted/rejected), and generation of a revised order where applicable. Enhancement on appeal requires a fresh show-cause.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. An appeal can be filed against a finalised/served order; `limitation_due_date` computed from config (default 45 days).
2. Late appeals are flagged `is_time_barred`; admission requires `condonation_granted=true`.
3. The authority records a decision with reasoning; `MODIFIED` creates a `revised_order_id`.
4. `ENHANCED` requires a fresh show-cause to the employee before finalisation (natural justice).
5. Decision propagates: SR supersession (FR-013) and downstream effect reversal/adjustment (M06/M10/M11).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Appeal authority ≠ DA who passed the order (segregation).
- BR-2: One pending appeal per order at a time; revision/review may follow.
- BR-3: `SET_ASIDE` restores prior status and reverses downstream effects.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `appeals` | create/decide |
| `penalty_orders` | challenged/revised |
| `service_register_events` | supersession |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/orders/{orderId}/appeals` | File appeal/revision/review |
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/appeals/{id}/admit` | Admit (with condonation) |
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/appeals/{id}/decide` | Record decision |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Appeal-filing form with limitation indicator; authority decision screen with decision selector and revised-order link; enhancement triggers show-cause sub-flow.

**Edge Cases:** Time-barred without condonation (reject); enhancement without show-cause (block); multiple remedies in sequence; appeal pending while recovery already deducted (hold/refund coordination with M10).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `AppealForm`, `AppealDecisionScreen`; `AppealService`, `OrderRevisionService` |
| Backend Flow | Compute limitation → file → admit (condonation guard) → decide → on MODIFIED create revised order, on ENHANCED require fresh show-cause → propagate SR + downstream |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `appeals`; conditional INSERT revised `penalty_orders`; INSERT superseding `service_register_events` |
| Validation | DI-5 limitation; authority ≠ DA; enhancement ⇒ show-cause exists |
| Authorization | File: charged officer; decide: Appellate/Reviewing authority; step-up MFA |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Case → `UNDER_APPEAL` then resolved; downstream reversal/adjustment |
| Failure Handling | Time-barred admit ⇒ 409 `APPEAL_TIME_BARRED`; enhance without show-cause ⇒ 409 |
| Dependencies | M06, M10, M11, M12, MFA |
| Test Guidance | Limitation/condonation; set-aside reversal; enhancement guard |

### FR-M09-013 — Service Register Posting & Downstream Effects

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin, SR Custodian (M12)

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want every concluded outcome posted to the Digital Service Register and propagated to payroll, seniority, and pension so that the employee's statutory record and entitlements reflect the decision accurately.

**Description:** Appends an immutable SR event (suspension, penalty, exoneration, appeal outcome) to M12 and emits idempotent effect events to M06 (seniority/promotion), M10 (payroll/recovery/subsistence), and M11 (pension). Uses an outbox/retry pattern for reliability and supports supersession when appeals modify outcomes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On order finalise (and appeal decision), an SR event is appended with order reference (DI-10 — at most one non-superseded per outcome).
2. Penalty-type-specific downstream events are emitted: WITHHOLD_INCREMENT/REDUCTION → M06+M10; RECOVERY → M10; CR/REMOVAL/DISMISSAL → M11; WITHHOLD_PROMOTION → M06.
3. Emission is idempotent and uses an outbox; failures retry without duplicating effects.
4. Appeal `SET_ASIDE`/`MODIFIED` posts a superseding SR event and reversal/adjustment events.
5. Downstream correlation IDs are stored (`downstream_event_id`, `sr_event_id`).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: SR events are append-only and never edited (supersession only).
- BR-2: Effects are emitted only after order finalisation/serve (not on draft).
- BR-3: Cross-module failures must not roll back the legally valid order (eventual consistency via outbox).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `service_register_events` | append (M12) |
| `penalty_orders` / `penalty_items` | source + correlation |
| `appeals` | supersession source |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/orders/{id}/post-to-sr` | Trigger SR posting (idempotent) |
| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/orders/{id}/downstream-status` | View propagation status |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Propagation status panel on the order showing SR event id and per-module effect status (queued/done/failed-retry); manual re-trigger for stuck items.

**Edge Cases:** M12 unavailable (outbox retains, retries); duplicate trigger (idempotency key dedup); partial downstream success (per-effect status); reduction-in-rank target designation invalid (validation before emit).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `PropagationStatusPanel`; `SrPostingService`, `OutboxDispatcher`, `EffectMapper` |
| Backend Flow | On finalise → write outbox entries (SR + per-effect) with idempotency keys → dispatcher posts to M12/M06/M10/M11 → record correlation ids → update statuses |
| Data Operations | INSERT `service_register_events`; INSERT outbox rows; UPDATE `penalty_orders.sr_event_id`, `penalty_items.downstream_event_id` |
| Validation | Effect mapping completeness; idempotency key uniqueness; target refs valid |
| Authorization | DA/Admin trigger; system dispatcher service-account |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Case → `SR_POSTING`→`CLOSED`; SR ledger appended; downstream effects executed by owners |
| Failure Handling | Upstream down ⇒ retain outbox, exponential backoff, alert; duplicate ⇒ ignore via key |

### FR-M09-014 — Document Evidence Vault (Link to M13)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** IO, PO, DCP Admin, DA, Auditor (read)

**User Story:** As an Inquiry Officer, I want a sealed, tamper-evident evidence vault for all case artefacts so that the integrity and confidentiality of evidence are guaranteed and provable.

**Description:** Centralises all case artefacts (complaints, PI reports, charge-sheets, defences, exhibits, inquiry reports, notices, orders, appeals) as references to encrypted M13 objects, each with a SHA-256 `content_hash`, served/sealed flags, and full read-audit. Served items are visible to the charged officer; sealed items are restricted.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every artefact upload creates a `case_documents` link with `artefact_type`, `document_id`, `content_hash`, and served/sealed flags.
2. Reads of sealed documents are recorded as `view` audit events.
3. On retrieval, the stored `content_hash` is re-verified; mismatch raises `EVIDENCE_TAMPERED` and alerts.
4. The charged officer can list/download only `is_served=true` artefacts.
5. Vault listing is filterable by artefact type and paginated.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Vault items are never hard-deleted; supersession/versioning via M13.
- BR-2: Sealing is irreversible without DA authorisation and audit.
- BR-3: Confidential-source artefacts inherit DI-9 masking.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `case_documents` | links |
| `inquiry_exhibits` | exhibit subset |
| `documents` (M13) | binaries |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/cases/{caseId}/documents` | Add artefact link |
| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/cases/{caseId}/documents` | List vault (RBAC-filtered) |
| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/documents/{id}/download` | Download (hash-verified, audited) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Vault explorer grouped by artefact type; seal/served badges; integrity-verified indicator; charged-officer view shows only served items.

**Edge Cases:** Large evidence files (chunked upload via M13); hash mismatch (block + alert); cross-case shared exhibit (separate links, no sharing of confidentiality scope).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `EvidenceVaultExplorer`, `IntegrityBadge`; `CaseDocumentService`, `HashVerifier` |
| Backend Flow | Upload via M13 → compute hash → persist link → on download verify hash + RBAC + write view-audit |
| Data Operations | INSERT `case_documents`; SELECT with RBAC filter; INSERT `audit_log`(view) |
| Validation | artefact_type enum; hash present; served/sealed rules |
| Authorization | RBAC + field-level served visibility; sealed restricted |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Read-audit on sealed access; alert on tamper |
| Failure Handling | M13 down ⇒ 503; hash mismatch ⇒ 409 `EVIDENCE_TAMPERED` |
| Dependencies | M13, audit |
| Test Guidance | Hash verify; served-only visibility; read-audit on sealed |

### FR-M09-015 — Integrity Register & Vigilance Clearance

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Vigilance Officer, DA, HR (consumers across modules)

**User Story:** As a Vigilance Officer, I want to maintain each employee's integrity grade and vigilance clearance status so that promotions, deputations, retirements, and empanelment decisions can be gated on a reliable clearance signal.

**Description:** Maintains a per-employee vigilance record reflecting clearance status (clear / withheld / under-proceedings / not-clear) and integrity grade, automatically driven by case lifecycle (e.g. set UNDER_PROCEEDINGS on charge, CLEAR on exoneration), and exposes a clearance API consumed by M06/M11 and others.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Filing/charging a case sets `clearance_status=UNDER_PROCEEDINGS`; exoneration sets `CLEAR`.
2. A penalty may set `integrity_grade=DOUBTFUL` for a configured period.
3. A clearance lookup API returns current status with validity window for any employee (RBAC-gated).
4. Manual override by Vigilance Officer is allowed with mandatory reason and audit.
5. All status changes write `audit_log` and an effective-dated history.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Clearance status transitions are driven by case events but can be manually overridden by Vigilance Officer only.
- BR-2: `NOT_CLEAR`/`UNDER_PROCEEDINGS` blocks promotion in M06 (advisory gate enforced by M06).
- BR-3: Status has validity dates; expired DOUBTFUL grade auto-reverts to SATISFACTORY review.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `vigilance_records` | create/update |
| `disciplinary_cases` | event source |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/vigilance/{employeeId}` | Clearance lookup |
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/vigilance/{employeeId}` | Update/override status |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Vigilance register grid with status chips and validity; employee clearance card; override drawer with reason.

**Edge Cases:** Multiple concurrent cases (most-restrictive status wins); clearance requested during pending appeal (UNDER_PROCEEDINGS retained); retiring employee clearance for pension (M11 consumes).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `VigilanceRegister`, `ClearanceCard`, `OverrideDrawer`; `VigilanceService` |
| Backend Flow | Subscribe to case events → derive status (most-restrictive) → upsert effective-dated record → serve clearance API |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `vigilance_records` (effective-dated); INSERT `audit_log` |
| Validation | Override requires reason + Vigilance role; validity window consistency |
| Authorization | Read: RBAC (M06/M11 service + Vigilance/DA); write: Vigilance Officer |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Status drives M06 promotion gate, M11 pension clearance |
| Failure Handling | Conflicting concurrent updates ⇒ most-restrictive resolver; 409 on stale write |
| Dependencies | M06, M11, audit |
| Test Guidance | Event-driven derivation; most-restrictive; override audit |

### FR-M09-016 — SLA / Statutory-Timeline Tracking & Case Analytics

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** DCP Admin, DA, Vigilance Officer, Auditor

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Case Manager, I want each stage tracked against statutory/internal SLAs with escalation, and a case-analytics dashboard, so that proceedings are timely and oversight is data-driven.

**Description:** Computes per-stage SLA targets from a configurable matrix, records timeline events, raises AT_RISK/BREACHED states with escalation notifications, and powers analytics: caseload, ageing buckets, stage bottlenecks, penalty mix, exoneration rate, appeal-overturn rate, and average cycle time — feeding M14.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On entering each stage, an `sla_target_at` is computed from the SLA matrix and a `STAGE_ENTERED` timeline event written.
2. A scheduled evaluator marks `AT_RISK` (configurable threshold, e.g. 80% elapsed) and `BREACHED` on overrun, emitting escalation notifications.
3. The analytics endpoint returns aggregated KPIs with filters (org_unit, case_type, date range) and pagination on detail lists.
4. Ageing buckets (e.g. 0–30/31–90/91–180/180+ days) are computed per open case.
5. Timeline is append-only and immutable (DI-12).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: SLA matrix is admin-configurable per stage and case_type; statutory minimums cannot be shortened below config floor.
- BR-2: Breach escalations route up the authority hierarchy.
- BR-3: Analytics respect confidentiality (no PII leakage; aggregates only for non-privileged viewers).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `case_timeline_events` | SLA events |
| `disciplinary_cases` | stage/expected_closure |
| (config) SLA matrix | reference |

**API References:**

| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/analytics/summary` | KPI aggregates |
| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/analytics/ageing` | Ageing buckets |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Case header SLA ribbon (on-track/at-risk/breached); analytics dashboard with KPI tiles, ageing chart, bottleneck-by-stage chart, penalty-mix and overturn-rate visuals; export.

**Edge Cases:** Stage re-entry after remit/appeal (new SLA window, prior timeline preserved); paused clock during stays (SLA pause flag); time-zone-correct elapsed computation.

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `SLARibbon`, `AnalyticsDashboard`, `AgeingChart`; `SlaEngine`, `AnalyticsService` |
| Backend Flow | On stage transition compute target + write event → scheduled evaluator updates sla_status + escalates → analytics aggregates via read-model/materialised view |
| Data Operations | INSERT `case_timeline_events`; SELECT aggregates (materialised view); INSERT `notifications` on breach |
| Validation | Config floor respected; pause flag handling; bucket boundaries |
| Authorization | Detail: DA/Admin/Vigilance; aggregates: Auditor; M14 service-account |
| State Changes & Side Effects | sla_status updates; escalation notifications; M14 feed |
| Failure Handling | Evaluator job failure ⇒ retry + alert; stale read-model ⇒ refresh |

### 7.2 Cross-cutting UI rules

- Real fields, real data, real states — no skeleton placeholders. Every screen defines **empty / loading / error / success / permission-denied / offline** states.
- WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, focus order, contrast, ARIA labels on all interactive controls.
- Confidentiality: charged-officer views render **only** served artefacts; masked complainant identity where flagged.
- Destructive/finalising actions (finalise order, declare ex-parte, post to SR) use confirm dialogs and step-up MFA where specified.
- Dates display `DD-MMM-YYYY`; money in INR; all timestamps localised from UTC.
- All lists paginated (max 100/page) with server-side filter/sort.

---

## 8. (Reserved — merged into §6 LLDs)

*Low-Level Design is provided inline per FR in §6 as required by the authoring standard.*

## 10. API & Integration

### 10.1 Conventions

- Base path `/api/v1/dcp`; JSON; OIDC JWT bearer; RBAC + row-level + field-level enforcement.
- All list endpoints paginated: `?page=&limit=` (max 100), returning `{ data, page, limit, total }`.
- Idempotency: state-changing posts that propagate (suspension, finalise, post-to-sr) accept an `Idempotency-Key` header.

### 10.2 Canonical error envelope

## 15. Migration & Launch

### 15.1 Data migration

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| M-1 | Inventory legacy disciplinary files (paper/legacy DB); classify by stage |
| M-2 | Map legacy statuses → `case_status`/`case_stage`; reference-data load (penalties, SLA matrix, conduct rules) |
| M-3 | Migrate open cases with current stage + key artefacts (scanned to M13 with hashes); closed cases as historical records |
| M-4 | Reconstruct timeline events where dates known; mark unknowns `N_A` |
| M-5 | Link suspensions/penalties to existing M10/M11/M06 effects without re-triggering (migration flag suppresses re-emit) |
| M-6 | Reconciliation report: counts by status, orphan checks, hash verification |

### 15.2 Cutover & launch

- Dual-run period: new intake on M09; legacy frozen read-only.
- Idempotency/migration flag prevents duplicate downstream effects during backfill.
- Pilot with one department; validate due-process guards and SR posting before org-wide rollout.
- Rollback plan: migration is additive; legacy retained until sign-off.

### 15.3 Launch readiness checklist

- RBAC + field-level confidentiality verified; step-up MFA active.
- SLA matrix and reference data loaded and approved.
- Integration smoke tests with M06/M10/M11/M12/M13 green.
- Audit/append-only ledgers verified immutable.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and confidentiality views validated.

### Appendix C — Confidentiality classification

| Artefact | Default visibility |
|----------|--------------------|
| Complaint (confidential source) | Vigilance, DA only |
| Preliminary inquiry report | DA, Vigilance, Admin (never charged officer) |
| Charge-sheet | Served → charged officer |
| Inquiry report copy | Served → charged officer |
| Show-cause / orders | Served → charged officer |
| Sealed exhibits | IO, PO, DA, Auditor; charged officer per admission |
| Vigilance scoring/DA deliberation | DA, Vigilance only |

### Appendix D — Assumptions & caveats

- Statutory windows (defence reply, limitation, subsistence review) are seeded as defaults and **configurable** to the deploying jurisdiction's rules; the engine enforces a non-shortenable statutory floor.
- Exact penalty taxonomy and authority hierarchy are reference data resolved from org configuration (M01/org_units) and the conduct-rules master.
- Criminal-proceeding linkage is reference-only; integration with external court/police systems is out of scope for v1.
