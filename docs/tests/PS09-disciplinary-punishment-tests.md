# PS09 — Disciplinary Cases and Punishment — Acceptance & E2E Test Suite

## 1. Header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | PS09 — Disciplinary Cases and Punishment Management (DCP) |
| Version under test | API 3.0.0 (OpenAPI `docs/contracts/openapi/PS09.yaml`), BRD v3 (`docs/brd/v3/PS09-disciplinary-cases-punishment.md`) |
| Scope | Full statutory due-process engine: complaint → preliminary inquiry → suspension (+subsistence) → charge-sheet → defence → inquiry (IO/PO/witnesses/evidence/daily-order-sheets) → inquiry report → disagreement memo → show-cause → penalty/exoneration → appeal. Plus natural-justice safeguards, SoD, statutory timelines & SLA pause/resume, minor vs major penalty, authority competence, dispense-with-inquiry, personal hearing, sealed cover, multi-respondent, POSH/ICC, retiree/abatement, hash-chained audit, and the E2E SR posting to `/sr/ingest` with downstream effects to PS06/PS10/PS11. |
| Out of scope | Internal implementation of PS12 SR ledger, PS06/PS10/PS11 execution logic (asserted only at the PS09 emission boundary / by reference), P01 workflow engine internals, P02/P05 platform internals (asserted via observable behaviour). |
| Traceability | Every TC declares `Traces-to` = FR-PS09-NNN and/or the acceptance criterion / DI integrity rule (DI-1…DI-29) / state-machine transition / ERR-PS09-* code / auth-matrix action it exercises. Section 3 gives the FR→TC matrix (0 gaps). |

### 1.1 Test environment & data assumptions

- **Multi-tenant.** All requests carry a bearer token bound to a tenant (`org`/department scope). Row-level scoping (P02) applies: cases, documents, and vault items are visible only within the actor's authorised scope; `403`/`404` never leak the existence of out-of-scope records (P02 scope-safety).
- **Platform API conventions (Foundation §4).** Bearer auth; `X-Correlation-Id` present on every response; cursor pagination (`limit` default 25 / max 100, `cursor` → `next_cursor`); `Idempotency-Key` header on state-changing POSTs (24h replay), **required** on the propagating actions SUSPENSION order, ORDER finalise, POST_TO_SR, and APPEAL decide; canonical error envelope `{ error: { code, message, correlation_id, field? } }`.
- **Wire-code mapping** (error-taxonomy §2): VALIDATION_FAILED=422, UNAUTHENTICATED=401, FORBIDDEN=403, NOT_FOUND=404, CONFLICT=409, PRECONDITION_FAILED=412, RATE_LIMITED=429, INTERNAL=500. Every ERR-PS09-* asserted below resolves to exactly one of these.
- **Personas / roles** (auth-matrix PS09): `disciplinary_authority` (DA — MFA), `inquiry_officer` (IO), `presenting_officer` (PO), `appellate_authority`, `vigilance_officer` (VO), `icc_presiding`, `icc_member`, `sr_custodian`, plus `employee` (charged officer) and a `defence_assistant`. SoD invariants (DI-2): for one case the persons holding DA, IO, PO and each witness are mutually distinct, and the DA must not be the complainant or a witness; a charged respondent can never be IO/PO/DA on their own case.
- **Confidentiality.** TIER-3 masking (P02): confidential-source/whistle-blower identity (`is_confidential_source`), vigilance scoring, PI reports and sealed-cover contents are hard-hidden except VO/DA per action gates. IO/PO cannot view vigilance scoring or sealed-cover. Relied-upon material must nonetheless be disclosed to the charged officer before a finding rests on it (DI-9).
- **Seed templates.** `tpl-ccs` (standard CCS template: subsistence floor/ceiling [25,75], `valid_service_modes_json` = {BY_HAND, REGISTERED_POST, AFFIXTURE}, EMAIL non-statutory, appeal limitation 45 days, mandatory consultation UPSC for MAJOR on Group-A), `tpl-posh` (HARASSMENT → ICC route, external member mandatory), and a mis-configured/ambiguous template `tpl-bad` for DI-17 negatives.
- **Seed actors/cases.** Group-A officer `emp-3001` (major track), Group-C officer `emp-3002` (minor track), retiree `emp-3009`, deceased-during-proceeding `emp-3010`, POSH respondent `emp-3004`, joint respondents `emp-3005/emp-3006`. DA `emp-9001` (competent for major), DA `emp-9002` (competent minor only), appellate `emp-9500`.
- **Assertion oracle.** Negatives assert the exact `error.code` **and** HTTP status. Positives assert resulting entity `status`/`stage`, side effects (SR event id, downstream effect rows, SLA recompute), and audit-chain continuity.
