# Cross-FR Integration Review

Detect conflicts between FRs that individual FR review cannot catch. Two FRs that each pass Stage 8 can still produce runtime failures when they interact. This review requires the complete codebase — run it only after all FRs are merged to the integration branch.

## Why Individual Review Is Not Enough

Individual FR review checks each FR against its own LLD. It cannot check:
- Whether FR-012 and FR-018 both write to `orders` with incompatible transaction boundaries
- Whether FR-007 and FR-023 trigger state transitions that create impossible states
- Whether FR-005 and FR-014 both call the same external service in ways that combine to exceed rate limits
- Whether FR-009 and FR-031 each invented their own response shape despite the API contract

This review checks all of these.

## Trigger Condition

Run when `manifest.json` shows all FRs in `merged` status:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
m = json.load(open('manifest.json'))
statuses = [f['status'] for f in m['features'].values()]
all_merged = all(s in ['merged', 'escalated'] for s in statuses)
print('READY' if all_merged else 'NOT READY — pending FRs:', [f for f,v in m['features'].items() if v['status'] not in ['merged','escalated']])
"
```

## Process

### Phase 0: Inventory

Build a map of what each FR touches:

```bash
# Extract all tables touched per FR from LLDs
for lld in docs/lld/FR-*.md; do
  fr=$(basename "$lld" .md)
  tables=$(rg "INSERT INTO|UPDATE|DELETE FROM|FROM " "$lld" | grep -oP '\b[a-z_]+\b' | sort -u | tr '\n' ',')
  echo "$fr: $tables"
done

# Extract state transitions per FR
rg "state_machine|status.*→|transition" docs/lld/FR-*.md -l

# Extract external service calls per FR
rg "integration-map|External Service" docs/lld/FR-*.md -l
```

Produce an inventory matrix:

```
Cross-FR Inventory
==================
Table → FRs that write to it:
  orders:       FR-002 (create), FR-007 (submit), FR-015 (cancel), FR-018 (fulfil)
  order_items:  FR-002 (create), FR-018 (update)
  inventory:    FR-018 (decrement), FR-021 (restock)

State Machine → FRs that trigger transitions:
  order_status: FR-007 (draft→submitted), FR-015 (submitted→cancelled), FR-018 (approved→fulfilled)

External Service → FRs that call it:
  Stripe:       FR-010 (charge), FR-016 (refund)
  Resend:       FR-007 (submission confirmation), FR-018 (fulfilment notification)
```

### Phase 1: Shared Table Conflicts

For every table written by more than one FR, check the generated code:

#### 1a. Transaction Boundary Compatibility

Find the database operations in each FR's generated code:

```bash
# Find transaction blocks
rg "BEGIN|START TRANSACTION|db\.transaction|pool\.query.*BEGIN" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -l

# Find concurrent write patterns
rg "INSERT INTO orders|UPDATE orders" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | head -30
```

Check for:
- Two FRs wrapping the same rows in transactions simultaneously (potential deadlock if lock order differs)
- FR-A locks `orders` then `order_items`; FR-B locks `order_items` then `orders` — deadlock risk
- Missing `SELECT FOR UPDATE` where concurrent reads before writes exist

```bash
# Check lock order consistency for tables locked by multiple FRs
rg "SELECT.*FOR UPDATE|FOR SHARE" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n
```

**Finding format:**
```
CONFLICT: FR-007 and FR-018 both update orders.status without SELECT FOR UPDATE
  FR-007: src/app/api/orders/[id]/submit/route.ts:45
  FR-018: src/app/api/orders/[id]/fulfil/route.ts:62
  Risk: Race condition — concurrent submit+fulfil can both succeed, leaving order in undefined state
  Fix: Both operations must use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE or serializable transaction isolation
```

#### 1b. Soft-Delete Consistency

```bash
# Check that all FRs touching the same table handle soft-deletes consistently
rg "deleted_at" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | grep -v "test"

# Find FRs that query without deleted_at IS NULL filter
for table in $(rg "CREATE TABLE" docs/data-model/schema.sql | grep -oP '(?<=TABLE )\w+'); do
  echo "=== $table ==="
  rg "FROM $table" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | grep -v "deleted_at"
done
```

Any query on a soft-deletable table without `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` is a conflict.

#### 1c. Column Update Conflicts

```bash
# Check that no two FRs update the same column with conflicting logic
rg "SET .* =" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | sort
```

If FR-A sets `orders.total = sum_of_items` and FR-B sets `orders.total = fixed_price`, they conflict.

### Phase 2: State Machine Compatibility

For every entity with a status enum, check that all FRs touching it are compatible:

```bash
# Load state machine definitions
cat docs/contracts/state-machines.md

# Find all status updates in generated code
rg "status.*=.*['\"]|\.status\s*=\s*['\"]" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n
```

#### 2a. Impossible State Combinations

Given the valid transitions from `docs/contracts/state-machines.md`:

```bash
# Check that every status assignment is to a valid target state
# For each FR, extract the (from_state, to_state) pairs and verify against state machine
```

Detect: two FRs that can race and both attempt transitions from the same state — resulting in an entity reaching an invalid state.

**Example finding:**
```
CONFLICT: FR-007 and FR-015 can both execute when order is in 'submitted' state
  FR-007 transitions: submitted → approved
  FR-015 transitions: submitted → cancelled
  These are both valid individually, but if executed simultaneously:
  - No SELECT FOR UPDATE in either FR
  - Second FR will silently succeed on a stale read
  Fix: Both FRs must use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on the orders row before checking status
```

#### 2b. Side Effect Conflicts

```bash
# Find notification triggers per FR
rg "sendEmail|sendNotification|createNotification" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n
```

Check: do two FRs both send the same notification for the same event (duplicate email)?

### Phase 3: External Service Conflicts

For every external service called by more than one FR:

#### 3a. Rate Limit Exposure

```bash
# Find all calls to each external service
for service in Stripe Resend OpenAI Supabase; do
  echo "=== $service ==="
  rg "$service\|resend\|stripe\|openai" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | grep -v test | grep -v mock
done
```

Calculate worst-case call rate: if FR-010 and FR-016 both call Stripe under the same conditions, do the combined calls exceed Stripe's rate limit?

#### 3b. Error Handling Consistency

```bash
# Compare error handling across FRs calling the same service
rg "catch.*External\|ExternalServiceError\|TimeoutError" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n
```

Conflict: FR-A retries on timeout, FR-B fails immediately on timeout — inconsistent behaviour for the same service.

#### 3c. Shared Credentials

```bash
# Check that FRs don't overwrite each other's external service state
rg "apiClient\.\|sdkInstance\." src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | head -20
```

### Phase 4: API Contract Coherence

> **Note (2026-06-07):** Phase 4 is the safety net for drift that Gate C's symmetric closure check should have caught at Stage 5. If Phase 4 finds an error code missing from the taxonomy, or a planned audit-INSERT that violates a CHECK constraint, this is a `quality-gate-checker` Gate C miss — flag it in the Stage 9 report so Gate C remediation gets stronger next run. The drift checks below remain necessary as the final guard but should fire as the *exception*, not the rule.

Check that all generated code matches the API contract:

```bash
# Extract all defined routes from generated code
rg "router\.(get|post|put|patch|delete)|app\.(get|post|put|patch|delete)" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | grep -oP '(get|post|put|patch|delete).*["\x27]/[^"\x27]+["\x27]' | sort

# Compare against api-contract.yaml
cat docs/contracts/api-contract.yaml | grep "^  /" | sort
```

#### 4a. Response Shape Drift

```bash
# Check that response objects match the API contract schema
# For each endpoint in api-contract.yaml, find the corresponding route handler and check the return shape
rg "return.*NextResponse\|return.*response\|res\.json\|return.*jsonify" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n
```

Find any FR that returns a field not in the contract, or omits a required field.

#### 4b. Error Code Drift

```bash
# Check that all error codes used are in the taxonomy
rg "code:.*['\"]|'code'.*:" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | grep -oP "['\"][A-Z_]+['\"]" | sort -u

# Compare against error-taxonomy.md
rg "^\| \`" docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.md | grep -oP '`[A-Z_]+`' | sort -u
```

Any error code in the code not in the taxonomy is a drift violation.

#### 4c. Auth Pattern Consistency

```bash
# Check that all protected routes use the same auth middleware
rg "requireAuth\|withAuth\|authenticate\|@require_auth" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n

# Find routes that skip auth without being in the public list
rg "router\.(get|post)" src/ --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.py' -n | grep -v "requireAuth\|withAuth\|authenticate"
```

Compare against `public_endpoints` in `docs/contracts/auth-matrix.json`.

### Phase 5: Produce the Integration Report

Write to `docs/reviews/cross-fr-integration-report.md`:

```markdown
# Cross-FR Integration Review
*Date: [date] | FRs reviewed: N | Branch: [integration branch]*

## Executive Summary
[overall verdict, number of conflicts found, severity breakdown]

## Inventory Matrix
[Table → FRs, State Machine → FRs, External Service → FRs]

## Conflicts Found

### CRITICAL — Must fix before merge to main
[Each conflict with: description, affected FRs, affected files:lines, specific fix required]

### HIGH — Should fix before release
[...]

### MEDIUM — Technical debt, fix in next sprint
[...]

## Clean Checks
[What was checked and found clean — for audit trail]

## Verdict
[PASS | CONDITIONAL | BLOCKED]
Blocking items: [list if BLOCKED]
```

### Phase 6: Update Manifest

```json
{
  "cross_fr_review": {
    "status": "complete",
    "triggered_at": "<iso8601>",
    "verdict": "PASS|CONDITIONAL|BLOCKED",
    "conflicts_critical": 0,
    "conflicts_high": 1,
    "report": "docs/reviews/cross-fr-integration-report.md",
    "signed_off": false
  }
}
```

### Phase 7: Present to Human

After generating the report:
- State the verdict clearly
- List every CRITICAL conflict with its fix
- Ask the human to review the report and sign off in `manifest.json`
- Do not block on sign-off — surface the findings and let the human decide

## Verdict Rules

- **PASS** — Zero CRITICAL, zero HIGH conflicts
- **CONDITIONAL** — Zero CRITICAL, 1+ HIGH conflicts (document them, may proceed with known debt)
- **BLOCKED** — Any CRITICAL conflict — must be resolved before merging to main
