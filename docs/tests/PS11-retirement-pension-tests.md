# PS11 — Retirement and Pension Management — Acceptance & E2E Test Suite

## 1. Header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | PS11 — Retirement and Pension Management (alias `PS-M11`; supersedes `M11-PEN`) |
| Program | PrimeSoft HRMS — PrimeSoft platform extension (net-new statutory pension engine) |
| Spec version under test | BRD v3.0 (`docs/brd/v3/PS11-retirement-and-pension.md`) |
| API contract | `docs/contracts/openapi/PS11.yaml` (OpenAPI 3.1, `/api/v1`) |
| Error taxonomy | `docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.yaml` — `ERR-PS11-*` under the platform 8-code table |
| State machines | `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml` (PS11) + BRD §10.1–10.10 |
| Authorization | `docs/contracts/auth-matrix.yaml` (PS11 roles/actions) + RBAC v1.7 (P02) |
| Scope | FR-PS11-01 … FR-PS11-24 + SR-ledger posting contract (§8.7) + calc appendices §16 |
| Test levels | Acceptance (black-box API), Financial-Integrity (exact-value), State-Transition, Authorization, Data-Integrity, API-Contract, and one full E2E flow |

### 1.1 Traceability convention

Every case cites **Traces-to** = FR id + AC/BR/edge/state/appendix anchor. Negatives assert the **exact `ERR-PS11-*` code (carried in `error.code` or `details.reason`) + HTTP wire status**. Financial cases assert **exact monetary values** in `NUMERIC(15,2)` rupee strings.

### 1.2 Test-environment & data assumptions

| Concern | Assumption |
|---|---|
| Multi-tenancy | Single enterprise tenant `T1`; departments as entities `E-REV` (Revenue) and `E-HEALTH` (Health). Every row carries `tenant_id`/`entity_id`; unscoped queries are rejected (P02 §0.1), never defaulted to "all". |
| Personas / roles | `PO` = Pension Officer (maker, `pension_officer`, MFA), `SA` = Pension Sanctioning Authority (checker, `pension_sanctioning_authority`, MFA), `PDA` = Pension Disbursing Authority (`pension_disbursing_authority`), `SRC` = SR Custodian (PS12, `sr_custodian`), `PAYO` = Payroll Officer (PS10, `payroll_officer`), `MED` = Medical Board (`medical_board`), `SYS` = Org Admin/SysAdmin (rule tables), `AUD` = Auditor (org-admin read + P05 query), `EMP` = Employee/Pensioner (self-service). |
| Money precision | All benefit amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)`; rates/factors `NUMERIC(9,4)`; service in integer Y/M/D. No floating point. Rounding per E36. |
| Platform conventions | Bearer JWT (P02); `Idempotency-Key` required on every transaction-creating POST (24h replay → original result); cursor pagination (`?limit=` default 25/max 100 + `cursor=`); `X-Correlation-Id` echoed + audited; canonical `{error:{code,message,field,details}}` envelope; P05 DB-trigger captures every mutation immutably. |
| Rule tables (effective 30-Jun-2026) | E35 min pension `₹9,000.00`, min-service threshold `10 years`; commuted fraction max `0.40`; gratuity base ceiling `₹20,00,000.00`, `+25%` step per 50% DA threshold crossed; commutation factor age-next-birthday `61 = 8.1940`; family-pension normal `0.3000` / enhanced `0.5000`; gratuity exemption cap `₹20,00,000.00`; leave-encashment cap `300 days`. |
| Standard financial fixture — `EMP-SUP-01` (superannuation, OPS) | last basic `₹1,00,000.00`; DA 50% ⇒ emoluments (basic+DA) `₹1,50,000.00`; net qualifying service `33y 0m` ⇒ `66` reckonable half-years (capped); avg-12-month pay `₹1,20,000.00`. |
