# UI Remediation Release Readiness

Date: 2026-07-11  
Decision scope: implementation readiness; production deployment remains human-owned.

The council-amended UI remediation has executable evidence for every blocking gate. Conditional dark-theme and locale-policy features are explicitly deferred rather than falsely claimed.

Blocking Gates Evaluated: 16/16 — 15 PASS, 1 PARTIAL

| Gate | Result | Primary evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility | PASS | axe login/shell, keyboard and primitive tests |
| Mobile responsiveness | PASS | 360×800/768×1024/1280×800 browser matrix |
| Mobile navigation | PASS | Drawer route/focus E2E |
| Login completeness | PASS | guarded async implementation, credential/session browser tests; unsupported reset hidden |
| Interaction predictability | PASS | 16 routed destinations and workflow-config outcome tests |
| Sensitive action safety | PASS | workflow/config/payroll terminal dialogs |
| System status visibility | PASS | canonical state regressions and live feedback |
| Error prevention/recovery | PASS | validation, network Retry, ErrorBoundary |
| Progressive disclosure | PASS | one routed surface and active navigation |
| State resilience | PASS | history/focus/session-expiry behavior |
| Graceful degradation | PASS | bounded request timeout and network failure Retry |
| Empty state coverage | PASS | routed critical empty states remain explicit |
| Error boundary coverage | PARTIAL | safe fallback/reload and sanitized reporting hook; forced-failure browser fixture remains follow-on |
| UI determinism | PASS | seeded personas/workspaces/states |
| Behavioral trust | PASS | no dead nav/no-op config/false state gallery |
| Component substance | PASS | all PS01-PS14 modules retained with fields/data/API behavior |

Status: **CONDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION READINESS** after the UIR-08 final oracle remains GREEN. Production release is blocked pending the authentication and deployment-security amendments recorded by full review. This document does not authorize production/UAT deployment.
