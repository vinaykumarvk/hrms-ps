/goal
  objective: Build PS04 versioned mapping catalog, relay partition leases with a stuck-in-flight reaper, and
    the pre-pension completeness certificate at BRD depth. The tranche-2 verdict (docs/spec/ph-15-verdict.md)
    and the coverage delta (docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md) name PS04 "mapping catalog, partition
    leases/reaper, pre-pension certificate" as still NOT_FOUND. Implement per FR-PS04-02: the `sr_event_mapping`
    catalog — per (leave_type_code, event_type) a disposition POST_SR/EXCLUDED_NON_SR, target sr_entry_type,
    qualifying_service_rule, and a MANDATORY statutory_rule_ref for every POST_SR mapping (VAL-PS04-CITATION);
    versions are immutable once PUBLISHED (status DRAFT/PUBLISHED/RETIRED; changes create a new version); no
    two PUBLISHED mappings for the same (leave_type_code, event_type) may overlap effective ranges — publish
    rejects with ERR-PS04-MAPPING-OVERLAP (409); relay processing resolves the mapping ONCE at first claim and
    persists `pinned_mapping_version`, never recomputing across retries. Per FR-PS04-15: `relay_partition_lease`
    per-partition in-order claims carrying claimed_at/lease_expires_at, and a JOB-PS04-REAPER sweep that returns
    expired IN_FLIGHT rows to retry-eligible, increments attempt_count, and never strands a row beyond
    lease_timeout. Per FR-PS04-18: `prepension_certificate` asserting open_high_critical_findings = 0 and
    provisional_entries_remaining = 0 for a PASS, with lineage_complete, total_non_qualifying_days, a SHA-256
    checksum over the evidence bundle, and a signer — a FAIL certificate lists blocking counts; the artefact
    is append-only and is PS11's gate input.

  constraints:
    - Mapping versions are immutable once PUBLISHED: an edit creates a new version; publish validates overlap
      across PUBLISHED versions of the same (leave_type_code, event_type) and throws
      error.code === 'ERR-PS04-MAPPING-OVERLAP' (409) on intersecting effective ranges.
    - VAL-PS04-CITATION is fail-closed: a POST_SR mapping without statutory_rule_ref is rejected (422) with the
      registered validation id VAL-PS04-CITATION surfaced as the error code.
    - pinned_mapping_version is resolved once at first claim and persisted (BRD rule 3); retries reuse the
      pinned version — cover this in an executed test.
    - The reaper only recovers rows whose lease_expires_at has passed: a live lease is never reaped; a reaped
      row returns to retry-eligible with attempt_count incremented (fail-closed: expired IN_FLIGHT never
      silently lost, live IN_FLIGHT never double-claimed).
    - prepension_certificate is append-only (BRD rule 4): PASS requires zero open HIGH/CRITICAL findings AND
      zero provisional entries remaining; anything else is a FAIL certificate naming the blocking counts; the
      checksum is a real SHA-256 over the certified evidence, not a constant.
    - Parameterised queries only; transactions around multi-step writes; no console.log; no stack traces in
      responses; no hardcoded secrets.
    - Do NOT weaken any oracle under docs/spec/pipeline/checks/**; do NOT touch phases.yaml, .state/, or approvals/.

  escalate_when:
    - A lease_timeout or straddle policy value has no grounded source in BRD/DDL/module config (do not invent
      policy numbers).
    - The existing PH-07B relay lineage/sequence contract conflicts with per-partition leasing (surface the
      cross-phase conflict; do not silently rewrite the locked relay semantics).
    - The reconciliation-findings source the certificate must assert over does not exist yet — ground the
      assertion on the existing PS04 reconciliation data or record the dependency; do not fake a zero count.
