# PS08 — Performance Appraisal Management — Acceptance & E2E Test Suite

## 1. Header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | PS08 — Performance Appraisal Management (alias `PS-M08`; EXTEND of PrimeSoft M09) |
| BRD | `/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/brd/v3/PS08-performance-appraisal-management.md` (v3.0) |
| API contract | `/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/contracts/openapi/PS08.yaml` (OpenAPI 3.1, base `/api/v1`) |
| Error taxonomy | `/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.yaml` (ERR-PS08-* + 8-code platform table) |
| State machines | `/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml` (§PS08 appraisal_form / goal / representation / pip) |
| Auth matrix | `/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/contracts/auth-matrix.yaml` (§PS08 roles, capability flags, action codes) |
| Scope | FR-PS08-01 … FR-PS08-22 (statutory APAR core + Phase-2 flagged differentiators) |
| Suite version | 1.0 |

### 1.1 Traceability model
Every TC carries **Traces-to** (FR + AC/BR/Edge). Negative TCs assert the exact **error `code`** (carried in `error.code`) **and** the HTTP status of the 8-code platform table. Section 3 maps every FR → TC (0 gaps). Section 4 counts by type/priority.

### 1.2 Platform HTTP status table (assert against these only)
`VALIDATION_FAILED=422` · `UNAUTHENTICATED=401` · `FORBIDDEN=403` · `NOT_FOUND=404` · `CONFLICT=409` · `PRECONDITION_FAILED=412` · `RATE_LIMITED=429` · `INTERNAL=500`. `403`/`404` never leak existence of out-of-scope records (P02). Correlation id is in the `X-Correlation-Id` response header, never a body field.

### 1.3 ERR-PS08-* → HTTP quick map
| Code | HTTP | Code | HTTP |
|---|---|---|---|

### 1.4 Test-environment & data assumptions
- **Multi-tenant:** all requests carry a Bearer JWT with resolved roles + `tenant_id`/`entity_id` scope. Tenant `T1` is the system under test; tenant `T2` exists to prove cross-tenant isolation. Every business row carries `tenant_id`; an unscoped query is **rejected, not defaulted to all**.
- **Personas / roles** (auth-matrix §PS08):
  - `EMP-APPRAISEE` — Employee (appraisee, "Me" workspace).
  - `RO1`, `RO2` — Reporting Officers (Manager L1 + flag `ps08_appraiser_roles`; resolved by P01 reporting-chain position). RO1 supervises Apr–Oct; RO2 Nov–Mar.
  - `RVO` — Reviewing Officer (skip-level + `ps08_appraiser_roles`).
  - `AA` — Accepting Authority (role `ps08_accepting_authority`; MFA-enforced).
  - `COMP-AUTH` — Competent Authority (role `ps08_competent_authority`; senior to AA, not in chain) + flag `ps08_condonation`.
  - `CALIB-MBR` — Calibration Committee Member (flag `ps08.calibration-member`).
  - `HR-CELL` — HR Admin + Performance Admin (cycle/custody/disclosure admin).
  - `CUSTODIAN` — role `ps08_apar_custodian`.
  - `DUAL-CTRL` — second custodian/HR with flag `ps08_dual_control`.
  - `HEIR` — Legal heir / nominee (time-bound individual entitlement).
  - `AUDITOR` — Org-Admin read + read-only entitlement.
  - `SYS-ADMIN` — Org Admin / Platform Super Admin (config only, no self-adjudication).
- **APAR confidentiality:** APAR content is CONFIDENTIAL; served through the P02 PII Protection Ceiling + **field-mask-on-serialization** (masked fields **absent**, not greyed, with a "why hidden" reason). Multi-role callers get the **lowest-privilege** mask (intersection).
- **Signature (DSC/eSign):** MFA step-up (P02) authenticates the session; the **digital signature (E23)** binds the record — distinct controls. Certification/ack/ratify/expunge/No-Report/seal-release/dispose/downgrade all require a VALID signature.
- **Fixtures:** cycle `APAR-2025-26` (fiscal `2025-2026`), template `APAR-OFFR-V2` (PUBLISHED, `requires_dsc=true`, `weightage_policy={performance_sum:100, goal_split_pct:70, competency_split_pct:30, development_in_sum:false}`), scale `APAR-10PT` (min 1.00, max 10.00, `benchmark_grade=6.00`, `adverse_threshold=4.00`, `decimal_places=2`), `min_supervision_months=3.0`, `representation_window_days=30`, `deemed_disclosure_days=15`. Idempotency-Key supplied on all unsafe POSTs; 24h replay window.
- **PS12 write-port:** final grade posts via internal façade `POST /ps08/forms/{formId}/post-to-sr` → canonical `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` with `event_type=APAR_FINAL_GRADE`, `event_category=APPRAISAL`, `source_module=PS08`, `source_reference_id=form_id`, dedup tuple `(source_module, source_reference_id, source_event_version)`.
