# BRD Coverage Review — PS03 Attendance and Leave Management

Date: 2026-07-02
BRD under review: `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md`
Verdict: **FAIL — leave/attendance proof slice implemented, full BRD not yet implemented**

## Scope

The PS03 BRD defines 23 functional requirements from `FR-01` through `FR-23` (`docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1075`, `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1333`). It covers a full time-and-absence product: shifts, rosters, holidays, biometric/mobile punches, daily attendance processing, regularisation, overtime, WFH/OD/tour, comp-off, leave configuration, accruals, leave approval, cancellation, backdating/conflicts, year close, encashment, payroll feed, self-service, delegation, anomaly review, biometric/geo consent, sanction-based leave counters, and advanced absence features.

## Evidence Base

Executable implementation found:

- Single backend service file: `apps/api/src/modules/ps03/leaveService.ts`.
- Single route file: `apps/api/src/routes/ps03.routes.ts`.
- Single PS03 web module: `apps/web/src/modules/ps03/LeaveWorkspace.tsx`.
- Service implements in-memory leave application submission, P01 reporting-chain workflow start, balance reservation, approval, rejection, delegation, cancellation, accrual, attendance capture, attendance regularisation, overtime signal, and payroll signal listing (`apps/api/src/modules/ps03/leaveService.ts:83`, `apps/api/src/modules/ps03/leaveService.ts:503`).
- Routes expose leave applications, leave decision, leave balance, leave-SR outbox, leave accruals, attendance capture, attendance regularisation, overtime, and payroll signals (`apps/api/src/routes/ps03.routes.ts:17`, `apps/api/src/routes/ps03.routes.ts:194`).
- Tests cover leave submit/approve/delegate/SR handoff, API leave submit/approve, accrual, cancellation, attendance regularisation, overtime, and payroll signals (`apps/api/test/ph06-ps03-leave.test.cjs:32`, `apps/api/test/ph07-ps03-attendance-payroll.test.cjs:32`, `apps/api/test/ph07-ps03-attendance-payroll.test.cjs:77`).
- UI renders a proof card for leave approval evidence, not a full attendance/leave workspace (`apps/web/src/modules/ps03/LeaveWorkspace.tsx:9`, `apps/web/src/modules/ps03/LeaveWorkspace.tsx:49`).

Specification/design coverage found:

- OpenAPI covers the full PS03 contract and declares the current implemented minimum route set separately from the broader endpoint surface (`docs/contracts/openapi/PS03.yaml:33`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS03.yaml:45`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS03.yaml:56`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS03.yaml:104`).
- SQL data model states PS03 is the time-and-absence system of record and covers the full schema surface (`docs/data-model/03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql:5`, `docs/data-model/03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql:10`).
- SQL defines broad schema support for shifts, rosters, holidays, devices, DPDP consent, punches, leave types, accrual policies, leave ledger, leave applications, attendance daily, regularisation, overtime, exceptions, comp-off, payroll feed, adjustments, and encashment (`docs/data-model/03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql:196`, `docs/data-model/03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql:943`).

## User-Facing Coverage

The BRD requires Me/My Team/Admin workspaces for leave applications, balances, attendance, punches, rosters, calendars, approvals, regularisation, overtime, comp-off, year close, encashment, payroll feed, delegations, anomalies, consents, entitlements, and advanced absence actions (`docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1338`, `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1362`). Current UI is a static proof card with leave approval facts and evidence markers (`apps/web/src/modules/ps03/LeaveWorkspace.tsx:23`, `apps/web/src/modules/ps03/LeaveWorkspace.tsx:48`).

## Test Coverage Assessment

Existing tests are useful but narrow:

- Leave workflow/PS04 SR handoff/API path is tested in `apps/api/test/ph06-ps03-leave.test.cjs:32` and `apps/api/test/ph06-ps03-leave.test.cjs:72`.
- Accrual/cancellation/payroll signal path is tested in `apps/api/test/ph07-ps03-attendance-payroll.test.cjs:32`.
- Attendance regularisation/overtime/API payroll signals are tested in `apps/api/test/ph07-ps03-attendance-payroll.test.cjs:57` and `apps/api/test/ph07-ps03-attendance-payroll.test.cjs:77`.
- No automated tests were found for shifts, rosters, holiday calendars, punch ingestion devices/geo/consent, daily attendance processing, WFH/OD/tour, comp-off redemption, leave config, policy accrual, year close, encashment, locked payroll feed, self-service UI, delegation records, anomaly review, DPDP consent, entitlement counters, forecast, mass leave, blackout, or return-to-work.

Validation baseline captured during this review:

- `npm test` passed: 125/125 API tests.
- `npm run web:test` passed: 32/32 web tests.
- These green checks validate the implemented proof slices; they do not close the PS03 BRD gaps listed here.

## Critical Gaps

| Gap ID | Severity | Gap | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PS03-COV-001 | Critical | OpenAPI/schema define a complete attendance and leave product, but runtime implements only a reduced in-memory proof slice. | Broad OpenAPI tags `docs/contracts/openapi/PS03.yaml:56`-`104`; runtime routes `apps/api/src/routes/ps03.routes.ts:17`-`194`; service `apps/api/src/modules/ps03/leaveService.ts:83`-`503` |
| PS03-COV-002 | Critical | Attendance core is incomplete: no shifts/rosters/holidays/punch ingestion/daily rollup, so leave/payroll behavior is not grounded in real attendance facts. | BRD FR-01..FR-04 `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1075`-`1145`; missing from route file `apps/api/src/routes/ps03.routes.ts:17`-`194` |
| PS03-COV-003 | High | Public-sector leave policy features are absent: comp-off, leave configuration, policy accrual, year close, encashment, entitlement counters, forecast/mass leave/blackout/return-to-work. | BRD FR-09..FR-11 and FR-15..FR-16 and FR-22..FR-23 `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1193`-`1228`, `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1267`-`1279`, `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1322`-`1333` |
| PS03-COV-004 | High | Privacy/fraud controls for biometric/geo attendance are absent. | BRD FR-20/FR-21 `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1306`, `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1314`; schema exists `docs/data-model/03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql:331`, `docs/data-model/03-PS03-attendance-leave.sql:187` |
| PS03-COV-005 | High | UI is not a usable PS03 workspace. | BRD UI `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md:1338`; UI file `apps/web/src/modules/ps03/LeaveWorkspace.tsx:9`-`49` |

## Scorecard

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| BRD line-item implementation | 8 / 23 FRs materially touched | FR-03, 05, 06, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20 are partial; most policy/admin/privacy surfaces are gaps |
| API contract conformance | Low to medium | Implemented route surface is much smaller than OpenAPI |
| Data model coverage | High as design artefact | SQL covers most entities; runtime does not use the schema |
| Backend behavior | Medium for proof slice | Leave approval and attendance/payroll signal slices work |
| Frontend behavior | Low | Static proof card only |
| Automated tests | Medium for proof slice, low for full BRD | Tests cover core proof slices only |

Overall status: **Not release-complete for PS03.** The current implementation is a valuable vertical slice, not the full attendance and leave module.

## Recommended Remediation Path

1. Keep the existing leave approval/PS04 payroll-signal tests as regression baseline.
2. Build attendance foundations next: shifts, rosters, holidays, punch ingestion, daily processing.
3. Expand leave policy runtime: leave types, policies, accrual engine, ledger read/adjustment, comp-off.
4. Add compliance controls: biometric/geo consent, anomaly review, delegation records.
5. Add payroll feed locking/ack/adjustments before encashment/year close.
6. Replace the proof-card UI with Me/My Team/Admin workflows and behavioral tests.
