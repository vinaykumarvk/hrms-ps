/goal
  objective: Build PS10 loans/perquisites/GL/bank-file depth and PS11 treasury-PDA/grievances/audit-objections
    at BRD depth. The tranche-2 verdict (docs/spec/ph-15-verdict.md) names PS10 "loans/advances lifecycle,
    perquisites valuation, GL posting, bank-file positive-pay depth" and PS11 "treasury/PDA interfaces,
    pensioner grievances" as still open. Implement per FR-PS10-08: `loans_advances` instalment recovery over
    `loan_repayments` — each run recovers the scheduled instalment, the final instalment closes the loan with
    the closure invariant (sum of recovered principal = sanctioned principal; ledger never negative),
    foreclosure computes outstanding + accrued interest in one entry, and insufficient net throws
    ERR-PS10-RECOVERY-NET (409) with the shortfall rolled into `deduction_carryforwards`. Per FR-PS10-21: an
    is_concessional loan auto-produces an ACTIVE `perquisites` row valued per Rule 3 (reducing balance x
    (reference rate - charged rate)) feeding the tax pipeline; a missing reference rate throws
    ERR-PS10-PERQ-REFRATE (422). Per FR-PS10-19: `gl_journals` per run with the balance invariant
    total_debit = total_credit (an unbalanced journal is blocked, never exported) and posting lifecycle
    tracked through POSTED/ACKNOWLEDGED. Per FR-PS10-14: on ambiguous/timeout ack the bank batch moves to
    SUSPECTED_PROCESSED and resend is forbidden until a positive-pay/treasury-debit confirmation records
    non-debit; a confirmed resend issues a NEW bank_batch_ref; failed lines park in `disbursement_holds`.
    Per FR-PS11-21: the `pen_disbursing_authorities` registry with pda_disbursement_model
    (M11_COMPUTES_FULL | PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF); a PDA cannot go ACTIVE until sandbox_certified=true. Per
    FR-PS11-16: `pen_grievances` intake with category/priority, SLA due dates, escalation on breach, and
    closure requiring resolution text (VAL-COMMENT). Per FR-PS11-23: `pen_audit_objections` with source,
    calc_trace_ref linkage, SLA response routing, and outcome-driven closure
    (ACCEPTED_CORRECTED/DROPPED/RECOVERY_RAISED) through RAISED -> UNDER_RESPONSE -> RESPONDED -> CLOSED.

  constraints:
    - All money is integer paise (PH-09A float ban stands). The loan ledger never goes negative: a recovery
      exceeding the outstanding balance is rejected — the BRD registers no specific over-recovery code
      (FR-PS10-08 names only "ledger never negative"), so use the closest registered platform code CONFLICT
      (409) and say so in a code comment (never mint). Insufficient net uses the registered
      error.code === 'ERR-PS10-RECOVERY-NET' with a deduction_carryforwards row.
    - Closure invariant is asserted, not assumed: on final instalment the sum of recovered principal equals
      the sanctioned principal and the loan closes; foreclosure settles outstanding + accrued interest in a
      single entry and stops future recovery (and stops the concessional perquisite going forward).
    - gl_journals must balance: total_debit != total_credit is rejected before export — the BRD registers no
      specific imbalance code (FR-PS10-19 says "GL imbalance -> block"), so use the registered platform
      VALIDATION_FAILED (422) and say so in a code comment; posting status advances EXPORTED -> POSTED ->
      ACKNOWLEDGED only, never skipping.
    - Positive-pay is fail-closed: a SUSPECTED_PROCESSED batch rejects any resend until a non-debit
      confirmation by a principal distinct from the transmitter; the resend carries a NEW bank_batch_ref
      (never reuse); build on the existing PH-09 disbursement tie-out, do not fork it.
    - PDA activation is gated: status ACTIVE requires sandbox_certified=true — the BRD registers no specific
      code (FR-PS11-21 AC2), so use the registered platform PRECONDITION_FAILED (412) and say so in a code
      comment. Grievance closure without resolution text throws the registered validation id VAL-COMMENT.
    - Parameterised queries only; transactions around multi-step writes; no console.log; no stack traces in
      responses; no hardcoded secrets.
    - Do NOT weaken any oracle under docs/spec/pipeline/checks/**; do NOT touch phases.yaml, .state/, or approvals/.

  escalate_when:
    - An interest method, reference rate, or SLA matrix value has no grounded source in BRD/DDL/module config
      (do not invent policy numbers).
    - The PH-09 locked payroll/disbursement tie-out conflicts with the new recovery or hold flows (surface
      the cross-phase conflict; do not silently rewrite the locked engine).
    - The PH-15A tax pipeline lacks the perquisite_total intake needed for Rule-3 wiring — record the
      dependency; do not fork a second tax path.
