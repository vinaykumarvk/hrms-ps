# Promotion, Posting & Progression Monitoring — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS06, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Module code:** PS06 (alias PS-M06; supersedes the `M06-PPP` code from `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`; see `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §B)
**Program:** PrimeSoft HRMS — a public-sector configuration and extension of the **PrimeSoft HRMS** platform (Vision §1.1; not a greenfield build)
**Document version:** v3.0 (platform re-grounded; preserves all v2.0 content and rigor, re-anchored onto PrimeSoft platform services)
**Status:** Approved for build (parallel-agent ready) — incorporates all v2 Adversarial-Council improvements **and** the platform-grounding contract
**Grounding authority:** `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` (Master BRD v2.1 · Product Vision v2.6 · Platform Spec v1.6 · RBAC Design v1.7 · Foundation FS v1.6) and `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` (PS06 row §A; convention overrides §C; net-new register §D). Where this BRD and a platform artefact conflict on intent, **the platform artefact governs**.
**Relationship (reconciliation §A):** **NET-NEW (enterprise-specific)** — seniority lists, promotion cases, DPC, reservation roster, ACP/MACP, posting/progression are public-sector and have no PrimeSoft counterpart. PrimeSoft **PS08** (ex-M09 Performance) covers appraisal/APAR **only**, not seniority/promotion-case. PS06 authors the seniority/promotion-case statutory engine and **runs it on platform services**: approval/DPC flows on **P01**, audit on **P05**, migration on **P06**, jobs on **X.1**, notifications on **X.2/W.3**, RBAC enforcement on **P02**; it **consumes** PS08 appraisal and PS09 vigilance status by reference and **writes SR events to the PS12 SR ledger on the P05 substrate**.

> **Reading rule.** This v3 preserves every v2 capability, entity, field, rule, state and worked example, and re-grounds the technical substrate. Platform claims trace to a source as `(Platform §P01)`, `(Foundation §1)`, `(RBAC §6.6)`. Net-new statutory logic PS06 authors itself is marked **`GAP (enterprise-specific)`** but still runs on the named platform engine.

## Section 1 — Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Promotion, Posting & Progression Monitoring module (PS06) is the statutory and managerial engine that governs how a public-sector employee **moves upward** through the organisation: how seniority is established (including **multi-stream inter-se seniority** across direct recruits, promotees and LDCE qualifiers), how promotions are adjudicated by Departmental Promotion Committees (DPCs) and promotion panels, how the resulting orders and probation are managed, how financial up-gradation schemes (ACP/MACP) are sanctioned even in the absence of a functional promotion, how the employee is **posted** into the new role, and how the organisation **monitors** every employee's progression — due-for-promotion alerts, stagnation, increment timeliness, and career-path modelling.

Promotion in a enterprise context is a **quasi-judicial, rule-bound, reservation-aware, audit-heavy, and frequently litigated** process. A wrongly computed seniority position, an overlooked vigilance case, a mis-applied reservation roster point, an **own-merit reserved candidate wrongly counted against a reserved point**, reliance on an **uncommunicated adverse APAR**, or an **un-recorded court stay** can each trigger litigation, tribunal proceedings, and the unwinding of an entire promotion batch. PS06 therefore treats **a single versioned service-fact ledger, eligibility computation, panel adjudication, roster compliance with own-merit migration, court/tribunal linkage, correction-lineage cascades, and immutable service-register posting** as first-class, fully-audited capabilities. The audit immutability is delivered by the **P05 DB-trigger substrate** (not application code), and the service-register posting is an append to the **PS12 SR ledger** that itself runs on P05.

### 1.2 Business context & statutory drivers

- **Seniority** is the spine of public-sector careers. It determines eligibility zones, panel inclusion, and order-of-promotion. The same feeder grade is commonly fed by **multiple recruitment streams** (direct recruitment, promotion, LDCE/departmental examination, deputation-absorption); their **combined inter-se seniority** under rota/quota rotation of vacancies (the `N.R. Parmar` line of disputes) must be constructible and defensible. Tentative seniority lists are published, objections invited, disposed, and a final list notified — all with statutory cut-off dates.
- **Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC)** is the constitutional body that evaluates the eligible field and prepares Select Lists. A select panel has a **validity period** (typically one panel year); promotions from an expired panel are illegal. The DPC convening, member quorum, and select-list approval are modelled as a **P01 workflow** (committee-as-workflow; Platform §P01, §W.1), with member approvals captured as `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` branches and the appointing-authority sign-off as a `DYNAMIC_APPROVER` stage.
- **APAR usability** is statutory: per `Dev Dutt v. Union of India`, a below-benchmark/adverse APAR entry that was **not communicated** to the employee (with the representation disposed) **cannot be relied upon** by a DPC. A DPC that supersedes on an uncommunicated entry is voidable. APAR ratings and their communication/representation status are **consumed by reference from PS08** (ex-M09 Performance/APAR), never forked.
- **Reservation-in-promotion** (SC/ST/OBC/EWS/PwBD) is constitutionally gated: it requires the State to hold **quantifiable data of inadequacy of representation and effect on administrative efficiency** (`M. Nagaraj` / `Jarnail Singh`), correct **own-merit migration** (a reserved candidate selected on merit against an unreserved point must be adjusted against UR, not consume a reserved point), **consequential seniority vs catch-up** treatment, creamy-layer (OBC)/EWS **certificate currency as of the crucial date**, carry-forward, de-reservation limits, the 50% ceiling, and PwBD horizontal reservation.
- **Vigilance/disciplinary clearance** is a precondition; the **sealed cover** procedure must be supported where a charge is pending, with a mandatory periodic-review SLA and a partially-upheld minor-penalty branch. Vigilance/disciplinary status and case-conclusion events are **consumed by reference from PS09** (Disciplinary Cases & Punishment).
- **Financial up-gradation** schemes (Time-Bound Promotion / Assured Career Progression / Modified Assured Career Progression — ACP/MACP) guarantee pay progression on completion of qualifying service (e.g., 10/20/30 years), capped at **three financial up-gradations in a career**, with intervening regular promotions reducing the remaining entitlement and **refusal of promotion** stopping/forfeiting the MACP clock per policy.
- **Litigation awareness:** promotion orders are routinely issued "subject to the outcome of OA/SLP No. …", stayed by interim orders, and reopened on contempt. Any case/order/seniority list may be **sub judice**; the system must represent litigation references, interim stays, and **correction-lineage cascades** (a court-ordered retrospective promotion re-ranks an entire list and may require **stepping-up/pay-anomaly** flagging to PS10).
- Every promotion, posting, officiating arrangement, probation declaration, and financial up-gradation is a **statutory service event** that must post to the Digital Service Register (**PS12**) as an append-only entry on the P05 substrate.

### 1.3 Scope summary

In scope: **sanctioned-post/establishment-strength register and vacancy computation**; a single versioned **qualifying-service ledger with pinned exclusion rules**; multi-stream seniority management; eligibility computation (with APAR-usability and certificate-currency gates); DPC/panel workflow with **panel currency** on P01; select-list and promotion-order generation; **refusal-of-promotion consequence management**; probation lifecycle; ad-hoc/officiating/in-situ promotion; **LDCE/departmental-examination channel**; ACP/MACP financial up-gradation; reservation roster with **own-merit migration and consequential-seniority handling**; **legal-case linkage and sub-judice handling**; **correction-lineage and retrospective recompute cascades**; post-promotion posting; and progression monitoring (due-for-promotion, stagnation, increment monitoring as a *monitoring view* with PS10 as system-of-record, and an explicitly-advisory career-path & succession layer).

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): APAR capture & ratings (**PS08**, referenced), disciplinary/vigilance case management (**PS09**, referenced), lateral transfer/relieving/joining mechanics (**PS05**, reused for posting movement), payroll **fixation arithmetic and increment execution** (**PS10** — PS06 sanctions/monitors and hands off the pay event; PS10 is system-of-record for increments and stepping-up arithmetic), the SR ledger itself (**PS12**, PS06 writes events), competency master (**PS07**), enterprise analytics (**PS14**). Platform engines — workflow (P01), RBAC enforcement (P02), audit (P05), migration (P06), jobs (X.1), notifications (X.2), integrations (X.3), configured content (W.1–W.3) — are **consumed, never re-authored** (Foundation §9; Reconciliation §C).

> **FR numbering note.** The 20 functional requirements retain their stable `FR-PPP-NNN` identifiers (used pervasively in the traceability matrix §15 and the cross-FR dependency graph) to preserve v2 traceability intact. The owning **module is PS06**; module-unique platform ids (`VAL-PS06-*`, `JOB-PS06-*`, `MSG-PS06-*`, `ERR-PS06-*`) adopt the enterprise PS-code scheme per Reconciliation §B.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (consumed from the PrimeSoft platform)

These are **platform services consumed by id**, not module-local re-implementations (Foundation §9; Reconciliation §C/§D):

- **Maker-checker** on every statutory artefact (seniority list publication, select list approval, order issue, MACP sanction, de-reservation, correction-event approval) is a **configured P01 flow** (`workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`; Platform §P01, §W.1). **SoD (maker ≠ checker, no self-approval) is enforced by P01/P02**, not re-coded.
- **Immutable audit** via **P05** — every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE on a PS06 table fires a **DB trigger** writing one immutable row to `audit_log` (data mutations) / `security_audit_log` (auth/permission/admin events). 100% mutation capture, zero gaps; no application-bypass possible (Platform §P05).
- **Append-only SR posting** to the **PS12 SR ledger** (`service_register_events`, the net-new enterprise ledger running on the P05 substrate; Reconciliation §C/§D) on every promotion/posting/officiating/confirmation/financial/correction event. The **only** ledger write-path is the canonical **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal` for corrections); any module-local `…/post-to-sr` endpoint is an internal façade that **relays to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (no direct table INSERT, never `/api/v1/sr/events`). Dedup is the PS12 tuple **`(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id, source_event_version)`**; every qualifying-service-bearing event also carries a **`fact_key`** (mandatory; per the event type's `fact_correlation_rule`, PS12 FR-01) and explicit **`tenant_id`+`entity_id`**. The exact PS12-published `event_type` codes PS06 may emit are pinned in **§9.7.1**.
- **Document management** via **PS13** (ex-M11 Documents) for DPC minutes, orders, objection letters, roster registers, Nagaraj quantifiable-data records, court orders, exam results — versioned, access-controlled, encrypted (`VAL-PS13`/`VAL-M11-RETENTION` retention classes).
- **Notifications** via **X.2 + W.3** (channels `IN_APP` + `EMAIL` in parallel; statutory notices mandatory/non-suppressible per BRD §9.9). Templates referenced by `MSG-PS06-*` id; never inlined.
- **RBAC + five-dimension row-level scoping + field masking** via **P02** (a DPC member sees only candidates within authorised cadre/org scope; the APAR/disciplinary/category PII concentration in `eligibility_assessments` is masked on serialization per the PII Protection Ceiling). Enforcement is model-driven; the model is owned by RBAC v1.7.
- **Cursor pagination** (`?limit=` default 25, max 100, `next_cursor`) on all list endpoints; **i18n** (DD-MMM-YYYY, INR) per the Foundation UI-state standard (Foundation §1, §3).
- **`tenant_id` / `entity_id`** on every PS06 entity, with **data-layer scoping** (an unscoped query is rejected, not defaulted to "all"; Platform §0.1).

### 2.3 In-scope / Out-of-scope boundary table

| Capability | In PS06 | Owned/relied elsewhere |
|---|---|---|
| Sanctioned strength & vacancy computation | ✅ | Post sanction orders may originate from establishment authority (master data, PS01/org master) |
| Qualifying-service ledger & exclusions | ✅ | Source leave/EOL/suspension facts from PS03/PS09; service dates from PS01 |
| Multi-stream seniority computation & lists | ✅ | Source person/job/grade data from PS01 + org/grade masters (`VAL-GRADE-BAND`) |
| Eligibility rule engine (APAR-usability, certificate currency) | ✅ | APAR ratings + communication status from **PS08**; disciplinary/vigilance from **PS09** |
| DPC / panel proceedings, panel currency | ✅ (logic) | DPC convening/approval **runs on P01** (committee-as-workflow); SoD by P01/P02 |
| Promotion orders, refusal consequence & probation | ✅ | Document storage **PS13**; order issue is a P01 maker-checker flow |
| Officiating/ad-hoc/in-situ | ✅ | — |
| ACP/MACP sanction | ✅ (sanction) | Pay fixation arithmetic & disbursement **PS10** |
| Posting movement execution | ✅ (initiate) | Relieving/joining mechanics reuse **PS05** |
| Legal-case linkage & sub-judice flags | ✅ | Court case management itself is external; PS06 stores references only |
| Correction-lineage & re-rank cascade | ✅ | Pay stepping-up arithmetic executed by **PS10** (PS06 detects & flags) |
| Increment monitoring | ✅ (monitoring/alerting view only) | **PS10 is system-of-record & executor** for increments and stepping-up |
| Service event ledger | Writes events | Ledger owned by **PS12** (on P05 substrate) |
| Workflow / RBAC / audit / jobs / notifications / migration engines | Consumed by id | **P01 / P02 / P05 / X.1 / X.2 / P06** — never re-authored |
| Career-path/succession/9-box (advisory) | ✅ (advisory, optional) | Competency master **PS07**; enterprise analytics **PS14** — PS06 must not duplicate |

**Talent-layer boundary note (improvement #21):** FR-PPP-014 (career-path, succession, 9-box) is explicitly **advisory and optional**. It consumes competencies from **PS07** and feeds analytics to **PS14**; it must **not** auto-promote, must not be a source of truth for competencies, and must be built lighter than the litigation-bearing kernels (FR-016 qualifying service, FR-006 roster, FR-004 zone, FR-020 multi-stream seniority).

### 2.4 Assumptions & dependencies

- **PS01** provides authoritative `employees` (+ public-sector `service_no`, `cadre`, `pay_scale_id`, posting history per Reconciliation §D), with `designations`, `cadres`, `pay_scales` and `org_units` from the **employee + org/grade masters** (`VAL-GRADE-BAND`, `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`, `VAL-ORG-NOCYCLE`). PS06 **references, never forks** these.
- Establishment/sanction authority provides post-sanction master data feeding `sanctioned_posts`.
- **PS08** exposes a stable APAR read API returning per-year grading + benchmark band **and `communicated`/`representation_status`** (improvement #2); PS06 consumes it by reference (does not fork APAR).
- **PS09** exposes a disciplinary/vigilance status read API **and emits case-conclusion events** (sealed cover); degrades to scheduled reconciliation (a `JOB-PS06-SEALED-RECONCILE` on X.1) if only status read is available (improvement #19).
- **PS10** consumes the MACP/promotion pay event, **is system-of-record for increments**, and executes **stepping-up** on a pay-anomaly signal (improvements #7, #18).
- **PS12** accepts SR event writes idempotently via the canonical **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`**, deduped on the tuple `(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id, source_event_version)` with mandatory `fact_key` + explicit `tenant_id`/`entity_id`, on the P05 substrate (§9.7.1).
- **PS05** provides the relieving/joining workflow (configured P01 flow) that PPP-POST hands a promotion-posting movement to.
- Reservation policy parameters (percentages, roster cycle length, enabling-provision references) are configurable master data following the **platform config cascade** (platform → tenant → entity → employee; Platform §0.3), not hard-coded.

## Section 3 — Roles & Permissions

### 3.1 Module roles — mapped to RBAC v1.7 (ADDITIONS, not a parallel scheme)

The access-control **model is owned by RBAC Design v1.7**; PS06 statutory actors are expressed as **existing roles**, **new enterprise roles**, or **capability flags ADDED to the taxonomy** and registered in RBAC §4.3/§2.2 (Reconciliation §C; PLATFORM_FOUNDATION §6.6). SoD is enforced by P01/P02.

| PS06 actor | RBAC v1.7 expression | SoD / scope note |
|---|---|---|
| Employee (Self-Service) | existing **Employee** role (RBAC §2.4) | own-record scope; cannot view others' comparative data |
| Establishment/Seniority Officer | **new entity-scoped role** `ps06_establishment_officer` | Maker for seniority; cannot self-approve publication |
| Establishment-Strength Officer | **new role / capability flag** `ps06_strength_officer` | Independent of case maker; vacancy figures audited (P05) |
| HR Officer (Promotion Desk) | **HR Administrator** (RBAC §2.2) + `ps06_promotion_desk` flag | Maker; cannot be a panel member on own case (P02 SoD) |
| Reservation/Roster Officer | **new role** `ps06_roster_officer` | Independent control on DPC select list |
| Vigilance Clearance Officer | **new role / capability flag** `ps06_vigilance_clearance` | Reads from PS09; attests clearance (case-scoped entitlement) |
| DPC Secretary | **new role** `ps06_dpc_secretary` | Convenes DPC (P01 initiator); cannot vote/grade |
| **DPC Member / Panel Member** | **new role** `ps06_dpc_member` (added role + capability flag) | P01 `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` approver; cannot be in own promotion field |
| **Appointing Authority** | **new role** `ps06_appointing_authority` (mirrors Disciplinary/Appointing Authority pattern, §6.6) | P01 checker/`DYNAMIC_APPROVER`; maker ≠ checker enforced by P02 |
| **Reviewing Authority** | **new role** `ps06_reviewing_authority` (added role + capability flag) | Review-DPC / supersession review approver on P01 |
| Department Head | **HOD** (RBAC §2.3) + per-workflow approval capability toggle | Sanctions officiating/posting decisions (P01 approver) |
| Legal/Litigation Officer | **new role** `ps06_legal_officer` | Writes only to legal entities; cannot adjudicate promotion |
| SR Custodian (PS12) | **new role + capability flag on the PS12 SR ledger** (§6.6) | Read-only into PS06; reconciliation on P05 query contract |
| Auditor | **map to** Org-Admin audit read + read-only entitlement (RBAC §3.2; P05 `Audit.query`) | No write; never a parallel "Auditor" role with write |
| System Administrator | **map to** Org Admin / Platform Super Admin (RBAC §2.1) | Config, master data, RBAC; no transactional self-approval |

**MFA:** the high-privilege statutory roles (Appointing Authority, Reviewing Authority, DPC Member, Legal Officer) require **MFA equivalently to HR Admin/Org Admin** (Platform §3.1; Vision §2.2).

### 3.2 Permission matrix (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, A=Approve, X=none) — enforced by P02 `Authorization.check`

> Every endpoint calls **`Authorization.check({subject(roles,scope), action, resource_ref, fields[]})`**; it never re-implements permission logic (Platform §P02). Field masks (APAR/disciplinary/category) are applied **on serialization**, so an over-broad query cannot leak a masked field.

## Section 4 — Shared Application Foundation (consumed from PrimeSoft platform)

This module **consumes** the PrimeSoft platform contracts by id (Foundation §9; Reconciliation §C/§E). It does **not** restate them as new requirements and does **not** re-author any engine:

- **Multi-tenancy:** every PS06 table carries non-nullable **`tenant_id`** and, where entity-scoped, **`entity_id`**; scoping is enforced at the **data/persistence layer**; an unscoped query is **rejected** (Platform §0.1).
- **Auth:** Google SSO (OAuth 2.0) / username-password / **MFA (TOTP/SMS OTP)** for high-privilege roles; JWT bearer carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; permissions resolved **per request by P02**, never carried raw in the session (Platform §0.2, §3.1).
- **API conventions (Foundation §1):** `/api/v1`; **`Idempotency-Key`** on unsafe transaction-creating POSTs (24h replay returns the original); **cursor pagination** (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100 + `cursor=` → `next_cursor`); `?sort=field:asc|desc`; **`X-Correlation-Id`** on every request, echoed and written to every audit/log line; effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` and are **staged** by an effective-date job, not written live.
- **Canonical error envelope (Foundation §1; Reconciliation §C):** `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "field": "...", "details": { } } }`; the correlation id is the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header**, not a body `requestId`. 2xx returns the resource payload.
- **Standard error codes (Foundation §1, 8-code table):** `VALIDATION_FAILED(422)`, `UNAUTHENTICATED(401)`, `FORBIDDEN(403)`, `NOT_FOUND(404)`, `CONFLICT(409)`, `PRECONDITION_FAILED(412)`, `RATE_LIMITED(429)`, `INTERNAL(500)` + PS06 module codes (Section 9). The invented `VALIDATION_ERROR(400)`/`AUTH_REQUIRED(401)`/`INTERNAL_ERROR(500)`/`UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE(503)` are **overridden** (Reconciliation §C).
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP ASVS, TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest, **P05 dual-log audit** (100% mutation capture, immutable, ≥7-yr; tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** hash-chaining), DPDP Act 2023 alignment **with a module DPIA for the eligibility snapshot** (§10.2), statutory retention floors.
- **NFR baseline (Platform §8.2; Reconciliation §C):** standard API **p95 < 500ms @ 300 concurrent**; read-heavy p95 < 300ms cached / < 1000ms uncached; writes p95 < 1500ms; **uptime 99.5%/month**; **RTO < 4h, RPO < 1h**; WCAG 2.1 AA; soft delete only.
- **Platform engines consumed:** **P01** WorkflowEngine (`workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`, 5 patterns, in-flight version pinning, SLA/escalation), **P02** Authorization.check, **P05** Audit (`audit_log`/`security_audit_log`), **P06** Migration ETL+V, **X.1** Jobs runner, **X.2** Notification infra, **X.3** Integration framework, **W.1/W.2/W.3** configured flows/forms/notification-config. PS06 **configures** flows and forms; it never codes bespoke workflow/forms/audit.
- **Validation library (Foundation §2):** PS06 cites platform `VAL-*` ids (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`, `VAL-DATE`, `VAL-DOB`, `VAL-ENUM`, `VAL-FILE`, `VAL-COMMENT`, `VAL-GRADE-BAND`, `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`, `VAL-ORG-NOCYCLE`, `VAL-CONSENT`) and authors only module-unique **`VAL-PS06-*`** rules (Section 9.6), registered in the Foundation index.

## Section 5 — Holistic Data Model

> **Platform grounding of the data model.** Every entity below carries **`tenant_id`** (non-null) and, where entity-scoped, **`entity_id`** (Platform §0.1). "std audit fields" means the platform soft-delete/lineage columns; **audit rows are written by the P05 DB trigger**, not by application code, so PS06 does **not** define an `audit_log`. `service_register_events` is the **PS12 net-new enterprise ledger on the P05 substrate** (not a platform primitive). Workflow linkage uses **P01** `workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions` (not `workflow_tasks`). `employees`/`designations`/`cadres`/`pay_scales` are the **PS01 + org/grade masters** (referenced, never redefined); `org_units`, `documents` (PS13), `notifications` (X.2) are platform/sibling-owned and referenced.

### 5.6 Data integrity rules

1. **Unique rank per list:** `(seniority_list_id, rank_position)` and `(seniority_list_id, employee_id)` both unique; ranks contiguous (1..N) on publish.
2. **Single active final list per scope:** at most one `seniority_lists` with `list_type=FINAL, status=FINALISED` per `(cadre_id, grade_designation_id, org_unit_scope_id)`; superseding one flips the prior to `SUPERSEDED`.
3. **Eligibility immutability after DPC:** `eligibility_assessments` for a case are frozen (copy-on-write snapshot) once the case reaches `DPC_HELD`; the cited `qsl_snapshot_id` is itself immutable.
4. **Selected ⇒ eligible:** `promotion_candidates.is_selected=true` requires linked `eligibility_assessment.overall_result ∈ {ELIGIBLE, SEALED_COVER}` (sealed cover kept sealed, not effected until cleared).
5. **Vacancy cap from establishment:** count of `is_selected=true` candidates ≤ `promotion_cases.vacancy_count`, and `vacancy_count` MUST equal the promotion-quota vacancies computed from the linked `sanctioned_posts` (not free-entered) (impr. #1; `VAL-PS06-VACANCY-RECON`). Reserve list excluded from cap.
6. **Own-merit migration (impr. #3):** a `roster_points.status=FILLED` row links exactly one `filled_by_employee_id`; if the filling candidate `selected_on_own_merit=true`, the point's `adjusted_against_category` MUST be set to an **unreserved (GEN)** point and the candidate must occupy a UR point — a reserved point is **not** consumed. A reserved point cannot be filled by a non-matching category unless `DE_RESERVED`/`INTERCHANGED` with `dereservation_authority_ref`.
7. **Order references valid candidate:** a `REGULAR_PROMOTION`/`LDCE_PROMOTION` order requires `candidate_id` with `dpc_verdict=FIT` and `is_selected=true`.
8. **No self-adjudication:** an employee appearing in `promotion_candidates` for a case cannot be a `promotion_panel_members` member of that case's panel (must `RECUSED`). **Enforced by P02 SoD** (maker ≠ checker, multi-role intersection), not re-coded.
9. **SR posting completeness:** every `promotion_orders.status=EFFECTED`, `promotion_postings.status=JOINED`, `financial_upgradations.status=EFFECTED`, and `correction_events.cascade_status=COMPLETED` (with SR impact) must have a non-null `sr_event_id`/`sr_correction_event_id` (PS12 append, idempotent on `source_reference_id`).
10. **MACP cap (CORRECTED — impr. #13):** at most **3 financial up-gradations** in a career across schemes. Regular promotions **reduce the remaining MACP entitlement** (and may reset the MACP clock per `clock_reset_date`); they do **not** form a combined `promotions + macp ≤ 3` cap. Formally: `count(financial_upgradations EFFECTED) ≤ 3`, and each regular promotion since the last up-gradation resets the qualifying clock.
11. **Probation arithmetic:** `scheduled_end = probation_start + probation_months`; declaration only when `status ∈ {ON_PROBATION, EXTENDED}` and the probation period has lapsed.
12. **Effective dates monotonic:** `promotion_orders.effective_date ≥ DPC approval date` unless `notional_date` recorded with authority reference (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`); see §5.8 for the date hierarchy.
13. **Soft delete:** statutory entities (orders, SR-linked, finalised lists, QSL snapshots, correction events) cannot be hard-deleted; only `SUPERSEDED`/`CANCELLED`/lineage with audit (Platform §8.2 — no hard delete platform-wide).
14. **Transactional writes:** select-list approval (candidates + proceedings + roster points + **P01 workflow advance**), order issue (order + **PS12 SR event** + **X.2 notification**), MACP sanction (upgradation + order + SR event + **PS10 pay event**), refusal processing (refusal + MACP-clock effect), and correction-event cascade (recompute + SR correction + **PS10 pay-anomaly signal**) each execute in a single DB transaction; cross-service side effects (SR/notify/PS10) use the **P01 idempotent-action + Idempotency-Key** contract so a retry produces one effect, not two.
15. **Sanctioned-strength consistency (impr. #1):** `filled_count ≤ sanctioned_strength`; `current_vacancies = sanctioned_strength − filled_count`; quota percentages sum ≤ 100 (`VAL-PS06-QUOTA-SPLIT`); FR-012 posting validates the destination `to_sanctioned_post_id` has `current_vacancies > 0`.
16. **APAR-usability gate (impr. #2):** if `eligibility_rules.require_apar_communicated=true`, any below-benchmark/adverse APAR year used against an employee MUST have `apar_communicated=true` with `apar_representation_status ∈ {DISPOSED, NOT_APPLICABLE}`; otherwise `apar_usable=false` and that entry cannot be relied upon — the DPC verdict cannot record supersession citing an unusable entry. APAR facts are read from **PS08** (not forked).
17. **Panel currency (impr. #11):** a promotion order can be generated only while `now ≤ promotion_panels.panel_valid_until`; an `EXPIRED` panel requires a `SUPPLEMENTARY_DPC`/`REVIEW_DPC` re-validation before further orders.
18. **Refusal consequence (impr. #12):** on `promotion_orders.acceptance_status=DECLINED`, a `promotion_refusals` row MUST be created with `debarment_until` and a `macp_clock_effect`; while `status=ACTIVE` the employee is barred from re-consideration before `next_consideration_after`, and the MACP engine applies the recorded clock effect.
19. **Increment ownership (impr. #18):** `increment_monitor` rows are **mirrors** keyed by `ps10_increment_ref`; PS06 never sets the authoritative release/withhold — it reflects **PS10**. A row without `ps10_increment_ref` is an alert-only projection.
20. **Sub-judice guard (impr. #5):** when a `legal_case_links` row with `interim_stay=true` is active on an entity, the entity transitions to `INTERIM_STAYED` and downstream effecting (order effect, finalisation, posting) is blocked until the stay is vacated or the case disposed (returns `PRECONDITION_FAILED`/`ENTITY_SUB_JUDICE`).
21. **Correction lineage (impr. #6):** any re-rank/recompute of a `FINALISED` list or `EFFECTED` order occurs only via a `correction_events` row (never silent edit); affected QSL snapshots are superseded (new `qsl_snapshot_id`), and `pay_anomaly_flag` triggers the **PS10** stepping-up signal where a junior would draw more than a senior (impr. #7).

### 5.8 Reckoning Dates reference box (improvement #17)

Five dates govern this module. They are **distinct** and must never be conflated by an implementing agent.

| Date | Entity field | Definition | Governs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **as-on date** | `seniority_lists.as_on_date` | The date on which seniority position is reckoned for a list | Seniority ordering, eligibility-zone construction |
| **crucial date** | `promotion_cases.crucial_date` | The cut-off date on which eligibility (qualifying service, APAR window, certificate currency) is judged for a case | Eligibility computation, QSL `as_of_date`, creamy-layer/EWS currency |
| **panel / vacancy year** | `promotion_cases.vacancy_year`, `promotion_panels.panel_valid_*` | The DPC cycle the vacancies belong to and the panel's currency window | Vacancy attribution, panel validity, select-panel expiry |
| **effective date** | `promotion_orders.effective_date` | The date the promotion actually takes effect (pay + duties) | Pay fixation hand-off to PS10, duties, increment timing |
| **notional date** | `promotion_orders.notional_date` | A date assigned for seniority/pay-step purposes without immediate arrears (e.g., on sealed-cover exoneration or court order) | Notional seniority, stepping-up, correction cascades |

**Worked relationship example.** Case `PROM/2026/ASO-SO/01`: `vacancy_year = 2026`; `crucial_date = 2026-01-01` (eligibility judged here; QSL computed `as_of 2026-01-01`); seniority list `as_on_date = 2026-01-01`; DPC held 2026-03-20 with `panel_valid_until = 2027-03-19`; order `effective_date = 2026-04-01` (staged via `JOB-PS06-EFFDATE`). A sealed-cover candidate later exonerated (2026-11) is effected with `notional_date = 2026-04-01` (seniority preserved) but arrears only if separately sanctioned — and a `correction_event` re-ranks juniors promoted ahead, raising a PS10 stepping-up signal if any junior now draws more.

## Section 6 — Functional Requirements

> Each FR includes: ID, Module, Primary Role(s), User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Business Rules, Data Model References, API References, UI Behavior Notes, Edge Cases, and a Low-Level Design table. FRs retain stable `FR-PPP-NNN` ids; the owning module is **PS06**. **Platform grounding** is woven into each FR: maker-checker/DPC/approval flows run on **P01**, authz/field-mask via **P02**, audit via **P05**, SR writes to **PS12**, notifications via **X.2**, jobs on **X.1**, migration via **P06**; cross-module reads are by reference (PS08 APAR, PS09 vigilance) and never forked.

### FR-PPP-001 — Cadre-wise Seniority List Generation (multi-stream aware)

- **Module:** PPP-SEN
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment/Seniority Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker, P01 approver)
- **User Story:** As an Establishment Officer, I want to generate a cadre/grade-scoped seniority list reckoned on a chosen date — correctly merging direct recruits, promotees and LDCE qualifiers under the applicable rota-quota — so that promotions and eligibility zones rest on a defensible combined seniority order.
- **Description:** System assembles all employees in a feeder grade within scope (from the **PS01** employee + org/grade masters), tags each with `recruitment_stream`, computes a provisional rank using a configurable reckoning basis, applies tie-breakers, and where the grade is multi-stream applies the `seniority_quota_rules` rota-quota rotation (see FR-020) to interleave streams, tags reservation category, and produces a `DRAFT` list.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Given a cadre + grade + as-on date, the system lists every active employee in that feeder grade within org scope (P02 scope filter), each tagged with `recruitment_stream`.
2. Ranks are contiguous (1..N) with no duplicates or gaps.
3. When `is_multi_stream=true`, ranks follow the linked `quota_rule_id` rotation; each entry records its `quota_slot_label` and `rotation_cycle_no`.
4. Tie-breaks apply deterministically and the applied basis is recorded per entry.
5. The draft is editable until publication; every manual rank override is captured by the **P05** audit trigger with a reason.
6. Reservation category is populated from PS01 and shown per entry.

**Business Rules**
- Reckoning basis precedence and tie-break order are configuration (config cascade Platform §0.3), not code.
- Multi-stream rotation uses the rota-quota rule effective on `as_on_date`; unfilled quota slots carry forward per the rule.
- Officers on deputation/long leave are included with a status flag but retain seniority position.
- An employee may appear in exactly one active list per scope.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `seniority_lists` | Create draft header (`is_multi_stream`, `quota_rule_id`) |
| `seniority_entries` | Ranked rows (stream/quota fields) |
| `seniority_quota_rules` | Rota-quota rotation (FR-020) |
| `employees`, `designations`, `cadres` (PS01 masters) | Source population |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/seniority-lists` | Create + auto-generate entries (`Idempotency-Key`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/seniority-lists/{id}` | Fetch list + entries (cursor pagination) |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/seniority-lists/{id}/entries/{entryId}` | Manual rank override (audited by P05) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Wizard (scope → basis → stream/quota → preview ranked grid) — a **W.2 form** with `VAL-*` bindings. Stream column with colour legend; rotation-slot badge; drag-to-reorder with mandatory reason modal (`VAL-COMMENT`); export to PDF preview. Canonical UI states (empty/loading/error/no-permission/partial) per Foundation §3.

**Edge Cases:** identical DOJ and DOB (fall to next tie-break); employee with grade entry date missing (flagged, excluded until resolved); retro-regularisation altering position; quota slot exhausted in a stream (carry-forward per rule); single-stream grade (rotation skipped).

**LLD**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SeniorityListController`, `SeniorityComputationService`, `RotaQuotaResolver`, `TieBreakResolver`, `SeniorityRepository` |
| Backend Flow | Validate scope → query feeder-grade population from PS01 → tag streams → apply reckoning basis → if multi-stream apply rota-quota rotation → resolve ties → assign 1..N → persist header+entries in one tx |
| Data Operations | INSERT `seniority_lists` (DRAFT); bulk INSERT `seniority_entries`; **P05 trigger** auto-audits each |
| Validation | Scope exists; as-on date not future beyond config (`VAL-DATE`); population non-empty; quota rule active if multi-stream |
| Authorization | `Authorization.check` action `seniority.list.create` + org-unit scope (P02) |
| State Changes & Side Effects | List → DRAFT; P05 audit rows; no SR posting |
| Failure Handling | Missing grade-entry date → partial result with `flagged_entries[]`; tx rollback on any constraint breach |
| Dependencies | PS01 master data; FR-020 quota rules |
| Test Guidance | tie-break determinism; rota-quota rotation vector (Appendix D.4); contiguous-rank invariant; override audit |

### FR-PPP-002 — Tentative Seniority Publication, Objections & Finalisation

- **Module:** PPP-SEN
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment Officer, Employee (objector), Appointing Authority (checker, P01)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to view the tentative seniority list and file objections within the statutory window so that errors are corrected before the list is finalised.
- **Description:** Publishes a draft as `PUBLISHED_TENTATIVE` via a **P01 maker-checker flow**, opens a configurable objection window, lets in-scope employees file objections (including `STREAM_QUOTA_ERROR`) through a **W.2 form**, routes for disposal, applies upheld corrections via the correction-lineage path (FR-018) when post-finalisation, then finalises (`FINALISED`) and notifies via **X.2** with a notified PDF stored in **PS13**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Publication requires checker approval via the **P01** workflow and freezes the entry set as the tentative baseline.
2. Objections accepted only within `[objection_window_start, objection_window_end]`; late ones marked `TIME_BARRED` unless condoned (`ERR-PAST-DATED`).
3. Each objection has a recorded disposal (UPHELD/REJECTED/PARTIALLY_UPHELD) with remarks; objector is notified (X.2).
4. Upheld objections trigger a re-rank that preserves contiguity and is fully audited (P05); post-finalisation re-ranks route through a `correction_event` (FR-018).
5. Finalisation supersedes any prior final list for the scope and produces a notified PDF stored in PS13 (via W.1 Document-Generation stage).

**Business Rules**
- Objections after window close are auto-`TIME_BARRED` unless an authority grants condonation.
- Finalisation blocked while any objection is `SUBMITTED`/`UNDER_REVIEW`, or while the list is `INTERIM_STAYED` (sub-judice, §5.6-20).
- A finalised list is corrected only via a fresh superseding list or a `correction_event`.

### FR-PPP-003 — Configurable Eligibility Rule Engine & Computation (APAR-usability + certificate currency)

- **Module:** PPP-ELG
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (rule config), HR Promotion Officer (run), Vigilance Officer (attest)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want the system to compute each employee's promotion eligibility against configured rules — citing the single qualifying-service ledger, honouring the APAR-communication (Dev Dutt) gate, and validating certificate currency — so that the eligible field is objective, explainable, and audit-proof.
- **Description:** Evaluates qualifying service (cited from `qualifying_service_ledger`, FR-016), APAR benchmark **and usability** (read by reference from **PS08** incl. communication/representation status), vigilance/disciplinary status (**PS09**), mandatory qualification / LDCE exam result, OBC creamy-layer & EWS certificate currency on the crucial date, and roster applicability, producing an `eligibility_assessments` record with overall result, an explainable `rule_trace_json`, and itemised pass/fail reasons. The APAR/disciplinary/category PII concentration is **P02 field-masked on serialization**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Qualifying service is **not recomputed here** — it is cited from the current `qualifying_service_ledger` snapshot for the employee/grade as of `crucial_date` (`qsl_snapshot_id`).
2. APAR pass = at least `apar_min_count_meeting_benchmark` of last `apar_lookback_years` meet `apar_benchmark`, counting only **usable** entries (APAR read from PS08).
3. **APAR-usability gate (impr. #2):** an adverse/below-benchmark entry with `apar_communicated=false` or `apar_representation_status=PENDING` is marked `apar_usable=false` and **cannot be relied on**; the trace records this.
4. **Certificate currency (impr. #16):** for reserved candidates, `obc_creamy_layer_status` and `ews_cert_valid_on_crucial_date` are validated as of `crucial_date`; expired/creamy ⇒ category benefit not applied (reason code recorded).
5. **LDCE channel (impr. #14):** when `eligibility_rules.requires_exam_pass=true`, a linked `exam_results.result=PASS` (current) is required; else `EXAM_NOT_PASSED`.
6. Pending disciplinary charge ⇒ `SEALED_COVER`; current penalty ⇒ `NOT_ELIGIBLE` (per rule flags). Every assessment stores an explainable reason set. Re-running re-computes only `DRAFT`/`FIELD_ASSEMBLED` cases; frozen post `DPC_HELD`.

**Business Rules**
- Rules are version-effective-dated (config cascade); the rule effective on `crucial_date` applies.
- Missing APAR years treated per policy (counted as below-benchmark or as gap-blocking alert).
- Vigilance "not cleared" overrides APAR pass.
- The APAR snapshot (`apar_detail_json`) is **P02 field-masked PII** with an explicit `apar_snapshot_retention_until` (§10.2); purge via `JOB-PS06-APAR-PURGE`.

### FR-PPP-004 — Promotion Case Creation & Eligible-Field Assembly (vacancy from establishment; zone formula pinned)

- **Module:** PPP-DPC
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to create a promotion case whose vacancy count is derived from the sanctioned-post register and assemble the zone of consideration using the pinned DoPT slab so that the DPC evaluates the correct field.
- **Description:** Creates a `promotion_cases` record with `vacancy_count` **derived and validated from the linked `sanctioned_posts`** (promotion-quota vacancies + anticipated + carried-forward), computes the zone of consideration using the pinned non-linear slab (Appendix D.1) with reserved-category extended zone, pulls candidates from the final seniority list, links eligibility assessments, and marks zone bands.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Case requires a finalised seniority list for the feeder grade/scope **and** a linked `sanctioned_posts` row.
2. `vacancy_count` equals the computed promotion-quota vacancies from `sanctioned_posts`; manual override requires authority and is audited (`VAL-PS06-VACANCY-RECON`).
3. Zone of consideration computed from the pinned slab (Appendix D.1), not a flat multiplier; reserved-category extended zone applied where roster requires.
4. Candidates ordered by seniority; each links to its eligibility assessment.
5. Case status advances DRAFT → FIELD_ASSEMBLED → ELIGIBILITY_DONE.

**Business Rules**
- Vacancy count must reconcile to `sanctioned_posts.current_vacancies` (promotion quota) (impr. #1); a mismatch blocks assembly.
- Zone slab and extended-zone rules are configurable but **pinned to a worked example** (Appendix D.1).
- Out-of-zone candidates retained for audit but not placed before DPC unless zone extended with authority.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `promotion_cases`, `promotion_candidates` | case + field |
| `sanctioned_posts` | vacancy source |

| GET | `/api/v1/promotion-cases/{id}/candidates` | List candidates (cursor) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Case header with vacancy card sourced from sanctioned-strength (sanctioned/filled/vacant); zone summary; candidate table with zone band colouring and eligibility chips; "Assemble Field" preview of in/out of zone.

**Edge Cases:** vacancy figure mismatched with establishment (blocked, `VACANCY_NOT_RECONCILED`); insufficient eligible candidates (under-fill warning); tied seniority at zone boundary (include both); reserved vacancies exceed eligible reserved candidates (carry-forward trigger).

### FR-PPP-005 — DPC / Promotion Panel Constitution & Proceedings (with panel currency; committee-as-P01-workflow)

- **Module:** PPP-DPC
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer (constitute), DPC Secretary, DPC Members, Appointing Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As a DPC Secretary, I want to constitute the committee with a defined validity window, record attendance/quorum, capture each candidate's fitness verdict against the benchmark (using only usable APAR), and compile a select list so that the promotion decision is statutorily valid and not issued from a stale panel.
- **Description:** Constitutes a `promotion_panels` as a **P01 workflow instance** (committee-as-workflow; Platform §P01, §W.1) with members resolved as **`PARALLEL_ALL_OF`** approver branches and a `panel_valid_from`/`panel_valid_until` window, records `dpc_proceedings`, captures per-candidate `dpc_verdict` (supersession cannot cite an unusable APAR entry), builds select/reserve/sealed-cover lists, and routes for **appointing-authority approval as a `DYNAMIC_APPROVER` stage**. Supports `SUPPLEMENTARY_DPC`/`REVIEW_DPC` for missed/sealed candidates. **SoD (candidate ≠ member, maker ≠ checker) enforced by P02.**

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Panel constitution validates quorum config and conflict-of-interest recusal (candidate cannot be member — P02 SoD).
2. Panel records `panel_valid_from`/`panel_valid_until`; orders cannot be generated after expiry without a supplementary/review DPC (impr. #11).
3. Each in-zone candidate receives a verdict (member approvals joined via `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`); sealed-cover candidates flagged and excluded from effected select list; **supersession citing an unusable APAR entry is blocked** (impr. #2).
4. Select-list count ≤ vacancy count; reserve list ordered.
5. Approval by appointing authority is a **P01 checker step** distinct from the secretary/maker.

**Business Rules**
- Quorum must be met for a valid sitting; otherwise meeting recorded as adjourned.
- Benchmark applied must match the rule's `apar_benchmark` unless an authority records a deviation.
- Supersession (placing a junior above a senior) requires recorded reasons **and** only usable APAR material.
- An expired panel (`status=EXPIRED`) blocks order generation (integrity rule §5.6-17).
- The DPC flow is a **configured W.1 flow definition** executed by P01; in-flight panels run the pinned definition version (Platform §P01).

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `promotion_panels`, `promotion_panel_members` | committee + currency (+ `workflow_instance_id`) |
| `dpc_proceedings` | meeting record |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Panel builder with recusal warnings and validity-window picker; live quorum indicator; panel-currency countdown; verdict grid with benchmark reference and APAR-usability lock on superseded entries; minutes upload (PS13); select-list approval with vacancy/roster reconciliation panel. Uses the **P01 approval action bar** (approve/reject/send-back/delegate) per Foundation §3.

**Edge Cases:** member recuses mid-meeting dropping below quorum; benchmark deviation; supersession blocked by unusable APAR; panel expiring before orders issued (supplementary DPC); sealed-cover candidate later cleared (FR-008).

### FR-PPP-006 — Reservation Roster Management & Compliance (own-merit migration; enabling justification)

- **Module:** PPP-ROS
- **Primary Role(s):** Reservation/Roster Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker, P01)
- **User Story:** As a Roster Officer, I want to maintain the reservation roster, correctly migrate own-merit reserved candidates to unreserved points, hold the Nagaraj enabling justification, and validate compliance so that reservation policy is demonstrably and defensibly applied.
- **Description:** Maintains `reservation_rosters` (with `enabling_provision_ref`, `quantifiable_data_doc_id` in PS13, `consequential_seniority_mode`, `roster_applicable`) and `roster_points`, assigns selected candidates to points by category, **migrates own-merit reserved candidates to unreserved points** (`adjusted_against_category=GEN`, reserved point preserved), handles carry-forward and de-reservation/interchange with authority (P01 checker), and produces a compliance report itemising own-merit migrations and recomputed category tallies.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Each selected candidate maps to a roster point matching their category, or — if `selected_on_own_merit=true` — to an **unreserved** point with `adjusted_against_category=GEN`, leaving the reserved point un-consumed (impr. #3).
2. Unfilled reserved points are carried forward (linked) rather than silently dropped; de-reservation requires `dereservation_authority_ref`.
3. Compliance report shows points filled vs. due per category, **itemises own-merit migrations**, and flags deviations and 50%-ceiling/PwBD-horizontal breaches.
4. Roster carries the enabling-provision reference and quantifiable-data document for reservation-in-promotion (Nagaraj/Jarnail); `consequential_seniority_mode` recorded (impr. #15).
5. Roster point cannot be double-filled; grades with `roster_applicable=false` (single-post cadre) are exempt.

**Business Rules**
- Reservation percentages and cycle size are policy configuration (config cascade); own-merit candidates **never** consume reserved points.
- Backlog/carry-forward vacancies prioritised before fresh points; de-reservation only after the policy carry-forward limit.
- PwBD horizontal reservation interpolated across categories per policy.
- Consequential seniority vs catch-up applied per `consequential_seniority_mode` for accelerated reserved promotions.

| GET | `/api/v1/promotion-cases/{id}/roster-compliance` | Compliance report (with migrations) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** 100/200-point roster grid with category legend; filled/vacant/carried-forward/de-reserved states; **own-merit migration indicator** (reserved point shown preserved); compliance panel with category tallies, migration list and deviation flags; de-reserve modal with mandatory authority; enabling-justification upload (PS13).

**Edge Cases:** reserved candidate tops UR merit (migrated to UR, reserved point preserved — the canonical N.R. Parmar/own-merit case); no eligible reserved candidate (carry-forward then possible de-reservation); SC/ST interchange; EWS overlap; over-reservation breaching 50% ceiling (warning); single-post cadre (roster exempt).

### FR-PPP-007 — Promotion Order Generation, Acceptance, Refusal & SR Posting

- **Module:** PPP-ORD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker, P01)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to generate promotion orders for selected candidates, capture acceptance or refusal (triggering refusal consequences), optionally mark an order "subject to litigation outcome", and post to the Digital SR so that the promotion is legally effected and permanently recorded.
- **Description:** Generates `promotion_orders` from approved select-list candidates (only while the panel is current), produces the order document via the **W.1 Document-Generation stage** into **PS13**, captures acceptance/decline (declined → FR-019 refusal consequence; non-response → `DEEMED_ACCEPTED`), supports `subject_to_litigation`, transitions to `EFFECTED`, and writes an idempotent **SR event to PS12** — transactionally. Order issue is a **P01 maker-checker flow**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Orders generate only for `is_selected=true, dpc_verdict=FIT` candidates **and** while `panel_valid_until` not passed (impr. #11).
2. Each order carries from/to designation + pay scale, effective (and optional notional) date; `subject_to_litigation` may be set with a linked `legal_case_links` row (impr. #5).
3. Acceptance window enforced; non-response ⇒ `DEEMED_ACCEPTED`; **decline ⇒ a `promotion_refusals` row is created (FR-019)** with debarment + MACP-clock effect (impr. #12).
4. On `EFFECTED`, an **SR `PROMOTION` event is posted** via the canonical **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** with `sr_event_id` stored — dedup tuple `(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id=order_id, source_event_version)`, mandatory `fact_key` + explicit `tenant_id`/`entity_id` (§9.7.1). This is the **establishment** event only; the **pay-fixation SR event (`PAY_FIXATION`) is PS10's**, not PS06's. `employees.designation_id` update signalled to **PS01**.
5. Order issue + SR posting + notification occur in one transaction; partial failure rolls back. An order under interim stay goes `INTERIM_STAYED`, not `EFFECTED`.

**Business Rules**
- A declined promotion records consequences (FR-019); the next reserve-list candidate may be considered per policy.
- Notional dates require authority reference; affect seniority, not arrears unless sanctioned.
- Order numbering is gap-free per series.
- An order cannot be `EFFECTED` while a linked `legal_case_links.interim_stay=true` is active.

**UI Behavior Notes:** Batch generation with preview and panel-currency check; per-order status chips; acceptance/decline capture; "subject to litigation" toggle linking a court case; "Effect & Post to SR" shows SR confirmation; declined orders surface refusal-consequence summary and reserve-list suggestion.

**Edge Cases:** SR (PS12) unavailable at effect (held in `ISSUED`, retried, not falsely EFFECTED); duplicate effect (idempotent on SR key + `Idempotency-Key`); candidate retires/dies between selection and order (cancelled, no SR); panel expired before generation (blocked); interim stay arrives mid-process (order → INTERIM_STAYED).

### FR-PPP-008 — Sealed Cover Handling & Deferred/Review DPC (event-driven; periodic-review SLA)

- **Module:** PPP-DPC
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer, Vigilance Officer, Appointing Authority
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to keep promotion recommendations of employees with pending disciplinary/vigilance proceedings in a sealed cover, be reminded to review it on an SLA, and open it on PS09 case conclusion so that due process is honoured.
- **Description:** When eligibility yields `SEALED_COVER`, the DPC assesses fitness but the recommendation is sealed; the post is filled provisionally/kept vacant; the system **subscribes to PS09 conclusion events** (via X.3/event subscription; degrading to scheduled reconciliation `JOB-PS06-SEALED-RECONCILE` if only status read is available — impr. #19) and enforces a **maximum-age / periodic-review SLA**; on conclusion a Review DPC effects (with notional date) or supersedes — including a **partially-upheld minor-penalty branch** (impr. #20). Sealed-cover data is **P02 field-restricted**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Sealed-cover candidates flagged; verdict recorded but not effected; visible only to authorised roles (P02 field-level).
2. The system tracks the linked PS09 case via **event subscription**, with scheduled reconciliation fallback (X.1), and raises `SEALED_COVER_REVIEW_DUE` alerts on the periodic-review SLA (e.g., 2-yearly) (impr. #19).
3. On exoneration, a Review DPC effects the promotion with notional date preserving seniority (and triggers correction cascade if juniors were promoted ahead — FR-018).
4. On major penalty, supersession/deferral per policy; on **partially-upheld minor penalty**, a defined branch decides effect-with-conditions vs deferral, audited (impr. #20).
5. Sealed cover cannot remain open indefinitely; the SLA forces periodic review.

**Business Rules**
- Notional promotion on exoneration carries arrears only if separately sanctioned.
- Minor-penalty branch outcome is policy-configured (effect / defer / supersede).
- PS09 dependency is an **event** by contract; if unavailable, a nightly reconcile job (X.1) polls status (§16.3).

### FR-PPP-009 — Probation Lifecycle on Promotion

- **Module:** PPP-ORD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer, Reporting Manager (input), Appointing Authority (declare)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want promotion to optionally start a probation period that is tracked, extendable, and concluded by a satisfactory declaration so that confirmation in the promoted grade is properly governed.
- **Description:** On effecting a promotion that carries probation, creates `probation_records`, schedules the end date, raises a `PROBATION_ENDING` alert before due (X.2), supports extension or reversion, and records the satisfactory-completion declaration (posting a confirmation **SR event to PS12**). Reuses the platform **Confirmation Workflow** pattern (W.1; Platform §W.1 Confirmation Workflow model).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Probation auto-created when the promotion grade has a configured probation period.
2. `scheduled_end = probation_start + probation_months`.
3. Alert raised configurable days before `scheduled_end` (via `JOB-PS06-PROGRESSION`).
4. Extension records new `extended_to` and reason; reversion transitions employee back and audits (P05).
5. Satisfactory declaration sets `DECLARED_SATISFACTORY` and posts a confirmation SR event (PS12).

**Business Rules**
- Multiple extensions allowed up to a policy cap.
- Reversion during probation reverses the promotion order (`SUPERSEDED`) with SR posting.

### FR-PPP-010 — Ad-hoc / Officiating / In-situ Promotion (superseded-by-regular guard)

- **Module:** PPP-OFF
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer, Department Head, Appointing Authority
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want to place an employee in a higher post on ad-hoc/officiating/in-situ basis pending a regular DPC so that operational continuity is maintained without bypassing due process — and so that when the regular DPC selects a different incumbent, the officiating arrangement is correctly terminated rather than regularised.
- **Description:** Creates `officiating_arrangements` (against a `sanctioned_posts` post) with dates and optional officiating pay, links to a pending regular case, supports extension/termination, regularises into a regular order on DPC selection of the same incumbent, and **transitions to `SUPERSEDED_BY_REGULAR` (terminated, not regularised) when the regular DPC selects someone else** (impr. #20). Sanction = P01 approver (Department Head / Appointing Authority); SR start/end posted to PS12.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Arrangement records type, post (`sanctioned_post_id`), org unit, dates, and pay eligibility.
2. Duration tracked; extensions audited (P05); lapses auto-flagged (X.1).
3. Linking to a regular case enables one-click regularisation **only when the same incumbent is selected**.
4. If the regular DPC selects a different person, the arrangement moves to `SUPERSEDED_BY_REGULAR` and is terminated with SR end event (state guard, impr. #20).
5. Arrangement posts SR events (officiating start/end) to PS12.

**Business Rules**
- Ad-hoc promotion confers no automatic seniority unless regularised.
- Officiating pay allowed only when type/policy permits.
- An employee cannot hold two conflicting upward arrangements for the same post simultaneously.

**Data Model References**

| POST | `/api/v1/officiating/{id}/terminate` | Terminate / superseded-by-regular |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Arrangement form (W.2) with type and pay toggle; active-arrangements list with duration meter; regularise CTA appears when linked case is `SELECT_LIST_APPROVED` and incumbent selected; superseded badge when a different person is selected.

**Edge Cases:** officiating exceeds permissible duration (compliance flag); **regular DPC supersedes officiating incumbent → `SUPERSEDED_BY_REGULAR`, terminated not regularised** (now a state guard); overlapping arrangements (blocked).

### FR-PPP-011 — Financial Up-gradation (ACP/MACP) Sanction (cap corrected; refusal-aware)

- **Module:** PPP-FIN
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer (maker), Screening Committee, Appointing Authority (sanction)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want the system to detect financial up-gradation due-dates from the qualifying-service ledger, run screening and sanction, correctly cap at three financial up-gradations (with regular promotions reducing remaining entitlement and refusals affecting the clock), so that stagnating employees get assured pay progression on time and within policy.
- **Description:** Continuously evaluates qualifying service (cited from `qualifying_service_ledger`) via `JOB-PS06-MACP-DUE` (X.1) to flag `financial_upgradations` as `DUE`, runs a screening-committee assessment (P01 flow), applies the **corrected cap (≤ 3 financial up-gradations in a career; regular promotions reduce remaining entitlement and reset the clock; refusal-of-promotion applies the recorded MACP-clock effect)**, sanctions the next pay level, generates a MACP order (FR-007), posts SR (PS12), and hands the pay event to **PS10**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Due detection on completing configured qualifying service (e.g., 10/20/30 years) **from the QSL net qualifying years**, with no qualifying promotion in the interim.
2. Screening assessment records benchmark-met; failing benchmark defers per policy.
3. **Cap (CORRECTED — impr. #13):** `count(EFFECTED financial up-gradations) ≤ 3`; a regular promotion reduces remaining entitlement and resets the qualifying clock (`clock_reset_date`); there is **no** combined `promotions + macp ≤ 3` rule.
4. **Refusal effect (impr. #12):** an active `promotion_refusals` row with `macp_clock_effect ∈ {STOP, FORFEIT_NEXT, RESET}` is applied (`refusal_effect_applied=true`).
5. Sanction grants the next pay level effective from due date; deferred if penalty current; creates a `MACP` order, posts SR (PS12), emits a pay-fixation event to **PS10**.

**Business Rules**
- MACP counts financial up-gradations availed (cap 3); a regular promotion resets/adjusts the clock per policy.
- Refusal of regular promotion affects MACP entitlement per the recorded `macp_clock_effect` (FR-019).
- Deferral on disciplinary penalty currency; re-evaluated on penalty expiry.

**UI Behavior Notes:** MACP due dashboard with countdown and **cap tracker showing up-gradations availed (n/3)** and remaining-entitlement after regular promotions; refusal-effect badge; screening form with benchmark; sanction action shows pay-level change preview; deferred items with reason.

**Edge Cases:** employee took regular promotion shortly before MACP due (recompute clock via `clock_reset_date`); penalty between due and sanction (defer); refusal forfeits next up-gradation; cap of 3 reached (informational, no further).

### FR-PPP-012 — Posting after Promotion (sanctioned-post validated; NOT_JOINED state)

- **Module:** PPP-POST
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer, Department Head, Appointing Authority
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to post a promoted employee to a specific sanctioned-and-vacant post/station and drive relieving/joining through PS05 so that the promotion translates into an actual placement, with non-joining handled as a defined terminal state.
- **Description:** Creates `promotion_postings` for an effected promotion, selects the destination `to_sanctioned_post_id` (**validated as sanctioned and vacant against `sanctioned_posts`** — impr. #1), hands a movement to **PS05** (configured P01 relieving/joining flow), tracks relieving/joining, supports a **`NOT_JOINED`** terminal state with consequence (impr. #20), and posts the posting/joining **SR event to PS12** on completion.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Posting can be created only for an `EFFECTED` promotion order.
2. Destination post validated against `sanctioned_posts` (`current_vacancies > 0`); no free-text vacancy assumption (impr. #1; `VAL-PS06-VACANCY-RECON`).
3. **PS05** movement reference stored; status reflects RELIEVED/JOINED.
4. Report-by date enforced; **failure to join by deadline ⇒ `NOT_JOINED`** with `not_joined_consequence ∈ {ORDER_REVIEW, FORFEITED, EXTENSION_GRANTED}` (impr. #20).
5. On JOINED, a posting SR event is posted (PS12) and `employees.org_unit_id` update signalled to **PS01**.

**Business Rules**
- A promotion may be local (no station change) or out-station (full relieving/joining via PS05).
- Failure to join by deadline triggers order review per policy; forfeiture frees the sanctioned post.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `promotion_postings` | posting record (+NOT_JOINED) |

| POST | `/api/v1/postings/{id}/mark-not-joined` | Record NOT_JOINED + consequence |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Posting form with destination picker showing sanctioned/vacant status; movement timeline (relieved → in-transit → joined); report-by countdown; NOT_JOINED action with consequence selector.

**Edge Cases:** no vacant sanctioned post (blocked, `POST_NOT_AVAILABLE`); employee declines posting (links to FR-007 acceptance); local promotion (skip relieving); not joined by deadline (NOT_JOINED + consequence).

### FR-PPP-013 — Progression Monitoring (Due-for-Promotion, Stagnation, Increment view)

- **Module:** PPP-MON
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Reporting Manager, Employee (self), System (scheduler X.1)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want the system to proactively flag who is due for promotion, who is stagnating, whose increment is due (mirroring PS10), and whose probation/APAR/refusal-debarment affects progression so that no entitlement is missed and no employee stagnates unseen.
- **Description:** A scheduled engine (`JOB-PS06-PROGRESSION` on X.1) evaluates each employee against career rules (citing the QSL) and generates `progression_alerts` and maintains `increment_monitor` rows **as a monitoring/alerting view that mirrors PS10 (system-of-record)** (impr. #18); surfaces dashboards and self-service timelines (Me workspace); supports acknowledgement/action; dispatches via **X.2**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Alerts generated on configurable lead time before due dates; deduplicated per employee/type/cycle (job idempotent per-period run key, X.1).
2. Stagnation defined as net qualifying years (from QSL) in grade beyond a configurable threshold without promotion/up-gradation.
3. **Increment rows are a mirror keyed by `ps10_increment_ref`; PS06 never authoritatively sets release/withhold — PS10 does** (impr. #18). Rows without a PS10 ref are alert-only projections.
4. Employees see their own progression timeline and open alerts (P02 own-record scope).
5. Alerts can be acknowledged, actioned (linking to a case/MACP), or dismissed with reason; new alert types `SEALED_COVER_REVIEW_DUE`, `REFUSAL_DEBARMENT_ENDING` supported.

**Business Rules**
- Alert thresholds are configuration per cadre/grade (config cascade).
- APAR gaps blocking eligibility raise `APAR_GAP_BLOCKING` to prompt PS08 follow-up.
- Increment withheld due to penalty (PS09) is reflected from PS10 and auto-released on expiry **by PS10**, mirrored here.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `progression_alerts`, `increment_monitor` (mirror) | monitoring |

### FR-PPP-014 — Career-Path Modelling, Succession Planning & Eligibility Dashboard (ADVISORY / OPTIONAL)

- **Module:** PPP-CAR
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, System Administrator (templates), Employee (self view)
- **Scope marker (impr. #21):** This FR is **explicitly advisory and optional**, built **lighter** than the statutory kernels (FR-016/006/004/020). It **consumes** competencies from **PS07** (never redefines them) and **feeds** analytics to **PS14**. It **must not auto-promote** and is not a system of truth for competencies or analytics.
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want to model career paths, maintain succession plans, and view eligibility dashboards so that the organisation plans talent flow and an employee understands their growth route.
- **Description:** Defines `career_paths` with ordered `career_path_stages` (designation, typical tenure, **referenced** PS07 competencies), builds `succession_plans` with ranked `succession_candidates` and readiness levels, and presents an eligibility dashboard projecting who becomes eligible when (reusing the eligibility engine).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. A career path is an ordered sequence of designations with typical tenure and **competency references** (read-only from PS07).
2. Employees can view their mapped career path and next stage with projected eligibility date.
3. Succession plans identify critical positions, incumbents, risk of loss, and ranked successors with readiness.
4. Eligibility dashboard projects upcoming eligible cohorts per grade/cycle.
5. Templates are configurable by admin; plans are versioned. **No path or readiness rating triggers any promotion action.**

**Business Rules**
- Career-path stages must reference valid designations (PS01 master); ordering unique and contiguous.
- Succession readiness derived from tenure, APAR (PS08), and competency coverage (PS07) — advisory only.
- Critical-position risk is set by HR/dept head, not auto-computed.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `career_paths`, `career_path_stages` | path model (advisory) |
| `succession_plans`, `succession_candidates` | succession (advisory) |

### FR-PPP-015 — Sanctioned-Post & Establishment-Strength Register & Vacancy Computation (NEW — improvement #1)

- **Module:** PPP-EST
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment-Strength Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker, P01)
- **User Story:** As an Establishment-Strength Officer, I want to maintain the sanctioned strength per grade/office with the DR/promotion/LDCE quota split and have the system compute promotion-quota vacancies (current, anticipated, carried-forward) so that every promotion case and posting validates against a real establishment, not a free-typed number.
- **Description:** Maintains `sanctioned_posts` (sanctioned strength, filled/vacant, quota split, anticipated & carried-forward vacancies) and computes the **promotion-quota vacancy figure** consumed by FR-004 (case creation) and validated by FR-012 (posting) and FR-010 (officiating). Reconciles filled/anticipated with **PS01** active incumbents and **PS11** superannuation via `JOB-PS06-ESTAB-RECONCILE` (X.1).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Each `sanctioned_posts` row records sanctioned strength, filled count, quota percentages, and a sanction-order reference.
2. `current_vacancies = sanctioned_strength − filled_count`; quota percentages sum ≤ 100 (integrity rule §5.6-15; `VAL-PS06-QUOTA-SPLIT`).
3. Promotion-quota vacancies (current + anticipated + carried-forward × promotion_quota_pct) are computed and exposed to FR-004.
4. FR-012 posting and FR-010 officiating validate the destination/against post has `current_vacancies > 0`.
5. Strength revisions are versioned (`status=REVISED`/`ARCHIVED`) and audited (P05); edits require **P01 checker** approval.

**Business Rules**
- Sanctioned strength originates from establishment-authority sanction orders (master data); edits require checker approval.
- Filled count reconciles with PS01 active incumbents per grade/office on a scheduled sync.
- Anticipated vacancies (retirements within the cycle) are computed from PS01/PS11 superannuation data.

### FR-PPP-016 — Qualifying-Service Ledger & Service-Exclusion Engine (NEW — improvements #8, #9; **GAP (enterprise-specific)** statutory engine)

- **Module:** PPP-QSL
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, System Administrator (exclusion rules), Auditor
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer and auditor, I want one versioned, snapshotted, citable qualifying-service ledger — computed once with pinned exclusion rules (EOL, dies-non, suspension, ad-hoc, deputation) — so that every downstream decision (eligibility, MACP, stagnation, projection) cites the same defensible service fact instead of re-deriving it.
- **Description:** Computes net qualifying service for an `(employee, grade, as-of-date)` by taking gross service and applying the configured `service_exclusion_rules`, persists an **immutable snapshot** (`qualifying_service_ledger`) with an itemised exclusion breakdown, and exposes it as the single source for FR-003/011/013/014. This is a **net-new statutory engine** (Reconciliation §D) that **runs on P05 (audit), P06 (legacy service-book migration)** and consumes PS01/PS03/PS09 facts. Locked as the **fifth shared contract** (`QualifyingServiceLedger`) in §15.4.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. For an `(employee, grade, as-of-date)`, the engine computes `gross_service_years`, applies the linked `service_exclusion_rules`, and persists `net_qualifying_years` with an itemised `exclusion_breakdown_json` (`VAL-PS06-QUALSVC`).
2. Each snapshot is **immutable and citable** (`qsl_snapshot_id`, `computed_by_version`); recomputation creates a new snapshot and supersedes the prior (`superseding_snapshot_id`), never edits it (soft-delete only; P05 trigger captures lineage).
3. Exclusion rules are pinned (Appendix D.3): EOL beyond condonable limit excluded; dies-non excluded; suspension per `suspension_treatment`; ad-hoc counts only if regularised; deputation counts per flag.
4. FR-003 and FR-011 **cite** the current snapshot (`qsl_snapshot_id`) rather than recomputing service.
5. A correction event (FR-018) that changes service facts triggers a fresh snapshot and downstream re-evaluation.

**Business Rules**
- The ledger is the single source of qualifying service for the module (no per-FR calculators) (impr. #8).
- Exclusion rules are version-effective-dated (config cascade); the rule effective on `as_of_date` applies.
- Leave/suspension facts are sourced from **PS03** (leave/EOL) and **PS09** (suspension/penalty) and snapshotted.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `qualifying_service_ledger` | immutable snapshots |
| `service_exclusion_rules` | pinned exclusion logic |
| `employees` (PS01), leave (PS03), suspension (PS09) | inputs (by reference) |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/qualifying-service/compute` | Compute + snapshot (employee, grade, as-of) |
| GET | `/api/v1/employees/{id}/qualifying-service?grade=&asOf=` | Current snapshot |
| GET | `/api/v1/qualifying-service/{snapshotId}` | Fetch immutable snapshot (citable) |
| GET/POST/PUT | `/api/v1/service-exclusion-rules` | Manage exclusion rules |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Service-fact panel showing gross → exclusions (itemised EOL/dies-non/suspension/ad-hoc/deputation) → net; snapshot id + version stamp for citation; exclusion-rule editor with worked-example preview.

**Edge Cases:** suspension later exonerated (recompute via correction); ad-hoc service later regularised (recompute); overlapping EOL and dies-non (no double count); deputation straddling grade change.

### FR-PPP-017 — Legal-Case Linkage & Sub-Judice Handling (NEW — improvement #5)

- **Module:** PPP-LEG
- **Primary Role(s):** Legal/Litigation Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker), HR Officer (read)
- **User Story:** As a Legal Officer, I want to attach court/tribunal references and interim stays to promotion cases, orders, seniority lists and roster points, and mark records "subject to outcome", so that the system truthfully represents that a decision is sub judice and blocks unsafe effecting.
- **Description:** Maintains `legal_case_links` attachable to cases/orders/lists/rosters/candidates with forum, case reference, interim-stay window, and `subject_to_outcome`; sets `subject_to_litigation` on the linked entity; drives the `INTERIM_STAYED` state (integrity rule §5.6-20); and, on an adverse disposal, triggers a correction event (FR-018). Only the **`ps06_legal_officer` role** writes legal links (P02 SoD).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. A legal link can be attached to a `promotion_case`, `promotion_order`, `seniority_list`, `roster`, or `candidate`, capturing forum, reference, petitioner and status.
2. Setting `interim_stay=true` transitions the linked entity to `INTERIM_STAYED` and blocks effecting/finalisation/posting until vacated (impr. #5; `ENTITY_SUB_JUDICE`).
3. An order may be issued `subject_to_outcome=true` ("subject to the outcome of OA/SLP No. …") and is clearly flagged.
4. Disposal status is recorded; `DISPOSED_ADVERSE`/`CONTEMPT` can trigger a `correction_events` row (FR-018).
5. All legal links and stays are audited (P05) and surfaced in the litigation-risk register (§13).

**Business Rules**
- Only the Legal Officer writes legal links; promotion adjudication roles cannot (P02).
- A vacated stay clears `INTERIM_STAYED`, restoring the prior state.
- Court case management itself is external; PS06 stores references and outcomes only.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `legal_case_links` | references, stays, outcomes |
| `promotion_cases`, `promotion_orders`, `seniority_lists`, `roster_points`, `promotion_candidates` | linked entities (subject_to_litigation, INTERIM_STAYED) |

| POST | `/api/v1/legal-case-links/{id}/dispose` | Record outcome |
| GET | `/api/v1/legal-case-links?entityType=&entityId=` | List for entity (cursor) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Legal-link panel on case/order/list views; sub-judice banner with stay dates; "subject to outcome" badge; disposal capture with document upload (PS13); litigation-risk register dashboard.

**Edge Cases:** multiple overlapping cases on one entity; stay vacated then re-imposed; adverse outcome requiring batch re-rank (FR-018); contempt requiring expedited correction.

### FR-PPP-018 — Correction Lineage & Retrospective Recompute Cascade (NEW — improvements #6, #7)

- **Module:** PPP-COR
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment Officer / HR Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker), Legal Officer (court-trigger)
- **User Story:** As an Establishment Officer, when an objection is upheld or a court orders a retrospective promotion/re-rank, I want a single correction mechanism that records why a finalised list or effected order was reopened and cascades the re-rank and recompute truthfully — flagging any pay anomaly to PS10 — so that corrections propagate without silent edits.
- **Description:** Creates a `correction_events` row (reason class OBJECTION_UPHELD / COURT_ORDER / ADMIN_ERROR) linked to its trigger, transitions affected lists to `UNDER_CORRECTION`, runs a recompute cascade (`JOB-PS06-CORRECTION-CASCADE` on X.1 — idempotent, resumable) that re-ranks seniority entries, re-snapshots QSL, re-evaluates downstream candidates/cases, posts an **SR correction event to PS12**, and raises a `PAY_ANOMALY_STEPPING_UP` signal to **PS10** where a junior would draw more than a senior (impr. #7). Correction approval is a **P01 maker-checker flow**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Any re-rank/recompute of a `FINALISED` list or `EFFECTED` order occurs only via a `correction_events` row (no silent edits) (impr. #6).
2. The correction records `reason_class`, its trigger (objection or legal case), affected entity, and a `recompute_scope_json`.
3. The cascade re-ranks affected `seniority_entries` (setting `superseded_by_correction`), supersedes affected QSL snapshots, and re-evaluates downstream candidates/cases; it runs in a transaction with `cascade_status` lifecycle (X.1 per-period run key).
4. Where the cascade causes a junior to draw more than a senior, `pay_anomaly_flag=true` and a stepping-up signal is sent to **PS10** (`pay_anomaly_signal_ref`) — PS06 detects and flags; PS10 computes the pay (impr. #7).
5. The correction is **P01 checker-approved** and posts an SR correction event (PS12); full lineage is auditable (P05) and replayable.

**Business Rules**
- Corrections are append-only lineage; originals are never destroyed.
- A court-ordered correction takes precedence and may be expedited; an admin-error correction requires recorded justification.
- The cascade is idempotent and resumable; a failed cascade rolls back to `ROLLED_BACK` and alerts (JOB-FAIL/MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL).

**UI Behavior Notes:** Correction wizard (reason → trigger → scope preview → impact summary listing affected ranks/orders/pay anomalies); cascade progress tracker; pay-anomaly list with PS10 signal status; lineage timeline.

**Edge Cases:** court orders retrospective promotion of one officer re-ranking a whole list and re-doing a downstream DPC; multiple corrections queued on one list (serialised); cascade failure mid-run (rollback + alert); stepping-up anomaly affecting many juniors.

### FR-PPP-019 — Refusal-of-Promotion Consequence Management (NEW — improvement #12)

- **Module:** PPP-ORD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker, P01)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, when an employee declines a promotion, I want the system to record the refusal and apply the policy consequences — a debarment window and a defined effect on the MACP clock — so that a refusal propagates a real consequence rather than just a reserve-list note.
- **Description:** On `promotion_orders.acceptance_status=DECLINED` (from FR-007), creates a `promotion_refusals` row with a configurable debarment window and an `macp_clock_effect`, bars re-consideration until `next_consideration_after`, and feeds the MACP engine (FR-011) so the clock effect is applied. Debarment-ending alert via `JOB-PS06-PROGRESSION` (X.1).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. A declined order creates a `promotion_refusals` row with `debarment_months`, computed `debarment_until`, and an `macp_clock_effect ∈ {NONE, STOP, FORFEIT_NEXT, RESET}` (impr. #12).
2. While `status=ACTIVE`, the employee is barred from re-consideration before `next_consideration_after`; FR-004 field assembly excludes them within the window.
3. The MACP engine (FR-011) applies the recorded clock effect (`refusal_effect_applied=true`).
4. Debarment expiry transitions the refusal to `EXPIRED` and raises a `REFUSAL_DEBARMENT_ENDING` alert beforehand (X.2).
5. A refusal may be `WAIVED` by authority with recorded justification (P01 checker action, audited).

**Business Rules**
- Debarment window and MACP-clock effect are policy configuration per grade/cadre (config cascade).
- Refusal does not by itself reduce seniority unless policy specifies.
- Waiver is a checker action, audited (P05).

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `promotion_refusals` | refusal + consequences |
| `promotion_orders` | source (DECLINED) |
| `financial_upgradations` | MACP-clock effect (FR-011) |
| `progression_alerts` | debarment-ending alert |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/orders/{id}/decline` | (FR-007) records decline → creates refusal |
| GET | `/api/v1/refusals?status=active` | List active refusals (cursor) |
| POST | `/api/v1/refusals/{id}/waive` | Waive debarment (P01 checker) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Refusal capture modal (reason, debarment preview, MACP-effect preview); active-refusals list with debarment countdown; waiver action with justification; refusal badge on employee progression timeline.

**Edge Cases:** employee declines then requests reconsideration within window (blocked unless waived); refusal forfeits next MACP up-gradation; multiple refusals across cycles (debarment compounding per policy).

### FR-PPP-020 — Multi-Stream Inter-se Seniority Construction (rota-quota) (NEW — improvement #4)

- **Module:** PPP-SEN
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment/Seniority Officer (maker), System Administrator (quota rules), Appointing Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As an Establishment Officer, I want to construct the combined inter-se seniority of direct recruits, promotees and LDCE qualifiers in a feeder grade using the applicable rota-quota / rotation-of-vacancies rule so that the most-litigated seniority dispute (N.R. Parmar line) is computed correctly and defensibly.
- **Description:** Defines `seniority_quota_rules` (DR:Promotee:LDCE ratios, rotation method, start slot, carry-forward of unfilled quota) and constructs the combined seniority by rotating vacancies across streams, assigning each entry a `quota_slot_label` and `rotation_cycle_no`; feeds FR-001 list generation when `is_multi_stream=true`. Pinned to a worked example (Appendix D.4).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. A quota rule records DR/promotee/LDCE ratios, `rotation_method`, `rotation_start_slot`, and `unfilled_quota_carry_forward`.
2. Combined construction interleaves streams per the rotation; each entry records its `quota_slot_label` and `rotation_cycle_no`.
3. Unfilled quota slots in a stream carry forward per the rule (no silent loss).
4. The construction is deterministic and matches the worked vector (Appendix D.4).
5. Stream/quota errors are objectionable as `STREAM_QUOTA_ERROR` (FR-002).

**Business Rules**
- Rotation method and ratios are version-effective-dated configuration (config cascade); the rule effective on `as_on_date` applies.
- `RUNNING_ACCOUNT` vs `ROTA_QUOTA` vs `SEPARATE_STREAM` methods are supported per policy (e.g., N.R. Parmar compliance).
- The data model must not preclude multi-stream even where the organisation currently runs single-stream feeder grades.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `seniority_quota_rules` | rotation configuration |
| `seniority_entries` | stream/quota slot assignment |
| `seniority_lists` | `is_multi_stream`, `quota_rule_id` |

| GET | `/api/v1/seniority-lists/{id}/rotation-trace` | Rotation slot trace |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Quota-rule editor (ratios, method, start slot) with worked-example preview; rotation-trace view showing which slot each entry consumed; stream colour legend on the combined list.

**Edge Cases:** quota slot exhausted in one stream (carry-forward); ratio change mid-cycle (rule snapshot); LDCE stream absent (degenerates to DR:Promotee); legacy data missing stream/quota history (flagged for manual stream tagging at P06 migration).

## Section 7 — UI Requirements

> Screens are **W.2 form definitions** and configured surfaces consuming `VAL-*` ids; approval surfaces use the **P01 approval action bar** (approve/reject/send-back/delegate). Every screen implements the **five canonical Foundation UI states** (empty / loading / error / no-permission / partial-data) per Foundation §3; masked fields render per **P02** field access. Surfaces route to the **Me / My Team / Admin** workspaces (Platform §6.5).

### 7.1 Screen inventory

### 7.2 Cross-cutting UI rules

- WCAG 2.1 AA (Platform §8.2): keyboard navigable grids, focus-visible, ARIA on status chips and countdowns; colour never the sole signal; responsive breakpoints 375/768/1280 px; touch targets ≥ 44×44 px.
- Dark mode supported via design tokens; no hardcoded colours.
- Every list uses **cursor pagination** (`limit` default 25, max 100, `next_cursor`), server-side sort/filter; empty/loading/error/no-permission/partial states explicit (no skeleton-only screens — real fields, data, API calls, states).
- **Field-level masking (P02):** APAR detail, disciplinary status and reservation category in the eligibility grid render only for field-authorised roles; others see a masked placeholder applied **on serialization** (impr. #16).
- Destructive/statutory actions (finalise, effect order, sanction MACP, revert probation, run correction cascade, de-reserve) require confirmation with a summary of side effects (SR posting, pay change, cascade impact) and route through **P01** where an approval is required.
- Sub-judice entities show a persistent banner and disable effecting actions.
- Dates display DD-MMM-YYYY; money INR formatted; times in user timezone; labels spell out acronyms; i18n per W.2.
- Row-level scoping (P02 five dimensions): users see only data within their org/cadre authorisation.

> Section numbering follows the 16-section authoring standard; API & Integration is consolidated in Section 9.

---

## Section 9 — API & Integration

### 9.1 Conventions (adopted verbatim from the platform — Foundation §1)

- Base path **`/api/v1`**; JSON; **JWT bearer** carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; **P02 `Authorization.check`** enforced server-side (endpoints never re-implement permission logic), incl. field-level masking on serialization.
- All list endpoints use **cursor pagination** (`?limit=` default **25**, max **100** + `cursor=` → **`next_cursor`**); `?sort=field:asc|desc`; resource-specific filters. **Offset/page paging is not used** (overrides the v2 `?page=&limit=`).
- **Idempotency:** workflow-initiating and SR-posting/order-effecting/correction-cascade/MACP-sanction POSTs accept an **`Idempotency-Key`** header (24h replay returns the original, not a duplicate); SR writes go to the canonical **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** and dedup on the PS12 tuple `(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id, source_event_version)` (§9.7.1).
- **`X-Correlation-Id`** on every request, echoed in the response header and written to every P05 audit/log line.
- Effective-dated mutations (`effective_from`) are **staged by `JOB-PS06-EFFDATE`** (X.1), not written live (Platform §3.3; `VAL-EFFECTIVE`).

### 9.2 Canonical error envelope (platform — Foundation §1; Reconciliation §C)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VACANCY_NOT_RECONCILED",
    "message": "Case vacancy (13) does not match sanctioned promotion-quota vacancies (12).",
    "field": "vacancy_count",
    "details": { "case_vacancy": 13, "sanctioned_promotion_quota": 12 }
  }
}
```

> The correlation id is carried in the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header**, **not** a body `requestId` field (override of the v2 envelope; Reconciliation §C).

### 9.3 Standard error-code table (platform 8-code — Foundation §1)

| Code | HTTP | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | **422** | input failed a `VAL-*` / `VAL-PS06-*` rule (replaces v2 `VALIDATION_ERROR(400)`) |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | no/invalid session (replaces v2 `AUTH_REQUIRED`) |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | authenticated but not permitted (never leaks existence of out-of-scope records) |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | resource absent or out of scope |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | idempotency replay, duplicate workflow start (`ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`), state conflict |
| `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | **412** | a required precondition not met (e.g., upstream PS08/PS09/PS10/PS12 unavailable, sub-judice block) — replaces the v2 `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE(503)`; upstream failures are mapped via X.3 to 412/500 + `ERR-LOADFAIL`, **no 503** |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | rate limit exceeded |
| `INTERNAL` | 500 | unexpected server error (replaces v2 `INTERNAL_ERROR`) |

Shared user-facing copy uses platform `ERR-*` ids (`ERR-FORBIDDEN`, `ERR-LOADFAIL`, `ERR-PRECOND`, `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`, `ERR-PAST-DATED`, `ERR-REASON-REQ`; Foundation §5).

### 9.4 PS06 module error-code catalog (domain 409/412 specialisations; v2 additions in **bold**)

> These are **domain specialisations carried in the `code` field** of the platform envelope; the HTTP status is the platform status (mostly **409 CONFLICT** or **412 PRECONDITION_FAILED**). The v2 standalone codes `VALIDATION_ERROR/AUTH_REQUIRED/INTERNAL_ERROR/UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` are removed in favour of the §9.3 table.

| PS06 code | HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SENIORITY_RANK_CONFLICT | 409 | Duplicate/gap rank on publish |
| OBJECTION_WINDOW_CLOSED | 409 | Objection filed outside window |
| OBJECTIONS_PENDING | 409 | Finalise blocked by open objections |
| SENIORITY_LIST_NOT_FINAL | 409 | Case needs a finalised list |
| NO_ELIGIBLE_CANDIDATES | 409 | Field empty |

| SEALED_COVER_NOT_REVIEWABLE | 409 | PS09 case not concluded |
| PROBATION_NOT_COMPLETE | 409 | Declare before period elapsed |
| PROBATION_EXTENSION_LIMIT | 409 | Extension over cap |
| OFFICIATING_OVERLAP | 409 | Conflicting arrangement |
| NO_REGULAR_SELECTION | 409 | Regularise without selection |
| MACP_CAP_REACHED | 409 | 3 financial up-gradations exhausted |
| POST_NOT_AVAILABLE | 409 | Destination post unavailable |
| SR_POSTING_FAILED | **412** | SR write to PS12 failed (held for retry) — was 503 |
| **VACANCY_NOT_RECONCILED** | 409 | Case vacancy ≠ sanctioned promotion-quota vacancies |
| **STRENGTH_INCONSISTENT** | 409 | filled_count > sanctioned_strength |
| **QUOTA_SPLIT_INVALID** | 409 | DR+promotion+LDCE quota > 100 |
| **APAR_NOT_USABLE** | 409 | Uncommunicated adverse APAR relied upon (Dev Dutt) |

| **CASCADE_FAILED** | 409 | Correction recompute cascade rolled back |

### 9.5 PS06 module-unique validation ids (`VAL-PS06-*`) — registered in Foundation §2 index

> PS06 cites platform `VAL-*` ids and authors only these module-unique rules (Foundation §7; `GAP (enterprise-specific)` per PLATFORM_FOUNDATION §7).

| Id | Applies to | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `VAL-PS06-QUALSVC` | qualifying_service_ledger | `net_qualifying_years = gross − Σ(excluded periods)`; non-negative; bounds per Appendix D.3 |
| `VAL-PS06-VACANCY-RECON` | promotion_cases.vacancy_count | Must equal the promotion-quota vacancies computed from the linked `sanctioned_posts` |
| `VAL-PS06-QUOTA-SPLIT` | sanctioned_posts | `dr_quota_pct + promotion_quota_pct + ldce_quota_pct ≤ 100`; `filled_count ≤ sanctioned_strength` |
| `VAL-PS06-SENIORITY` | seniority_entries | Contiguous 1..N ranks; deterministic tie-break order (Appendix D.4) |
| `VAL-PS06-ROSTER-OWNMERIT` | roster_points | Own-merit reserved candidate ⇒ UR point + `adjusted_against_category=GEN`; reserved point preserved |
| `VAL-PS06-APAR-USABLE` | eligibility_assessments | Adverse APAR usable only if `apar_communicated=true` and representation `DISPOSED`/`NA` (Dev Dutt) |
| `VAL-PS06-PANEL-CURRENCY` | promotion_panels | Orders blocked when `now > panel_valid_until` |
| `VAL-PS06-MACP-CAP` | financial_upgradations | `count(EFFECTED) ≤ 3`; promotions reduce remaining entitlement, not a combined cap |
| `VAL-PS06-SR-EVENT` | `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` write | SR append integrity; dedup on tuple `(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id, source_event_version)`; mandatory `fact_key` + `tenant_id`/`entity_id` (mirrors `VAL-PS12-SREVENT`; §9.7.1) |
| `VAL-PS06-SUBJUDICE` | order/list/posting effecting | Block effecting while an active `interim_stay` exists |

### 9.7 Integration contracts (re-grounded to PS-codes and platform mechanisms)

| Integration | Direction | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| **PS01** Employee + org/grade master | read + write-signal | Read person/job/designation/cadre/pay-scale (`VAL-GRADE-BAND`); signal designation/org_unit change on effect/join; filled-count reconciliation. **Reference, never fork.** |
| **PS03** Leave | read | EOL/leave facts for the qualifying-service ledger (FR-016) |
| **PS08** APAR (ex-M09 Performance) | read (by reference) | `GET /api/v1/ps08/apar?employeeId=&years=`: grading + benchmark band **+ communicated flag + representation status** per year (impr. #2). **Do not fork APAR.** |
| **PS09** Disciplinary/Vigilance | read + **event** | Status read; suspension facts for QSL; **subscribe to case-conclusion events** (via X.3) for sealed cover; degrade to scheduled reconcile `JOB-PS06-SEALED-RECONCILE` if only status read (impr. #19) |
| **PS10** Payroll | event + signal | Hand the pay event to PS10 on MACP/promotion effect; **emit stepping-up/pay-anomaly signal** on correction cascade; **PS10 is system-of-record for increments** (mirror only) (impr. #7, #18). **PS10 posts the pay SR event (`PAY_FIXATION`/`ANNUAL_INCREMENT`); PS06 does NOT** — PS06 references PS10 for it (no double-claim; §9.7.1) |
| **PS11** Pension | read | Anticipated-vacancy (superannuation) data for sanctioned-post computation |
| **PS12** Digital SR (on P05 substrate) | write (idempotent) | Append via canonical **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (reversals via `…/ingest/reversal`); dedup tuple `(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id, source_event_version)` + mandatory `fact_key` + explicit `tenant_id`/`entity_id`; PS06 event_type codes per §9.7.1; correction/reversal events use `is_reversal=true`+`reverses_source_reference_id` (`VAL-PS06-SR-EVENT`) |
| **PS13** Documents (ex-M11) | read/write | Upload/version orders, minutes, lists, quantifiable-data records, court orders, exam results (retention classes; `VAL-M11-RETENTION`) |
| **PS05** Transfer | create/sync | Create relieving/joining movement (configured P01 flow) for out-station postings |
| **PS07** Training | read | Competency references for career-path stages (advisory; read-only) |
| **P01** WorkflowEngine | invoke | `startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel` for publication, DPC (PARALLEL_ALL_OF + DYNAMIC_APPROVER), order issue, MACP sanction, de-reservation, correction approval |
| **P02** Authorization | invoke | `Authorization.check` on every endpoint; field masks on serialization |
| **P05** Audit | auto | DB-trigger capture on every PS06 table mutation; `Audit.query/export` for Auditor |
| **X.1** Jobs | register | `JOB-PS06-*` registered against the runner (Foundation §4 index) |
| **X.2** Notifications | write | Alerts, invitations, acknowledgements, sealed-cover review reminders, stay notifications (`MSG-PS06-*`); statutory notices mandatory/non-suppressible (BRD §9.9) |
| **P06** Migration | invoke | Legacy seniority/service-book/roster/MACP/officiating migration via ETL+V (3 dry runs, waves, `<enterprise>_source_id`) |

#### 9.7.1 Canonical SR ingestion contract (PS12 is the single source of truth)

PS12 froze the SR ingestion contract; PS06 conforms to it (no module-local divergence).

- **Write-port.** The single ledger write-path is **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (and **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal`** for corrections/cancellations). A PS06-local `SrPostingGateway` / `…/post-to-sr` is permitted only as an internal façade that **relays to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`**. PS06 never calls `/api/v1/sr/events` and never INSERTs into `service_register_events` directly.
- **PS06 event_type codes (verbatim, as published by PS12).** PS06 emits **only** these codes — replace any free-form event name with the exact code:

  | Domain action | PS12 `event_type` code | Reversal/partner code |
  |---|---|---|
  | Regular/ad-hoc/in-situ/LDCE promotion effected | `PROMOTION` | `PROMOTION_CANCELLED` |
  | Officiating / ad-hoc upward arrangement (start/end) | `OFFICIATING` | `OFFICIATING_CANCELLED` |
  | Reversion (probation reversion / supersession) | `REVERSION` | — |
  | MACP / ACP financial up-gradation sanctioned | `MACP` | (reverse via `is_reversal=true`) |
  | Probation satisfactory declaration / confirmation | `CONFIRMATION` | (reverse via `is_reversal=true`) |
  | Posting after promotion (joining) | `POSTING` | (reverse via `is_reversal=true`) |

  `POSTING` is a PS06-owned event. PS06 does **not** emit any `TRANSFER`/`RELIEVING`/`JOINING` family code (those are PS05's), nor any pay/increment code.
- **Ingest payload contract (every call).** Populate the dedup tuple **`(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id, source_event_version)`** with `source_module` set **explicitly** to `"PS06"` (never inferred); `source_reference_id` is the PS06 business key of the originating row (e.g., `promotion_orders.order_id`, `officiating_arrangements.id`, `financial_upgradations.id`, `promotion_postings.id`, `correction_events.id`). Every call also carries an explicit **`fact_key`** (qualifying-service-bearing — **required**; derived per the event type's `fact_correlation_rule`, PS12 FR-01; missing → `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED`) and explicit **`tenant_id`** + **`entity_id`** (PS12 hashes `tenant_id`+`employee_id` into `entry_hash`). The HTTP `Idempotency-Key` header may be a writer-local hash, but the **persisted dedup tuple above is the contract**.
- **Pay-fixation boundary (no double-claim).** PS06 posts the **establishment** event only (`PROMOTION`/`OFFICIATING`/`MACP`/`CONFIRMATION`/`POSTING`/`REVERSION`). The **pay** SR event is **PS10's** — `PAY_FIXATION` on MACP/promotion effect and `ANNUAL_INCREMENT` for increments. PS06 hands the pay event to PS10 and **references PS10 for the pay SR posting; it does NOT itself post `PAY_FIXATION`/`ANNUAL_INCREMENT`.**
- **Reversal/correction envelope.** Corrections, reversions and cancellations use the PS12 envelope **`is_reversal=true`** + **`reverses_source_reference_id`** (pointing at the original `source_reference_id`) and, where a published partner type exists, the `*_CANCELLED` code (`PROMOTION_CANCELLED`, `OFFICIATING_CANCELLED`). PS12 auto-spawns the corrigendum; entries are supersede-only (never deleted/edited; P05 immutability).

## Section 10 — Non-Functional Requirements

### 10.1 NFR table (adopts the platform NFR baseline — Platform §8.2; Reconciliation §C)

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Performance | **Platform baseline: standard API p95 < 500ms @ 300 concurrent; read-heavy p95 < 300ms cached / < 1000ms uncached; writes p95 < 1500ms.** Module batch: eligibility batch compute of 5,000 employees < 5 min (async with progress); seniority list (10k entries) generation < 60s; correction cascade on a 10k-entry list < 5 min (async, resumable, X.1) |
| Scalability | Horizontal stateless API; batch jobs partitioned by cadre/org for parallelism; per-tenant job isolation (X.1) |
| Availability | **99.5%/month uptime** (platform baseline, overrides v2 99.9%); SR-posting retries with backoff (X.2/X.3); degraded read mode if PS08/PS09 down; sealed-cover reconcile fallback (`JOB-PS06-SEALED-RECONCILE`) if PS09 event bus down |
| Consistency | Statutory writes (order effect, MACP sanction, select-list approval, refusal processing, correction cascade) are ACID transactions; SR posting idempotent (PS12); QSL snapshots immutable; P01 idempotent stage-advance |
| Security | OWASP ASVS; TLS 1.2+; **P02** RBAC + five-dimension row-level scoping; **field-level masking** on eligibility PII (on serialization); sealed-cover data restricted; parameterised queries only; secrets via env / `integration_credentials` (P04); MFA for high-privilege roles |
| Privacy | DPDP Act 2023 alignment; PII minimisation in comparative views; reservation category masked from unauthorised roles (P02); **module DPIA for the eligibility snapshot (§10.2)**; `consent_records` + right-to-erasure for non-statutory data only (statutory retention floors apply) |
| Auditability | **P05 dual-log, DB-trigger, 100% mutation capture, immutable, ≥7-yr**; statutory artefacts immutable & versioned; correction lineage append-only; full reconstruction of any promotion decision incl. the cited QSL snapshot and APAR-usability decision; reading an audit log is itself audited; tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** (hash-chaining) |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA across all screens; 375/768/1280 breakpoints; touch ≥ 44×44 px |
| Observability | Structured logs with **`X-Correlation-Id`**; metrics on batch durations, SR-posting success rate, alert/cascade counts, pay-anomaly signals (Platform §0.5); job run audit rows (X.1); alerting on SR-post failure backlog and failed cascades (JOB-FAIL → MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL) |
| Retention | Seniority lists, DPC minutes, orders, correction events retained per statutory schedule (typically permanent for service-record-linked artefacts) — never below the statutory floor; **APAR snapshot (`apar_detail_json`) retained only until `apar_snapshot_retention_until`** then purged/anonymised by `JOB-PS06-APAR-PURGE` (impr. #16) |
| Recovery | **RTO < 4h, RPO < 1h** (platform baseline; overrides v2 RPO ≤ 15min) |
| Localisation | DD-MMM-YYYY, INR, timezone-aware; i18n-ready labels (W.2) with acronyms spelled out |
| Deletions | **Soft delete only** — no hard delete platform-wide (Platform §8.2) |

### 10.2 DPIA note — eligibility snapshot (improvement #16)

The `eligibility_assessments` row (with `apar_detail_json`, `disciplinary_status`, `reservation_category`, `obc_creamy_layer_status`) is the **single most sensitive PII concentration** in the suite. Controls, grounded on the platform:

- **Purpose limitation:** the APAR/disciplinary/category fields may be read only for eligibility adjudication and audit; never for general HR browsing.
- **Field-level access control via P02:** only DPC members, the adjudicating HR Officer, Vigilance Officer (disciplinary) and Auditor can decrypt the APAR snapshot; all other roles see masked values **applied on serialization** (an over-broad query cannot leak the field). Bound by the **PII Protection Ceiling** which overrides every role upward (Platform §P02; RBAC §6.3).
- **Explicit retention:** `apar_snapshot_retention_until` bounds the APAR snapshot lifetime; `JOB-PS06-APAR-PURGE` (X.1) purges/anonymises expired snapshots while preserving the immutable decision outcome and trace (not the raw grades).
- **Minimisation:** comparative grids show pass/fail chips, not raw grades, unless field-authorised.
- **Auditability:** every read of the APAR snapshot is logged by **P05** with correlation id and role (reading an audit/PII field is itself audited).

## Section 11 — Workflow & State Diagrams (State Tables)

> Statutory approval transitions (publish, select-list approve, order issue, MACP sanction, de-reserve, correction approve) are **P01 workflow stage transitions**; "checker" = a P01 approver stage (`DYNAMIC_APPROVER`/named role). Each transition writes one `workflow_actions` row + a P05 audit row. Side-effect "SR" = append to the **PS12** ledger; "pay-anomaly signal" = to **PS10**.

## Section 13 — Reporting & Analytics

| Report | Description | Primary consumer |
|---|---|---|
| Establishment & vacancy report | Sanctioned/filled/vacant per grade/office, quota split, computed vacancies | Establishment, HR leadership |
| Seniority register (cadre-wise, multi-stream) | Current finalised seniority per cadre/grade with stream/quota | Establishment, Auditor |
| DPC proceedings & select-list report | Per-case minutes, verdicts, select/reserve/sealed lists, panel currency | Appointing authority, Auditor |
| Roster compliance report (with own-merit migrations) | Points filled vs. due by category, own-merit migrations, carry-forward, de-reservation, enabling justification | Roster officer, Auditor |
| Qualifying-service ledger extract | Net qualifying service + exclusion breakdown per employee/grade | HR, Auditor |
| Promotion throughput | Vacancies vs. filled vs. cycle time | HR leadership, PS14 |
| Stagnation report | Employees beyond grade-tenure threshold (from QSL) without progression | HR, Dept head |
| MACP due & granted | Upcoming/granted up-gradations, cap usage (n/3), deferrals, refusal effects | HR, Payroll (PS10) |
| Refusal & debarment register | Active/expired/waived refusals and MACP-clock effects | HR, Auditor |
| Due-for-promotion projection | Eligible cohorts by grade/cycle | HR, leadership |
| Succession readiness (advisory) | Critical positions, bench strength, risk | Leadership |
| Litigation-risk register | Sub-judice cases/orders/lists, interim stays, subject-to-outcome orders, supersessions, objections upheld, sealed covers pending | Legal/HR |
| Correction-lineage & pay-anomaly report | Correction events, re-ranks, stepping-up signals to PS10 | Establishment, Payroll, Auditor |
| Audit trail extract | All state changes for a case/employee (via **P05 `Audit.query/export`**) | Auditor |

Module reports expose data to **PS14** (enterprise analytics, ex-M16) via read APIs/materialised views; all reports respect **P02** org/cadre scoping and field-level access, and are exportable (PDF/CSV) with **P05** audit of export (`analytics.*` entitlement; Org Admin = cross-entity).

## Section 14 — Migration & Launch (on P06 ETL+V — Platform §P06)

> All legacy migration runs on the **P06 Migration Toolkit**: **Extract → Validate → Transform → Load → Verify**, scripted idempotently, **three mandatory staging dry runs**, waves, `migration_runs` ledger, and a permanent **`<enterprise>_source_id`** traceability/dedup column on every migrated table (the enterprise source register replaces `darwinbox_source_id`; `GAP (enterprise-specific)`). Failed records logged with source row + violated rule.

### 14.1 Data migration

| Step | Source | Target | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sanctioned strength | Establishment sanction orders | `sanctioned_posts` | filled ≤ sanctioned; quota sum ≤ 100; reconcile filled with PS01 |
| Service-fact baseline | Service books / PS01/PS03/PS09 | `qualifying_service_ledger` (initial snapshots) | net = gross − exclusions; exclusion breakdown reproducible (`VAL-PS06-QUALSVC`) |
| Legacy seniority lists (multi-stream) | Existing registers/spreadsheets | `seniority_lists`/`seniority_entries` | rank contiguity; **stream tag present** (flag `STREAM_TAG_MISSING` for manual tagging); employee match by `service_no` |
| Quota/rotation history | Office orders | `seniority_quota_rules` + entry slot labels | ratios consistent; rotation reproducible |
| Past promotions | Service books / legacy HRMS | `promotion_orders` (EFFECTED, historical) | designation transitions valid; SR backfill to PS12 (`historical=true`) |
| Existing MACP grants | Pay records | `financial_upgradations` (EFFECTED) | **count ≤ 3 financial up-gradations**; scheme/level mapping |
| Active officiating | Office orders | `officiating_arrangements` (ACTIVE) | no overlaps; sanctioned post linked |
| Reservation rosters | Roster registers | `reservation_rosters`/`roster_points` | cycle integrity; **own-merit migrations reconciled**; enabling justification attached (PS13) |
| Pending litigation | Legal registers | `legal_case_links` | active stays flagged; sub-judice entities set INTERIM_STAYED |
| Ongoing probations | Service records | `probation_records` | end-date arithmetic |

- Migration runs through the P06 staging environment; reconciliation report must show **0 unmatched mandatory records and 0 unresolved own-merit/stream-tag flags** before cutover (P06 three dry runs gate).
- Historical SR backfill posts idempotently to **PS12** with a `historical=true` flag (on the P05 substrate).

### 14.2 Configuration before launch (via P04/W.1/W.2/W.3 config cascade)

- Sanctioned strength + quota split per grade/office; vacancy-computation parameters.
- Service-exclusion rules (EOL/dies-non/suspension/ad-hoc/deputation) with worked examples (Appendix D.3).
- Seniority quota/rotation rules per multi-stream grade (Appendix D.4).
- Eligibility rules per grade pair (incl. APAR-communication, cert-currency, LDCE exam flags); zone slabs (Appendix D.1); benchmark thresholds.
- Reservation policy parameters; roster cycle sizes; enabling-provision references; consequential-seniority mode (Appendix D.2).
- Panel currency duration; probation periods; MACP qualifying-year schedule and cap (3); refusal debarment + MACP-clock effects.
- **P01 flow definitions (W.1)** for DPC, order issue, MACP sanction, correction approval, de-reservation; **W.2 forms** for objection intake, roster fill, refusal capture; **W.3** notification config; **X.1** `JOB-PS06-*` registration.
- Alert lead times and stagnation thresholds; career-path templates (advisory).
- **RBAC v1.7** registration of new PS06 roles + capability flags (RBAC §4.3/§2.2); MFA for high-privilege roles.

### 14.3 Launch strategy

- **Phase 0:** Establishment-strength register (FR-015) + qualifying-service ledger (FR-016) seeded and reconciled (P06) — prerequisite to all kernels; `JOB-PS06-*` registered on X.1.
- **Phase 1:** Multi-stream seniority + eligibility (read-only verification with HR); P01 publication flow live.
- **Phase 2:** Promotion case → DPC (P01 committee-as-workflow, panel currency) → orders (refusal, subject-to-litigation) + SR posting to PS12 (pilot cadre).
- **Phase 3:** MACP (corrected cap), officiating, posting integration with PS05/PS10; legal-case linkage + correction cascade (X.1).
- **Phase 4:** Progression monitoring (increment mirror from PS10), career-path/succession (advisory), PS14 dashboards.
- Each phase gated by reconciliation against legacy and SR posting verification.

### 14.4 Rollback & cutover

- Feature-flagged module (per-tenant); legacy registers retained read-only ≥ 4 weeks during parallel run (P06).
- Rollback plan: disable write endpoints, retain data, revert to legacy for in-flight cases; **no SR events deleted** (corrections only via FR-018; P05 immutability).

### 16.3 Appendix B — Assumptions & open items

| Item | Assumption | Owner/Date to confirm |
|---|---|---|
| APAR read API shape | **PS08** provides per-year grading + benchmark band **+ communicated flag + representation status** (impr. #2); consumed by reference | PS08 team |
| Disciplinary event stream | **PS09** emits case-conclusion **events** (via X.3); degrade to nightly status reconcile (`JOB-PS06-SEALED-RECONCILE`) if only status read (impr. #19) | PS09 team |
| Sealed-cover dependency | Confirmed as **event-driven** with poll fallback; periodic-review SLA enforced regardless | PS09 team |

| SR idempotency key | `source_module=PS06 + source_reference_id` accepted by **PS12** on the P05 substrate; correction events post SR corrections | PS12 team |
| Legacy stream/quota history | May be incomplete; P06 migration flags `STREAM_TAG_MISSING` for manual tagging | Establishment authority |
| Audit tamper-evidence | Tracks platform **OPEN-PLAT-03** (hash-chaining of audit_log partitions to WORM) rather than a parallel mechanism | Security / Architecture |
| New RBAC roles/flags | New PS06 roles (`ps06_dpc_member`, `ps06_appointing_authority`, `ps06_reviewing_authority`, etc.) registered in RBAC §4.3/§2.2 via the working-group process | RBAC working group |

### 16.4 Appendix C — Standards referenced

- **`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`** (Master BRD v2.1 · Product Vision v2.6 · Platform Spec v1.6 · RBAC Design v1.7 · Foundation FS v1.6) and **`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md`** — the authoritative grounding artefacts (supersede the invented `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`).
- OWASP ASVS; WCAG 2.1 AA; India DPDP Act 2023 (with module DPIA §10.2).
- Public-sector DPC/seniority/reservation/MACP procedural conventions (parameterised, not hard-coded; config cascade).
- Jurisprudence reflected as controls (not hard-coded): `Dev Dutt` (APAR communication), `M. Nagaraj`/`Jarnail Singh` (reservation-in-promotion enabling data), `N.R. Parmar` (inter-se seniority of DR/promotees).

### 16.5 Appendix D — Pinned Kernel Algorithms & Worked Test Vectors (improvement #10)

The four litigation-bearing kernels are pinned here with inputs, formula and worked numeric vectors. These are the **test vectors** to ship before kernel code.

#### D.1 Zone of consideration (non-linear DoPT slab)

- **Inputs:** `vacancy_count` (from sanctioned_posts promotion quota); `slab` config; reserved-category extended-zone factor.
- **Formula (configurable, default slab):** `zone = 5 if v=1; 8 if v=2; 3×v if v≥3`. Reserved-category extended zone adds the policy factor where roster requires; ties at the boundary are included.
- **Worked vector:** v=1 → 5; v=2 → 8; v=5 → 15; v=12 → 36 candidates considered. For v=12 with a reserved extended-zone factor of +50% on SC/ST sub-field, the SC/ST consideration field extends to 18 while the general field stays 36. Boundary tie at rank 36–37 (equal seniority) → both included (field = 37).

#### D.2 Reservation-roster mathematics (with own-merit migration)

- **Inputs:** `cycle_size` (e.g., 100); reservation %s (e.g., SC 15, ST 7.5, OBC 27, EWS 10, PwBD 4 horizontal); selected candidates with category + `selected_on_own_merit`; carry-forward; de-reservation limit; 50% ceiling.
- **Rules:** own-merit reserved candidate occupies a UR point (`adjusted_against_category=GEN`), reserved point preserved; reserved points unfilled → carry-forward; de-reservation only after carry-forward limit; vertical reservation ≤ 50% (EWS additional per policy); PwBD interpolated horizontally.
- **Worked vector (100-point cycle, 12 vacancies):** Roster points due in this cycle: SC at points {7,15,...}, OBC at {8,...}. Suppose selected = 8 GEN, 2 SC, 2 OBC; one OBC (emp-1110) tops the general merit list. **Without migration (WRONG):** OBC point consumed → reservation over-counted. **With migration (CORRECT):** emp-1110 placed on a UR point with `adjusted_against_category=GEN`; the OBC roster point at #8 remains `CARRIED_FORWARD`/preserved; category tally = GEN 9 (8+1 own-merit), SC 2, OBC 1 against-roster + 1 own-merit-migrated. Compliance report itemises 1 own-merit migration; reserved tally unchanged by the migrated candidate.

#### D.3 Qualifying-service exclusions

- **Inputs:** entry-into-grade date; `as_of_date` (crucial date); leave/EOL periods (**PS03**); suspension periods + outcome (**PS09**); ad-hoc vs regular segments; deputation periods; `service_exclusion_rules`.
- **Formula:** `net = gross − Σ(excluded periods)`; EOL beyond `eol_max_condonable_days` excluded; dies-non fully excluded; suspension per `suspension_treatment`; ad-hoc counts only if `adhoc_counts_if_regularised` and regularised; deputation counts per flag.
- **Worked vector:** entry 2015-09-01, as-of 2026-01-01 → gross = 10.337 yrs (3775 days). Deduct: EOL 120 days (condonable limit 90 → 30 excess days excluded), dies-non 10 days, suspension 60 days (treatment EXCLUDE; later exoneration would trigger a correction recompute adding them back). Total exclusion = 30 + 10 + 60 = 100 days. **net = 3775 − 100 = 3675 days = 10.062 yrs.** If the eligibility rule requires 10.0 net years → ELIGIBLE; the snapshot stores the itemised breakdown and is cited by FR-003/011.

#### D.4 Multi-stream inter-se seniority (rota-quota)

- **Inputs:** stream-internal seniority lists (DR, Promotee, LDCE); `seniority_quota_rules` (ratio, method, start slot, carry-forward).
- **Formula (ROTA_QUOTA, ratio DR:Promotee = 1:1, start DR_FIRST):** rotate vacancy slots DR, PR, DR, PR, …; each slot draws the next senior-most from that stream; unfilled stream slot carries forward.
- **Worked vector:** DR list = [D1, D2, D3]; PR list = [P1, P2, P3]; ratio 1:1, start DR_FIRST. Combined rank order = D1(rank1, slot DR-1), P1(rank2, slot PR-1), D2(rank3, slot DR-2), P2(rank4, slot PR-2), D3(rank5, slot DR-3), P3(rank6, slot PR-3). If PR has only [P1] available at cycle 2, slot PR-2 carries forward and D3 takes rank4 (slot DR-3); PR-2 is filled later when P2 joins, re-rank handled via a correction event (FR-018) if the list was already finalised. Running-account method differs: quota deficiencies are reconciled across cycles rather than slot-by-slot — selectable via `rotation_method`.

## Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform

This section maps each FR (and cross-cutting concern) to the **platform service(s)** it runs on, and names any **`GAP (enterprise-specific)`** statutory engine PS06 authors (which still runs on the named platform engines). Authority: `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §5–§9; `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A/§C/§D.

### `GAP (enterprise-specific)` statutory engines PS06 authors (each runs on platform engines)

1. **Qualifying-Service Ledger + exclusion engine** (FR-016) — net-new; runs on P05 (audit), P06 (legacy migration); consumes PS01/PS03/PS09.
2. **Seniority/promotion case engine** (FR-001/002/004/005/020) — net-new; DPC adjudication runs on **P01** (committee-as-workflow); audit on P05.
3. **Reservation roster + own-merit migration** (FR-006) — net-new; approvals on P01; audit on P05.
4. **Sanctioned-post / establishment register** (FR-015) — net-new; maker-checker on P01.
5. **Legal-case linkage / sub-judice guard + correction-lineage cascade** (FR-017/018) — net-new; approval on P01, cascade on X.1, pay-anomaly to PS10, SR correction to PS12.
6. **MACP cap/clock + refusal consequence** (FR-011/019) — net-new; screening/sanction on P01, due-detection on X.1, pay event to PS10.

These are exactly the **PS06 net-new entities** registered in `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §D (`seniority_list`, `promotion_case`, `dpc_proceedings`, `posting_history`, plus the v2-expanded set), all **running on P01 (sanction) + P05 (audit)** and **emitting SR events to PS12**.

## Amendments (v2 → v3: platform re-grounding)

Every change from v2.0 (`M06-PPP`) to v3.0 (`PS06`) is a **platform re-grounding** — no statutory capability, entity, field, rule, state, or worked example was removed; the technical substrate was re-anchored onto PrimeSoft. (The v1→v2 statutory improvements remain in §1.7.)

| # | v2 (invented `SHARED_FOUNDATION`) | v3 (platform-grounded) | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Module code `M06-PPP`; cross-refs `M01/M03/M05/M07/M08/M09/M10/M11/M12/M13/M14` | **PS06**; cross-refs re-keyed to **PS01/PS03/PS05/PS07/PS08/PS09/PS10/PS11/PS12/PS13/PS14** | Reconciliation §B |

| A9 | Pagination "max page size 100", `?page=&limit=` | **Cursor pagination only**: `?limit=` default 25 / max 100 + `cursor=` → `next_cursor`; offset paging removed | Foundation §1; Reconciliation §C |
| A10 | Idempotency unspecified | **`Idempotency-Key`** header on workflow-initiating / SR / order-effect / MACP-sanction / cascade POSTs (24h replay) | Foundation §1 |
| A11 | Multi-tenancy omitted | **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`** non-nullable on every entity; **data-layer scoping**; unscoped query rejected | Platform §0.1; Reconciliation §C |

## Amendments (v3 → v3.1: cross-module remediation)

Surgical convergence onto the **PS12-frozen SR ingestion contract** per the authoritative remediation spec (`docs/review/REMEDIATION.md` D1/D2; R1 findings F-02/F-03/F-07). No statutory capability, entity, field, rule, state, or worked example was removed.

| # | v3.0 | v3.1 (remediated) | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | SR posting described generically ("post to PS12"); write-path implied via `SrPostingGateway` | **Canonical write-port `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (reversals `…/ingest/reversal`) is the only ledger write-path; any `…/post-to-sr` façade **relays to it**; never `/api/v1/sr/events` or direct INSERT (§2.2, §9.7.1, FR-007 API) | REMEDIATION D1 |
| R2 | Free-form event descriptions (promotion/officiating/confirmation/posting) | **Exact PS12-published `event_type` codes pinned** in §9.7.1: `PROMOTION`, `OFFICIATING`, `MACP`, `CONFIRMATION`, `POSTING`, `REVERSION` (+ partners `PROMOTION_CANCELLED`, `OFFICIATING_CANCELLED`); `POSTING` is a PS06 event | REMEDIATION D1; F-03 |
| R3 | Dedup key `source_module=PS06`+`source_event_id`; no `fact_key`; tenant/entity implicit | **Renamed `source_event_id` → `source_reference_id`**; dedup is the tuple `(source_module="PS06", source_reference_id, source_event_version)` with explicit `source_module`; **mandatory `fact_key`** (qualifying-service-bearing; missing → `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED`); explicit `tenant_id`+`entity_id` (§2.2, §2.4, §9.5 `VAL-PS06-SR-EVENT`, §9.6, §9.7/§9.7.1, §13.x idempotency) | REMEDIATION D1; F-02 |
| R4 | Pay-fixation hand-off to PS10 stated, but SR ownership of the pay event ambiguous | **No double-claim:** PS06 posts the **establishment** event only; the **pay SR event is PS10's** (`PAY_FIXATION` / `ANNUAL_INCREMENT`). PS06 references PS10 for the pay event and does NOT post it (§9.7.1, §9.7 PS10 row, FR-007 AC#4, §9.6 example) | REMEDIATION D2; F-07 |
| R5 | Corrections posted "SR correction" without a named envelope | **Reversal envelope** `is_reversal=true` + `reverses_source_reference_id` (+ `*_CANCELLED` partner types); supersede-only; PS12 auto-spawns corrigendum (§9.7.1, §9.6 cascade example) | REMEDIATION D1 |

---

*End of PS06 Promotion, Posting & Progression Monitoring BRD v3.0 — platform-grounded. Preserves all v2.0 statutory content and rigor; re-anchored onto the PrimeSoft platform (P01–P06, X.1–X.3, W.1–W.3) with 0 unresolved reconciliation gaps.*
