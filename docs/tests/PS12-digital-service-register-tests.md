# PS12 — Digital Service Register — Acceptance & E2E Test Suite

## 1. Header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | **PS12 — Digital Employee Service Register (Digital SR)** — statutory system-of-record; owner of the SR ingestion write-port and the append-only, hash-chained SR ledger (`service_register_events`). |
| Version tested | BRD v3.0 / v3.1 (platform-grounded); OpenAPI `PS12.yaml` v3.1.0. |
| Scope | Contract + integrity guarantees of the write-port `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` (+ `/ingest/reversal`); append-only immutability & hash-chain/status-chain/anchor integrity; corrigendum/annotation/appeal maker-checker with second-custodian SoD; attestation; periodic verification (bulk/assisted/heir) & gap-register completeness; certified extracts + §65B; offline/QR verification; LTV renewal; legacy digitisation; access log; subscriptions; retention & cross-tenant chain continuity. FR-01…FR-21. |
| Out of scope | Originating business processes owned by writer modules (leave approval PS03, transfer PS05, promotion PS06, disciplinary PS09, payroll PS10, pension computation PS11); document byte storage (PS13); dashboards (PS14). PS12 records the statutory fact only. |
| Traceability | Every TC cites `Traces-to` (FR + AC/BR). Error codes/HTTP asserted verbatim from `docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.yaml` (PS12 `SR_*` / `ERR-PS12-*`) and `PS12.yaml`. State transitions per `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml` (PS12). Authorization per `docs/contracts/auth-matrix.yaml` (PS12 actions + SoD). |
| Grounding docs | `docs/brd/v3/PS12-digital-service-register.md`; `docs/contracts/openapi/PS12.yaml`; `docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.yaml`; `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml`; `docs/contracts/auth-matrix.yaml`. |

### 1.1 Test environment & data assumptions

- **Multi-tenant (P04):** two provisioned tenants `T-ALPHA`, `T-BETA`. Every SR entity carries `tenant_id`; the per-employee chain is scoped to `(tenant_id, employee_id)`. Cross-tenant content operations are reserved to Platform Super Admin tooling.
- **Platform conventions:** base path `/api/v1`; global `bearerAuth`; every response echoes `X-Correlation-Id`; unsafe POSTs carry `Idempotency-Key` (24h replay → original result); cursor pagination (`limit` default 25 / max 100). Canonical error envelope `{ error: { code, message, field, details } }`, correlation id in the header (never a body field).
- **Personas / principals:**
  - `SP-PS0x` — source-module **service principals** (mutual-TLS + service JWT) with scope `sr.ingest.write` only, one per writer module **PS01, PS04, PS05, PS06, PS08, PS09, PS10, PS11**. Cannot read others' SR or issue extracts.
  - `SP-PS03` — a non-writer service principal (PS03) used for allowlist negative tests.
  - `CUST-1`, `CUST-2` — SR Custodians (`sr_custodian`, entity-scoped, `ps12_sr_custodian` flag). `CUST-2` acts as the distinct **Second Custodian** (`sr_second_custodian`).
  - `HRO-1` — HR Officer (`hr_admin`) — assisted verification, legacy-batch maker.
  - `EMP-100245` — employee (self-scope); `HEIR-1` — identity-verified nominee/heir for a DEATH_IN_SERVICE case.
  - `APP-1` — Appellate Authority (`appellate_authority`, read+decision only).
  - `PENS-1` — Pension Officer (`pension_officer`, read-only full).
  - `AUD-1` — Auditor (Org-Admin read + P05 query; read-only; may trigger integrity/anchor verify).
  - `SYS-1` — System Administrator (`org_admin`) — taxonomy drafts, CA/HSM/TSA/anchor/LTV config; no ledger authoring/attestation.
- **The 8 writer modules as callers** post through `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` citing the exact published `event_type_code` strings from the FR-01.A catalog and the `fact_correlation_rule`-derived `fact_key`.
- **Seed data:** the FR-01.A canonical `sr_event_type` catalog is PUBLISHED (all 18 categories); `sr_expected_event_rule` set (e.g. `ANNUAL_INCREMENT` cadence) is seeded; at least one anchor (`sr_anchors`) exists within cadence; CA/HSM/RFC 3161 TSA/WORM confirmed available.
- **Golden employees:** `EMP-100245` (service_no `PS-100245`) with a pre-seeded chain (APPOINTMENT→…→PROMOTION seq 42, SUPERSEDED→PROMOTION_CORRIGENDUM seq 43 ACTIVE) in `T-ALPHA`.
