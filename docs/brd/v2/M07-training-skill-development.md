## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Training and Skill Development Management module (M07-TSD) is the enterprise system that closes the loop between **what the workforce can do today** and **what each role demands**. It establishes a governed **competency and skill framework**, maintains a per-employee **skill inventory** with **freshness/decay controls**, computes **incremental skill-gap analysis**, converts gaps into a governed **annual training plan and calendar**, manages the full **training delivery lifecycle** (course catalog, nomination, scheduling, attendance, assessment, Kirkpatrick evaluation, certification), runs **mandatory-compliance campaigns at workforce scale**, tracks induction training, governs the **training budget**, captures **externally-acquired professional credentials**, manages **vendor empanelment and sponsorship/service-bond obligations**, and posts significant trainings and qualifications to the statutory **Digital Service Register (M12-SR)**.

### 1.2 Business context
For a public-sector employer, training is not only a capability lever but a **statutory and audit obligation**: mandatory compliance training (e.g., conduct rules, cyber-security, POSH, ethics), induction for new entrants, and the recording of significant qualifications/trainings in the service register are legally consequential. M07-TSD therefore combines **world-class HCM learning capabilities** (learning paths, skills marketplace, micro-learning, LMS/LRS/SCORM/xAPI integration, AI skill recommendations, CPD credit tracking) with **public-sector rigour** (maker-checker nominations, budget sanction, segregation of duties, immutable audit, statutory SR posting).

The v2 revision **separates the statutory spine from the developmental layer** (council First-Principles finding). The statutory spine — mandatory-compliance campaigns, certification, induction, and SR posting — is launch-required, high-volume, and proven end-to-end on a pilot department first. The developmental layer — weighted competency scoring, AI recommendations, and the skills marketplace — is feature-flagged Phase 2, gated on **evidence of framework curation**, so sophistication is built on the axis only after it is fed real data.

### 1.3 Key outcomes
- A single competency taxonomy and role-based competency models, **with review cadence and ownership**, drive objective skill-gap measurement.
- Skill inventory carries **freshness**: stale, never-revalidated skills are discounted from gap closure so the gap engine's inputs do not silently rot.
- Training needs originate from three reconciled sources: competency gaps, **appraisal development gaps imported from M08-PAM** via a versioned contract, and statutory mandates.
- Mandatory annual training for the entire workforce is orchestrated by a **campaign engine** (bulk nominate → auto-wave into capacity-bounded sessions → rolling renewal → escalation), reachable even by **non-login field staff** via proxy/kiosk/offline capture.
- Every nomination, attendance mark, assessment, certificate, credential, and cost entry is auditable and traceable to a need.
- Significant trainings/qualifications post automatically to the Digital SR (M12) as append-only events using a **pinned event contract**.

### 1.4 Scope summary
M07-TSD owns competency/skill master data, the skill inventory, training programs and sessions, content/assessment-item assets, nominations, campaigns, attendance, assessment, feedback, certification, external credentials, learning paths, CPD records, the training budget, vendor empanelment, sponsorship/service-bond records, and LMS/LRS-integration metadata. It consumes employee master data (M01), appraisal gaps (M08), org structure, documents (M13), and notifications, and it writes events to the Digital SR (M12) and analytics to M14.

### 1.5 Success metrics (KPIs)
| KPI | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Mandatory-compliance training completion | ≥ 98% of **in-scope** workforce within statutory window | M07 (campaign engine) |

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### 2.1 In scope
1. Skill taxonomy and competency framework (categories, skills, competencies, proficiency-level catalog **with behavioural anchors**).
2. Role-based competency models with required proficiency targets, **scope key for ROLE**, **review cadence and ownership**.
3. Per-employee skill inventory with self/manager/validated assessment, **currency/expiry and freshness/decay**.
4. **Incremental** skill-gap analysis vs competency model and reconciled with M08 appraisal development gaps; **binary critical/non-critical at launch**, weighted scoring feature-flagged.
5. Training needs identification, consolidation, and prioritisation.
6. Annual training calendar and plan with budget allocation (**canonical org-unit + FY reconciliation key**).
7. Course catalog and program management: internal, external, e-learning/LMS, blended, micro-learning.
8. **Content & assessment-item management**: SCORM/xAPI content packages, versions, item banks, accessibility metadata.
9. Session/batch scheduling, trainer management, venue management, capacity and waitlist (**with persisted waitlist position**).
10. Nomination and multi-level approval workflow (maker-checker, budget sanction).
11. **Mandatory-compliance campaign engine**: bulk/wave nomination, rolling renewal, escalation, coverage tracking.
12. Attendance capture (per session/day) including **proxy/kiosk/assisted and offline-sync** capture for non-login staff; pre/post assessment; Kirkpatrick L1–L4 (L3/L4 optional/sampled/programme-level).
13. Certification issuance, validity, **enforced** renewal/recertification with auto re-nomination; lapsed-mandatory flag.
14. **External & professional credential capture with issuer verification.**
15. Induction/onboarding training.

17. **Vendor/external-trainer empanelment & procurement linkage.**
18. **Sponsorship / study-leave / deputation with service-bond obligation tracking.**
19. LMS/LRS integration (SCORM 1.2/2004 via reporting-API poll; xAPI via LRS) enrollment and completion sync.
20. Training budget and cost tracking (planned vs committed vs actual; **cost-per-completion**).
21. Posting of significant trainings/qualifications to the Digital Service Register (M12) using a **pinned event contract** and an explicit **`is_significant` rule set**.
22. **DPDP retention/erasure of learning PII** at employee exit.
23. **Published Gap Contract** consumed by M06/M08.

### 2.2 Out of scope (owned elsewhere)
- Employee master record and job data → **M01-EPM**.
- Appraisal goals, ratings, and the development-gap source data → **M08-PAM** (M07 consumes a read-only feed via the pinned contract).
- Promotion/seniority decisions that may consider training → **M06-PPP** (M07 supplies certification + Gap Contract data; decision is M06).
- Payroll disbursement of training reimbursements and sponsorship recoveries → **M10-PAY** (M07 supplies an approved-cost / bond-recovery payable feed only).
- Statutory SR ledger itself → **M12-SR** (M07 writes events; M12 owns the ledger and the event-contract authority).
- Document binary storage and encryption → **M13-DMS** (M07 stores `document_id` references).
- Cross-module executive dashboards → **M14-DAS** (M07 exposes datamarts/queries).
- **Procurement/tendering workflow itself** → external procurement system (M07 stores empanelment + contract references only).

### 2.4 Common Capabilities (inherited, applied throughout)
- **Audit:** every create/update/state-change writes to `audit_log` (FR-agnostic), including **FIFO waitlist promotions** and **campaign wave assignments**.
- **Soft delete:** `is_deleted` on all non-ledger entities; ledgers (assessment results, SR events, credential verifications, retention actions) are append-only.
- **Maker-checker:** nominations, budget changes, certificate revocation, credential verification override, vendor empanelment, sponsorship sanction, and master-data publication route through `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks`.
- **RBAC + row-level scoping:** all queries scoped by `org_unit_id` subtree of the actor.
- **Pagination:** all list endpoints paginated, hard max page size 100.
- **i18n / locale:** UTC storage, `DD-MMM-YYYY` display, INR currency default, banker's rounding to paise (see §5.6 rule 16).
- **Notifications:** state transitions raise `notifications` ledger entries (email/SMS/in-app).
- **Documents:** all uploads (certificates, materials, attendance sheets, invoices, verification evidence) reference `documents.document_id` (M13).

### 2.5 Capability phasing & feature flags (developmental layer gating)
The statutory spine ships **on by default**. The developmental layer is **feature-flagged** and gated on **framework-curation evidence** (≥ 80% of in-scope competency models within review-due date for the org-unit).

| Capability | Flag | Default at launch | Gate to enable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binary critical/non-critical gap | (always on) | ON | — |
| Weighted decimal gap scoring | `ff.gap.weighted` | OFF | Curation evidence + L&D Manager sign-off |
| AI/rule recommendation engine | `ff.recommendations` | OFF | Curation evidence |
| Skills marketplace | `ff.marketplace` | OFF | Curation evidence + DPDP opt-in live |
| CPD targets (vs tracking) | `ff.cpd.targets` | OFF | Phase 2 |
| LRS/xAPI ingestion | `ff.lms.lrs` | OFF | LRS provisioned & round-trip validated |

## 4. Shared Application Foundation

M07-TSD inherits the §5 technical defaults of the Foundation:
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, WCAG 2.1 AA — **extended in v2 to assessment content and hosted/authored e-learning, not only screens** (§9).
- **API:** REST under `/api/v1`, canonical error envelope, standard error codes plus module-specific codes (see §10).
- **Datastore:** PostgreSQL primary; object storage for documents via M13; **xAPI statements persisted in / proxied through a Learning Record Store (LRS)** (see FR-TSD-015).
- **Auth:** OIDC/SSO + MFA; JWT; RBAC + row-level org-unit scoping; **kiosk/assisted sessions use an attributed operator principal**.
- **Workflow:** shared `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks` engine for maker-checker and multi-level approvals.
- **Audit:** every state change writes immutable `audit_log`.
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP ASVS, TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest, India DPDP Act 2023 alignment (**incl. learning-PII erasure at exit**), statutory retention.
- **Integration bus:** asynchronous, idempotent event publication to M12-SR and M10-PAY; consumes M08-PAM development-gap feed and M01 employee master/joiner via internal APIs/events governed by **pinned contracts** (§10.6).

**Shared entities referenced (not redefined):** `employees` (M01), `org_units`, `users`, `roles`, `designations`, `cadres`, `audit_log`, `documents` (M13), `notifications`, `service_register_events` (M12), `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks`.

### 5.6 Data integrity rules
1. **Proficiency ordering:** `skill_gap_items.gap_size = max(0, target.level_order − current.level_order)`; never negative.
2. **One current skill row:** `UNIQUE(employee_id, skill_id)` on `employee_skills`; history lives in `skill_assessments`.
3. **No duplicate enrolment:** `UNIQUE(training_session_id, employee_id)` on `training_nominations`.
4. **Capacity invariant:** `training_sessions.enrolled_count ≤ capacity`; beyond capacity → status WAITLISTED with a **persisted `waitlist_position`** (v2), not APPROVED.
5. **Score bounds:** `0 ≤ obtained_score ≤ max_score`; `result = PASS` iff `obtained_score ≥ pass_threshold`.
6. **Date sanity:** `training_sessions.end_date ≥ start_date`; `nomination_deadline ≤ start_date`; `certifications.valid_until > issue_date`; `training_campaigns.window_end ≥ window_start`; `vendor_empanelments.valid_until ≥ valid_from`.
7. **Budget reconciliation — canonical key (v2, Risk #14).** The **single canonical reconciliation key is `(financial_year, org_unit_id)`**. `skill_category_id` and `competency_id` are **reporting dimensions only**, never reconciliation keys. Plan items, needs, nominations, and costs all roll up to the org-unit + FY budget. Worked example: budget `tb-8001` (ou-12, FY2026-2027) allocated ₹50,00,000. Plan items for ou-12 sum planned ₹48,00,000 (≤ allocated ✓). Approved nominations commit ₹12,00,000. Actual costs (trainer ₹2,00,000 + venue ₹1,00,000 + travel ₹50,000) = ₹3,50,000. Variance = allocated − (committed) = ₹38,00,000 remaining; utilisation = committed/allocated = 24%. Category/competency breakdowns are computed by tagging each cost with its program's category for **reporting**, but the invariant `committed + actual ≤ allocated` is evaluated only at the org-unit + FY grain.
8. **SR posting only when due:** `service_register_event_id` set only when `sr_posting_status = POSTED`; significant/mandatory certs require POSTED before status can become SUPERSEDED. **Significance is resolved by the `is_significant` rule set (FR-TSD-016), not ad-hoc.**
9. **Append-only ledgers:** `skill_assessments`, `training_assessments`, `training_feedback`, `cpd_records`, `credential_verifications`, `learning_data_retention_actions`, and SR events accept no UPDATE/DELETE.
10. **Segregation of duties:** `nominated_by ≠ approver`; budget `approved_by ≠ training_costs.created_by`; `vendor_empanelments` requester ≠ `approved_by`; credential `created_by` (self-capture) ≠ `verified_by`; retention requester ≠ DPO `approved_by`.
11. **Mandatory completion:** a mandatory/campaign program nomination cannot be CANCELLED/WITHDRAWN by the employee; only L&D with reason.
12. **Referential currency & freshness (v2):** an `employee_skill` with `expires_on < today` → `EXPIRED`; with `last_validated_at` older than `skill.revalidation_interval_months` (and not compliance-expired) → `freshness_status = STALE`. The nightly job sets both. STALE skills are **discounted from gap closure** per the configurable policy in FR-TSD-004.
13. **No polymorphic FKs (v2):** `training_attendance.marked_by_*` and `training_assessments.assessed_by_*` use an `actor_type` discriminator + `actor_id`; integrity enforced in the service layer / via partial FKs per actor_type. External trainers are never coerced into `employees`.
14. **Incremental gap recompute (v2):** gap analysis is recomputed **event-driven** on skill-change, validation, model-publish, and mandate-change events; a full batch is a fallback reconciliation, not the primary path (see §9 Performance).
15. **Campaign coverage denominator (v2):** for any campaign, `eligible_count = targets where is_eligible = true`; completion % is measured against `eligible_count`, and exemptions are explicitly recorded with reason — no silent denominator manipulation.
16. **Money rounding (v2):** all INR amounts rounded to paise using banker's rounding (round-half-to-even); reconciliation differences ≤ ₹0.01 are absorbed by the budget line owner and logged.
17. **Service-bond integrity (v2):** a `training_sponsorships` with `obligation_status = BREACHED` must produce a `BOND_RECOVERY` cost feeding M10 before it can move to RECOVERED.
18. **One primary LRS (v2):** exactly one `learning_record_stores` row may have `is_primary = true` (single-LMS-of-record decision).

### FR-TSD-001 — Skill Taxonomy & Competency Framework Management
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (maker), L&D Manager/SysAdmin (publish/approve), Auditor (read)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to define and publish a governed skill taxonomy and competency catalog so that all downstream skill and training processes use a single controlled vocabulary.
- **Description:** CRUD for `skill_categories`, `skills`, `competencies`, and `proficiency_levels` with a DRAFT→PUBLISHED→ARCHIVED lifecycle. Publication requires maker-checker. Compliance skills carry a default validity used to drive renewal. **(v2)** Non-compliance skills may carry a `revalidation_interval_months` for freshness; **proficiency levels require a concrete behavioural `descriptor`** so self-assessment produces signal.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An L&D Officer can create categories, skills, competencies, and proficiency levels in DRAFT.
  2. Publication of any master record requires L&D Manager approval via the workflow engine.
  3. PUBLISHED records cannot have their `code` changed; only ARCHIVE or new version.
  4. A skill flagged `is_compliance_skill=true` must have `default_validity_months` set.
  5. Archiving a category is blocked if it has PUBLISHED child skills (CONFLICT).
  6. **(v2)** A proficiency level cannot be PUBLISHED without a non-empty `descriptor` (behavioural anchor).
  7. **(v2)** A non-compliance skill may set `revalidation_interval_months`; if set it must be ≥ 1.
- **Business Rules:**
  - `code` is globally unique per entity and immutable once PUBLISHED.
  - Proficiency levels are globally ordered (`level_order` unique, contiguous, ascending), each with a behavioural anchor.
  - A competency may compose 0..N skills; deleting a skill referenced by a PUBLISHED competency is blocked.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `skill_categories` | C/R/U/Archive |
  | `skills` (incl. `revalidation_interval_months`) | C/R/U/Archive |
  | `competencies` | C/R/U/Archive |
  | `proficiency_levels` (mandatory `descriptor`) | C/R/U/Archive |
  | `audit_log`, `workflow_instances` | Write |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/skills`, `/api/v1/competencies`, `/api/v1/skill-categories`, `/api/v1/proficiency-levels` |
  | PATCH | `/api/v1/skills/{id}` (incl. `:publish`, `:archive`) |
  | GET | `/api/v1/skills?categoryId=&status=` (paginated) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Tree view of categories→skills; competency builder with skill multi-select; publish action shows confirmation and routes to checker. Status badges. Inline validation for compliance validity and **mandatory descriptor with helper text** (v2).
- **Edge Cases:** Duplicate `code` (409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT); archiving in-use master (409 IN_USE); reordering proficiency levels already referenced (allowed but warns, recomputes gaps lazily); **publishing a level without descriptor (422 VALIDATION_ERROR)** (v2).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `TaxonomyController`, `CompetencyService`, `MasterDataPublisher`, `WorkflowClient` |
  | Backend Flow | Validate (incl. descriptor, revalidation interval) → persist DRAFT → on publish create workflow_instance → on approval set PUBLISHED + audit |
  | Data Operations | Insert/update master tables; FK integrity checks before archive |
  | Validation | Unique/immutable `code`; compliance-validity required; descriptor required; contiguous level order |
  | Authorization | L&D Officer create/update; L&D Manager/SysAdmin publish; row scope = global master |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | DRAFT→PUBLISHED→ARCHIVED; publish notifies subscribers; gap caches invalidated |
  | Failure Handling | 409 duplicate/in-use; 422 missing validity/descriptor; rollback on workflow failure |
  | Dependencies | Workflow engine, audit_log, notifications |
  | Test Guidance | Code immutability; level ordering; descriptor enforcement; publish workflow |

### FR-TSD-002 — Role-Based Competency Models, Proficiency Targets & Governance
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (maker), L&D Manager (approve), model `owner_id` (steward)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to build versioned competency models mapped to designations/cadres/**roles**/org-units with target proficiency levels, an accountable owner, and a review cadence so that skill gaps are measured objectively and the framework does not silently rot.
- **Description:** Create `competency_models` with `competency_model_items` (competency + target proficiency + critical flag + optional weight), scoped by designation/**role**/cadre/org-unit/generic, with effective dating, versioning, **`owner_id` and `review_due_date`**. **(v2)** Adds the `role_id` scope key (closing the unsatisfiable-ROLE defect) and a staleness alarm.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A model can be scoped to a designation, **role (via `role_id`)**, cadre, org-unit, or generic; **exactly one scope key matches the `scope_type`** (GENERIC = all null). *(v2: now satisfiable for ROLE.)*
  2. Each item references a PUBLISHED competency and a valid proficiency target.
  3. Publishing a new version supersedes the prior version for the same scope on `effective_from`.
  4. A given employee resolves to exactly one effective model (most specific scope wins).
  5. **(v2)** Every model has an `owner_id` and a `review_due_date`; a model past its review-due date is flagged STALE in the governance report.
  6. **(v2)** Computing a FINALIZED gap analysis against a model past `review_due_date` is **allowed but warns** and stamps `model_stale_flag=true` on the analysis.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Effective periods for the same scope+version cannot overlap.
  - Scope resolution precedence: DESIGNATION > ROLE > CADRE > ORG_UNIT > GENERIC.
  - Weights (`weight`, default 1.0) drive **weighted** gap scoring only when `ff.gap.weighted` is ON; otherwise binary critical/non-critical applies (default at launch).
  - **(v2)** `review_due_date` defaults to `effective_from + 12 months` and is owner-editable within policy bounds.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `competency_models` (`role_id`,`owner_id`,`review_due_date`) | C/R/U/Version |
  | `competency_model_items` | C/R/U/D |
  | `competencies`, `proficiency_levels`, `roles` | R |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/competency-models` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/competency-models/{id}/items` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/competency-models/{id}:publish` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/effective-competency-model` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/competency-models/staleness-report?orgUnitId=` *(v2)* |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Model editor grid (competency, target level, critical toggle, weight when flag on); scope selector with dependent fields incl. **role picker**; version timeline; "resolve for employee" preview; **owner + review-due badge with overdue highlight** (v2).
- **Edge Cases:** Overlapping effective periods (409); no model resolves (GENERIC fallback or 404 with guidance); duplicate competency in a model (409); **ROLE scope without `role_id` (422)**; review-due in the past on publish (allowed, immediately flagged STALE).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `CompetencyModelService`, `ScopeResolver`, `ModelVersioner`, `StalenessReporter` |
  | Backend Flow | Validate single scope key (incl. role_id) → persist header+items DRAFT → publish creates version, closes prior effective_to → schedule review-due alarm |
  | Data Operations | Insert model+items; CHECK single-scope; effective-date range check |
  | Validation | Single scope key; published competency refs; non-overlap; owner+review_due required |
  | Authorization | L&D Officer maker; L&D Manager approve |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | New PUBLISHED version supersedes prior; invalidates gap caches; emits model-change event for incremental recompute |
  | Failure Handling | 409 overlap/duplicate; 422 invalid/missing scope key |
  | Dependencies | FR-TSD-001 masters; roles (M01/platform) |
  | Test Guidance | Scope precedence incl. ROLE; versioning; staleness flag propagation to FR-004 |

### FR-TSD-003 — Employee Skill Inventory, Assessment & Freshness
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (self-assess), Reporting Manager (validate), L&D Officer, Kiosk Operator (assisted)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to declare and maintain my skills with proficiency levels, have my manager validate them, and have stale skills flagged so that my skill profile is accurate and trusted over time.
- **Description:** Maintain `employee_skills` (one current row per skill) with full history in `skill_assessments`. Sources: self, manager, test, certification, import. Validation transitions DECLARED→VALIDATED. Currency/expiry tracked for renewable skills; **(v2) `last_validated_at` + `freshness_status` track decay for non-compliance skills**; assisted capture supports non-login staff (FR-TSD-022).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An employee (or Kiosk Operator on their behalf) can add/update a skill with a self-assessed proficiency level (status DECLARED).
  2. A manager can validate or adjust the proficiency (status VALIDATED, records validator + timestamp, **sets `last_validated_at`**).
  3. Every change appends an immutable `skill_assessments` row.
  4. A skill acquired via a PUBLISHED certificate auto-populates with source=CERTIFICATION and `expires_on` from cert validity.
  5. Skills past `expires_on` auto-transition to EXPIRED nightly.
  6. **(v2)** A VALIDATED non-compliance skill whose `last_validated_at` is older than `skill.revalidation_interval_months` is set `freshness_status=STALE` nightly and surfaced for re-validation.
  7. **(v2)** Self-assessment UI shows the proficiency-level **behavioural anchor** inline to reduce noise.
- **Business Rules:**
  - `UNIQUE(employee_id, skill_id)`; updates overwrite the current row, never duplicate.
  - Only the manager-of-record or L&D may VALIDATE; self-validation forbidden.
  - Evidence document optional for self, recommended for EXTERNAL.
  - **(v2)** STALE does not change `status` (still VALIDATED) but is discounted in gap closure (FR-TSD-004).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `employee_skills` (`last_validated_at`,`freshness_status`) | C/R/U |
  | `skill_assessments` | Append |
  | `documents`, `employees`, `skills`, `proficiency_levels` | R |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/skills` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/skills` |
  | PATCH | `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/skills/{skillId}` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/skills/{skillId}:validate` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/skills?freshness=STALE` *(v2)* |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Skill card grid with proficiency meter, source/validation badge, expiry chip, **freshness chip (Fresh/Stale)** (v2); manager "validate" inline action; evidence upload; expired skills flagged red, stale skills amber; **inline behavioural-anchor helper** (v2).
- **Edge Cases:** Manager validates a skill not declared (creates VALIDATED row source=MANAGER); concurrent self+manager edit (last write wins on current row, both appended to history); expiry on weekend handled by nightly job; **bulk re-validation of stale skills by manager** (v2).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `SkillInventoryService`, `AssessmentLedger`, `ExpiryJob`, `FreshnessJob` *(v2)*, `CertSkillSync` |
  | Backend Flow | Upsert current row → append assessment → set last_validated_at on validate → emit skill-change event for incremental gap recompute |
  | Data Operations | Upsert employee_skills; insert skill_assessments; nightly expiry + freshness update |
  | Validation | One row per (emp,skill); validator ≠ employee; level valid |
  | Authorization | Self/Kiosk for DECLARE; manager/L&D for VALIDATE; row scope by org subtree |

### FR-TSD-004 — Incremental Skill-Gap Analysis (Model + Appraisal Reconciliation)
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer, Reporting Manager, Employee (own)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want each employee's skill gaps computed incrementally against their effective competency model and reconciled with appraisal development gaps from M08 so that training needs are evidence-based and the engine scales to 200k employees.
- **Description:** Generate `skill_gap_analyses` + `skill_gap_items` by comparing resolved model targets to the employee's **fresh, validated** skills, then merging M08 development gaps (source=APPRAISAL) and statutory mandates (source=MANDATORY). **(v2)** Default `scoring_mode=BINARY` (critical/non-critical); weighted decimal scoring only when `ff.gap.weighted` is ON. Recompute is **event-driven/incremental** (skill, validation, model, mandate events), with a full batch only as reconciliation fallback. Emits the **Gap Contract** (FR-TSD-024) for M06/M08.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Gap analysis resolves the employee's effective model and computes `gap_size = max(0, target − current)` per competency.
  2. Appraisal development gaps for the latest cycle are imported and merged (no duplicates by competency).
  3. Mandatory/compliance competencies the employee lacks appear as **MANDATORY**-source gaps regardless of model.
  4. Finalizing a new analysis supersedes the prior FINALIZED one for the employee.
  5. Each gap item can be one-click converted into a `training_need` (1:1 source mapping — §5.5).
  6. **(v2)** Only VALIDATED **and FRESH** skills count toward closing a gap; STALE skills are discounted/excluded per configurable policy and counted in `stale_skill_count`; gap item flags `discounted_for_staleness`.
  7. **(v2)** Computing against a model past `review_due_date` stamps `model_stale_flag=true` and warns.
  8. **(v2)** At launch `scoring_mode=BINARY`; `overall_gap_score` is null unless weighted flag is ON.
  9. **(v2)** A skill-change event recomputes only the affected employee's analysis within the incremental SLA (§9), not a full-population batch.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Critical gap = `is_critical` competency with `gap_size ≥ 1`.
  - If M08 feed is unavailable, analysis proceeds with model+mandate sources and flags `appraisal_cycle_ref=UNAVAILABLE`.
  - **(v2)** Staleness discount policy is configurable: EXCLUDE (treat as no current skill) or DISCOUNT_ONE_LEVEL.
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-TSD-005 — Training Needs Identification & Consolidation
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Reporting Manager, L&D Officer, L&D Manager (prioritise)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to capture, consolidate, and prioritise individual and group training needs from gaps, appraisals, mandates, and manager input so that the annual plan is demand-driven.
- **Description:** Manage `training_needs` from multiple sources (normalised 1:1 with gap-item sources), deduplicate at individual/group level, prioritise, and roll up by org-unit/competency for plan input.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Needs can be created from a gap item, an appraisal gap, a mandate, manager input, self request, or induction.
  2. The system surfaces duplicate needs (same employee+competency, same FY) and prevents duplicates.
  3. L&D can consolidate multiple individual needs into a group need with a participant list.
  4. Needs carry a priority and a financial year and flow to status CONSOLIDATED then PLANNED.
  5. **(v2)** A gap item converts to a need with `source` mapped 1:1 (GAP_ANALYSIS/APPRAISAL/MANDATORY) — no mis-mapping.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Mandatory-source needs cannot be REJECTED, only DEFERRED with justification.
  - Group needs reference an org_unit and an implicit participant set.
  - Priority is derived-suggested (CRITICAL if from a critical gap or mandate) but L&D may override with reason.
- **Data Model References:**

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Needs inbox with source filters; consolidation wizard grouping by competency; priority editor; FY selector; duplicate warning banner.
- **Edge Cases:** Same need from gap and mandate (merged, MANDATORY wins); consolidating across org-units (blocked, scope mismatch); deferring a critical mandatory need requires manager+L&D dual sign-off.

### FR-TSD-006 — Annual Training Calendar, Plan & Budget Allocation
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (build), L&D Manager (approve), Dept Head/Finance (sanction)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Manager, I want to build and approve an annual training plan and calendar with budget allocation per org-unit so that delivery is governed and funded.
- **Description:** Compose `annual_training_plans` with `training_plan_items` from consolidated needs, allocate `training_budgets` on the **canonical (FY, org_unit) key**, and publish a quarter-bucketed calendar.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A plan can pull consolidated needs and propose plan items with target audience, man-days, and budget.
  2. Plan total budget must reconcile to allocated `training_budgets` for the **FY/org-unit** (category/competency are reporting dimensions only — v2).
  3. Approval requires L&D Manager; budget sanction requires Finance/Dept Head per policy.
  4. Once APPROVED→ACTIVE, sessions can be scheduled against plan items.
  5. A read-only annual calendar view aggregates sessions by quarter and org-unit.
- **Business Rules:**
  - `UNIQUE(financial_year, org_unit_id)` per plan.
  - Sum of `training_plan_items.planned_budget` ≤ allocated budget at the org-unit + FY grain (overrun requires explicit approval flag).
  - Closing a plan requires all items COMPLETED or DROPPED.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Plan builder with needs picker; budget reconciliation bar (allocated vs planned at org-unit grain); quarter calendar (Gantt-style); approval workflow stepper; **category/competency breakdown shown as reporting-only chips** (v2).
- **Edge Cases:** Plan exceeds budget (block unless overrun flag + dual approval); needs added after approval (amendment workflow, version note); FY rollover copies recurring mandatory programs (and seeds campaigns — FR-017).

### FR-TSD-007 — Course Catalog & Training Program Management
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (maker), L&D Manager (publish)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to maintain a catalog of training programs (internal, external, e-learning, blended, micro-learning) with outcomes, certification rules, and cost so that sessions, campaigns, and learning paths can be built from reusable programs.
- **Description:** CRUD for `training_programs` with delivery mode, provider type, mandatory/induction flags, linked competencies, CPD credits, certification-on-completion + validity, default cost and capacity, materials, and LMS course reference. **(v2)** E-learning programs reference an `lms_content_packages` version and an `learning_record_stores` connector rather than an implied webhook.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A program defines delivery mode, provider type, duration, and outcome competencies.
  2. Mandatory/induction flags are settable; mandatory programs must link ≥1 compliance competency.
  3. `certification_on_completion=true` requires a `cert_validity_months` (NULL = lifetime only if explicitly chosen).
  4. **(v2)** E-learning programs require a PUBLISHED `lms_content_packages` version and a designated LRS/LMS connector + standard.
  5. Retiring a program is blocked if it has OPEN/RUNNING sessions or an active campaign.
- **Business Rules:**
  - `code` unique and immutable once PUBLISHED.
  - CPD credits ≥ 0; default cost ≥ 0.
  - Linked competencies must be PUBLISHED.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `training_programs` | C/R/U/Retire |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Catalog grid + cards with filters; program editor with outcome competency picker, materials upload, **content-package picker + LRS connector** (v2), cost; mandatory/induction toggles surface dependent fields.
- **Edge Cases:** E-learning without content package (422); retire with active sessions/campaign (409); duplicate code (409).

### FR-TSD-008 — Session/Batch Scheduling, Trainer & Venue Management
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer, Trainer (view)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to schedule sessions/batches and manage trainers and venues with capacity so that delivery is logistically sound and conflict-free.
- **Description:** CRUD `training_sessions` (batch, dates, mode, venue/online URL, trainer, capacity, nomination deadline), plus `trainers` and `venues` management with conflict detection. **(v2)** External trainers link to an `vendor_empanelments` record (FR-TSD-019).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A session links to a PUBLISHED program and sets capacity, dates, mode, and nomination deadline.
  2. The system prevents scheduling a trainer or venue with an overlapping confirmed session (conflict).
  3. `end_date ≥ start_date` and `nomination_deadline ≤ start_date`.
  4. Online sessions require a meeting URL; classroom sessions require a venue with sufficient capacity.
  5. Cancelling a session cascades notifications and frees nominations to WITHDRAWN/re-nominate.
  6. **(v2)** Assigning an external trainer requires an EMPANELLED `vendor_empanelments` record valid for the session dates.
- **Business Rules:**
  - `batch_code` unique. Venue capacity ≥ session capacity for PHYSICAL. Trainer must have ≥1 matching expertise skill (warning, not hard block — **rationale now documented: surfaced for L&D judgement, never auto-blocking**).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `training_sessions` | C/R/U/Cancel |
  | `trainers`, `venues` | C/R/U |

### FR-TSD-009 — Nomination & Multi-Level Approval Workflow
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (self), Reporting Manager (L1), L&D Manager (L2), L&D Officer
- **User Story:** As a manager, I want to nominate employees (or approve self-nominations) for sessions through a maker-checker workflow with budget checks and **auditable** capacity/waitlist handling so that enrolment is controlled, funded, and fair.
- **Description:** Create `training_nominations` linked to a session and (ideally) a `training_need`, routed through the workflow engine, with L1/L2 approvals, budget commitment, capacity enforcement with **persisted FIFO waitlist position and audited promotion** (v2). Campaign-created nominations carry `training_campaign_id` and `nomination_type=CAMPAIGN`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An employee can self-nominate; a manager can nominate reports; L&D/HR can nominate anyone in scope.
  2. Nomination routes PENDING_L1→PENDING_L2→APPROVED; mandatory/induction/campaign may auto-approve per policy.
  3. On APPROVED, capacity is decremented; if full, nomination becomes WAITLISTED with a **persisted `waitlist_position`**.
  4. Approval commits estimated cost to the org-unit budget (FR-TSD-016); insufficient budget blocks approval unless overrun-approved.
  5. Withdrawal before the nomination deadline frees a seat and promotes the next waitlisted nomination by FIFO.
  6. **(v2)** Every waitlist promotion writes an `audit_log` entry (who/when/from-position) so seat allocation in over-subscribed mandatory sessions is auditable; `waitlist_position` is recomputed and persisted.
- **Business Rules:**
  - `nominated_by ≠ approver` at each level (SoD). `UNIQUE(session, employee)`. Mandatory/campaign nominations cannot be self-withdrawn; only L&D with reason. Waitlist promotion is FIFO by `waitlist_position` (assigned at WAITLIST time, immutable except on promotion/withdrawal compaction).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `training_nominations` (`waitlist_position`,`training_campaign_id`) | C/R/U |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Nominate dialog with need linkage and cost preview; approver task inbox; **capacity/waitlist indicator showing explicit position** (v2); budget-impact banner; SoD prevents self-approve (button hidden).
- **Edge Cases:** Approve when full (auto-waitlist, position assigned); budget exhausted (409 BUDGET_EXCEEDED unless override); employee on leave/transferred mid-flow (flag, allow L&D decision); duplicate nomination (409); **concurrent withdrawals causing position compaction (atomic recompute)** (v2).

### FR-TSD-010 — Attendance Capture (incl. Proxy/Kiosk/Offline)
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Trainer, L&D Officer, Kiosk Operator
- **User Story:** As a trainer, I want to mark per-day attendance for a session's roster — including for non-login field staff via kiosk/offline capture — so that completion and certification are accurate for the whole workforce.
- **Description:** Capture `training_attendance` per nomination per session-day with a **de-polymorphised `marked_by_actor_type`/`actor_id`** and a **`capture_mode`** (ONLINE/KIOSK/ASSISTED/OFFLINE_SYNC/LMS_DERIVED). Offline captures buffer on-device and sync via a batch (FR-TSD-022).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Trainer/L&D/Kiosk Operator can mark attendance for each enrolled (APPROVED) nomination per session day.
  2. One attendance record per nomination per day (`UNIQUE`).
  3. Attendance below the program's minimum threshold marks the nomination ineligible for certification.
  4. A fully-absent nomination is auto-marked NO_SHOW at session completion.
  5. For e-learning, attendance is derived from LMS/LRS progress (FR-TSD-015) with `capture_mode=LMS_DERIVED`.
  6. **(v2)** Offline-captured attendance carries `offline_captured_at` + `offline_sync_batch_id`; on sync, server-side dedupe/reconcile applies and conflicts are surfaced for L&D resolution.
  7. **(v2)** Every record records the operator via `actor_type`/`actor_id` (no polymorphic ambiguity).
- **Business Rules:**
  - Attendance markable only for sessions in RUNNING/COMPLETED. Minimum attendance % (default 80) configurable per program. EXCUSED days excluded from the denominator.
  - **(v2)** Kiosk/assisted captures require an authenticated Kiosk Operator principal and are fully attributed in audit.

### FR-TSD-011 — Assessment (Pre/Post) & Kirkpatrick Evaluation
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Trainer, L&D Officer, Employee (feedback)
- **User Story:** As a trainer, I want to record pre/post assessment scores and collect Kirkpatrick feedback at the right level so that learning effectiveness and impact are measurable without specifying features that ship empty.
- **Description:** Append-only `training_assessments` (PRE/POST/REASSESSMENT, **de-polymorphised assessor**) and `training_feedback` across Kirkpatrick levels. **(v2)** L1/L2 are per-participant; **L3 (behaviour) and L4 (results) are explicitly optional, sampled, and programme-level**, and L4 links to named M14 business KPIs — not fictional per-employee T+90 surveys.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Pre and post assessments can be recorded per nomination; POST result drives completion PASS/FAIL.
  2. Learning gain = POST − PRE is computed and reportable.
  3. Participants can submit L1/L2 feedback (anonymous-capable).
  4. Trainer `avg_feedback_rating` is derived from L1 ratings.
  5. A nomination with POST result FAIL is ineligible for certification (re-assessment allowed).
  6. **(v2)** L3/L4 feedback is captured at programme level on a **sample** of participants/cohorts, marked optional; the UI never blocks completion on missing L3/L4.
  7. **(v2)** L4 `responses_json` references one or more named M14 business-KPI keys to enable cost-per-outcome analysis.
  8. **(v2)** Assessment content (item banks, SCORM quizzes) meets WCAG 2.1 AA (FR-TSD-021).
- **Business Rules:**
  - `0 ≤ obtained_score ≤ max_score`; `result=PASS` iff `obtained ≥ pass_threshold`. Feedback ledger append-only and anonymisable. L4 can be session/org-level (nomination NULL).
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-TSD-012 — Certification, Enforced Validity & Renewal; Mandatory Compliance
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (issue), L&D Manager (approve revoke)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to issue certificates, and have validity **enforced** — not merely notified — with automatic renewal so that statutory training obligations are continuously met and lapses are actionable.
- **Description:** Issue `certifications` on completion, generate certificate numbers and PDFs (M13), track `valid_until` and renewal, auto-expire, support revocation (workflow), and produce a mandatory-compliance currency view. **(v2)** On mandatory-cert expiry the system **auto-creates a renewal training need + campaign re-nomination** and sets `lapsed_mandatory=true`, a flag consumable by M06 sensitive-duty/posting checks.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A certificate issues only when the nomination is COMPLETED with attendance threshold met and POST=PASS (where applicable).
  2. `certificate_no` is unique and immutable; a PDF is generated and stored via M13.
  3. Certificates past `valid_until` auto-transition to EXPIRED nightly and notify employee/manager.
  4. Renewal reminders fire at configurable lead times (60/30/7 days).
  5. A mandatory-compliance dashboard shows each employee's required vs held vs lapsed mandatory certs.
  6. **(v2)** On EXPIRED of a **mandatory** cert, the system auto-creates a renewal `training_need` (`renewal_need_id`) and enrolls the employee into the relevant rolling campaign (FR-TSD-017).
  7. **(v2)** `lapsed_mandatory=true` is set on expiry and exposed via API for M06 to block sensitive duty/posting.
  8. **(v2)** Lapse is cleared only when a fresh valid mandatory cert is issued (SUPERSEDED chain).
- **Business Rules:**
  - Revocation requires L&D Manager approval + reason; sets REVOKED and (if posted) flags an SR correction. Issuing a renewable cert updates linked `employee_skill.expires_on` and `last_validated_at`. Significant/mandatory certs trigger SR posting (FR-TSD-016) with `sr_posting_status=PENDING`.

### FR-TSD-013 — Induction / Onboarding Training Program
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer, HR Officer, Reporting Manager
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want new entrants auto-enrolled into a structured induction program with tracked completion so that onboarding is consistent and compliant.
- **Description:** On a new-joiner event from M01 (**pinned joiner contract §10.6**), auto-create induction needs and nominations into the configured induction program/learning path, track completion within an onboarding window, and escalate non-completion.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A new-joiner event (M01 `date_of_joining`) triggers auto-nomination into the active induction program(s).
  2. Induction completion is tracked against an onboarding window (30/60/90 days).
  3. Non-completion within the window escalates to manager and L&D.
  4. Induction modules can be classroom, e-learning, or blended and reuse FR-TSD-007 programs.
  5. Induction completion contributes to mandatory-compliance status (FR-TSD-012).
  6. **(v2)** The joiner event conforms to the pinned M01 contract; missing/late events are reconciled idempotently.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Induction nominations are type=INDUCTION and may auto-approve per policy. The induction program/path is configurable per cadre/designation. Missing induction is a surfaced compliance exception.

### FR-TSD-014 — Learning Paths, Recommendations, CPD & Skills Marketplace (Phase 2)
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (curate), Employee (consume), Reporting Manager
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want personalised learning paths, skill-based recommendations, CPD tracking, and a skills marketplace so that I can grow toward my role and aspirations.
- **Description:** Curate `learning_paths` + `learning_path_items`; generate gap-driven recommendations; track `cpd_records`; expose a skills marketplace. **(v2)** The **recommendation engine and marketplace are feature-flagged Phase-2** capabilities gated on framework-curation evidence (§2.5); CPD tracking ships at launch, CPD targets are Phase 2. Learning paths (curated) ship at launch.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. L&D can curate published learning paths; the recommendation engine (when `ff.recommendations` ON) can generate suggested paths from gaps.
  2. An employee sees a ranked recommendation list mapped to their critical gaps (when flag ON).
  3. Completing a program awards CPD credits per `cpd_credits`, appended to `cpd_records`.
  4. CPD totals are aggregated per credit year; CPD **targets** shown only when `ff.cpd.targets` ON.
  5. The skills marketplace (when `ff.marketplace` ON) lists employees with surplus proficiency as mentors/SMEs, **opt-in only**.
  6. **(v2)** With developmental flags OFF, screens show curated paths + CPD tracking and clearly mark recommendation/marketplace as "coming in Phase 2", never broken/empty controls.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Recommendations prioritise CRITICAL > HIGH gaps and mandates. CPD append-only, credits ≥ 0, verified flagged. Marketplace opt-in (consent) and DPDP-respecting; opt-out hides the employee entirely (and FR-TSD-023 erases presence on exit).
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-TSD-015 — LMS/LRS Integration (SCORM Poll / xAPI LRS) & E-Learning Sync
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** SysAdmin (config), L&D Officer, Employee (learner)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want e-learning enrolments to sync progress and completion from the LMS via a **technically correct** mechanism (xAPI LRS or SCORM reporting-API poll) so that online learning is tracked without manual entry and without relying on a non-existent SCORM webhook.
- **Description:** **(v2, Risk #1 — full rewrite.)** SCORM 1.2/2004 has **no server-to-server completion push**; its run-time API is client-side inside the hosting LMS. v2 therefore models integration explicitly:
  - **xAPI:** content emits statements to a **Learning Record Store (LRS)** (`learning_record_stores.connector_type=LRS_XAPI`); M07 ingests statements from the LRS (idempotent by `lms_statement_id`).
  - **SCORM:** M07 **polls the hosting LMS reporting API** (`connector_type=LMS_REPORTING_API`, `sync_mode=SCORM_POLL`) on `poll_interval_minutes`, advancing `last_poll_cursor`. **No webhook push is assumed.**
  - **Self-hosted SCORM:** if content is hosted in-platform (`SCORM_SELF_HOSTED`), a content player + sequencing engine consumes the client-side run-time and writes progress server-side.
  - **Single-vs-multi-LMS:** exactly one `is_primary` LRS/LMS is the system of record (§5.6 rule 18); others are secondary read sources. Content hosting ownership is declared per `lms_content_packages.hosting`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Approving a nomination for an e-learning program provisions an `lms_enrollment` bound to a `learning_record_stores` connector and (if self-hosted) an `lms_content_packages` version.
  2. Learners launch the course via SSO deep-link; no separate LMS login.
  3. **(v2)** For xAPI, completion/progress is ingested from the **LRS**; for SCORM, via **scheduled poll of the LMS reporting API** — not a push webhook.
  4. xAPI statements are idempotent — a repeated `lms_statement_id` is ignored; SCORM polls are idempotent by cursor + enrolment.
  5. Completion auto-derives attendance (`capture_mode=LMS_DERIVED`) and triggers certification eligibility.
  6. **(v2)** Persistent sync failure flags the enrolment for manual reconciliation; the connector exposes health metrics (sync lag, last cursor).
- **Business Rules:**
  - Supported standards: SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, xAPI; NONE for non-tracked. `progress_pct` ∈ [0,100]; COMPLETED requires progress ≥ program criterion. Sync failures retry with backoff. **No integration path assumes a SCORM server push.**

### FR-TSD-016 — Service Register Posting (with `is_significant` Rule Set) & Budget/Cost Tracking
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer/Manager, Finance/Budget Controller, SR Custodian (receive)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Manager, I want significant trainings and qualifications posted to the Digital Service Register using a **pinned, auditable significance rule** and full budget/cost tracking on a **single canonical key** so that statutory records are complete and spend reconciles.
- **Description:** Post significant training completions and certifications as append-only `service_register_events` to M12 (idempotent, retry/failure handling, **pinned event contract §10.6**), and maintain `training_budgets`/`training_costs` with planned→committed→actual tracking on the **canonical (FY, org_unit) key**, reimbursement/bond-recovery payable feed to M10, cost-per-completion, and budget variance reporting. **(v2)** Significance is resolved by an explicit, configurable `is_significant` rule set (promoted from former Appendix D).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. The `is_significant` rule set determines posting: a completion/cert is significant if **any** of: (a) mandatory certification, (b) externally accredited/professional credential (FR-TSD-018), (c) program duration ≥ configured threshold, (d) flagged promotion-relevant (M06), (e) sponsored degree/deputation (FR-TSD-020). The resolved decision and matched rule(s) are stored and auditable.
  2. Significant items post to M12 as append-only SR events conforming to the pinned contract (idempotent by source ref).
  3. Posting state is tracked (NOT_REQUIRED/PENDING/POSTED/FAILED) with automatic retry on FAILED.
  4. Approved nominations commit cost to the relevant `training_budget` (`committed_amount`) at the canonical key.
  5. Actual costs reduce remaining budget and reconcile to invoices.
  6. Reimbursement/bond-recovery costs flagged `payable_to_payroll` emit an approved-payable feed to M10.
  7. Budget variance (allocated vs committed vs actual) is reportable per org-unit/FY; **category/competency are reporting dimensions only**.
  8. **(v2)** `cost_per_completion` is computed (actual cost ÷ completions) for ROI analytics (FR-TSD-011 L4 linkage).
- **Business Rules:**
  - SR events append-only; corrections post a new corrective event. `committed + actual ≤ allocated` at the canonical key unless overrun allowed (FROZEN blocks all new commitment). Cost approver ≠ creator (SoD); payable feed only for APPROVED costs.

### FR-TSD-017 — Mandatory-Compliance Campaign Engine *(new, Risk #2 Critical)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (run), L&D Manager (approve), Dept Head (sanction scope)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to launch a mandatory-training campaign that bulk-nominates an entire scope (org-unit/cadre/designation/all-staff), auto-waves participants into capacity-bounded sessions, drives rolling annual renewal, and escalates non-completion so that ~200k annual mandatory completions are actually achievable.
- **Description:** Create `training_campaigns` and resolve `campaign_targets` for the scope (honouring the **coverage denominator rule**). Bulk-create nominations (`nomination_type=CAMPAIGN`) and auto-assign waves into sessions up to `wave_size`/capacity, creating sessions as needed. Run a **rolling-renewal scheduler** (`renewal_cadence_months`) that re-targets employees whose certs near expiry, and an **escalation engine** by lead times. Reaches non-login staff via FR-TSD-022.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A campaign resolves its target population from scope and the coverage denominator rule, marking ineligible targets EXEMPT with reason.
  2. `:enroll-batch` bulk-creates nominations for all eligible targets idempotently (re-running does not duplicate).
  3. `auto_wave=true` assigns targets to waves and capacity-bounded sessions, creating additional sessions when capacity is exceeded.
  4. A rolling-renewal scheduler re-targets employees `renewal_cadence_months` before cert expiry (ties to FR-TSD-012 auto-renewal).
  5. Escalation fires per `escalation_policy_json` to employee→manager→L&D as due dates approach/pass; `escalation_level` increments.
  6. A campaign dashboard shows coverage % (against eligible denominator), per-wave progress, overdue list, and exemptions.
  7. **(v2)** Completion of a campaign target updates `campaign_targets.target_status` and feeds mandatory-compliance status (FR-TSD-012).
- **Business Rules:**
  - Bulk nomination respects per-session capacity and budget (FR-TSD-009/016); over-capacity spills to new waves/sessions, never breaks the capacity invariant.
  - Campaign nominations are mandatory and cannot be self-withdrawn (§5.6 rule 11).
  - Coverage % always uses the eligible denominator (§5.6 rule 15); exemptions are explicit and audited.
  - A campaign cannot move to RUNNING without an approved scope and a published mandatory program.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Campaign wizard (program, scope, window, renewal cadence, denominator rule, wave size, escalation); coverage dashboard with eligible/exempt/overdue breakdown; wave board; bulk-action confirmations with impact preview (target count, sessions to be created, budget impact).
- **Edge Cases:** Scope changes mid-campaign (re-resolve targets, additive only, audited); employee transfers (target follows employee/org per policy); insufficient capacity org-wide (auto-create sessions or surface a scheduling gap); re-running enroll-batch (idempotent); employees on long leave (EXEMPT per denominator rule).

### FR-TSD-018 — External & Professional Credential Capture & Verification *(new, Risk #6)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (submit), L&D Officer (verify), L&D Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to record externally-acquired professional credentials (e.g., PMP, CISA, a statutory licence) with evidence so that my significant qualifications are recognised and posted to the service register regardless of who delivered the training.
- **Description:** Capture `certifications` with `credential_source=EXTERNAL_PROFESSIONAL`, `issuing_body`, `external_reference_no`, and verification workflow recorded in the append-only `credential_verifications` ledger. Verified significant credentials are eligible for SR posting (FR-TSD-016) and can populate the skill inventory.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An employee/L&D can create an external credential with issuing body, reference number, dates, and evidence document.
  2. Verification routes through L&D: SUBMITTED→EVIDENCE_REVIEWED→VERIFIED/REJECTED, each appended to `credential_verifications`.
  3. A VERIFIED credential with a renewable validity sets `valid_until` and can update `employee_skills`.
  4. A VERIFIED credential meeting the `is_significant` rule (FR-TSD-016) becomes SR-posting eligible.
  5. Self-capture creator ≠ verifier (SoD).
  6. **(v2)** Rejected credentials retain the immutable verification trail and are not deleted.
- **Business Rules:**
  - External credentials need not link a `training_program_id`. Verification method recorded (DOCUMENT/ISSUER_PORTAL/THIRD_PARTY/MANUAL_ATTEST). Only VERIFIED credentials post to SR.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Credential submission form (body, reference, dates, evidence upload); verification queue for L&D with evidence viewer; status badges (Pending/Verified/Rejected); SR-eligibility indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Duplicate external reference for same employee (409); evidence missing on submit (422 if policy requires); verifier = submitter (403 SoD); credential expiry behaves like FR-TSD-012.

### FR-TSD-019 — Vendor / External-Trainer Empanelment & Procurement Linkage *(new, Risk #15)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Vendor/Empanelment Manager, L&D Manager (approve), Finance
- **User Story:** As an L&D Manager, I want external trainers/providers empanelled with contract and procurement references so that external training costs tie to an approved vendor and public-sector procurement controls are honoured.
- **Description:** Maintain `vendor_empanelments` with empanelment status, contract/procurement references, validity, and rate cards; link external `trainers` and external `training_costs` to an empanelled vendor.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A vendor empanelment captures name, empanelment ref, contract/procurement refs, validity, and rate card.
  2. Empanelment requires approval (requester ≠ approver, SoD); status flows DRAFT→PENDING_APPROVAL→EMPANELLED.
  3. External trainers may be linked to an EMPANELLED vendor; sessions with external trainers require valid empanelment (FR-TSD-008).
  4. External `training_costs` must reference an EMPANELLED vendor within validity.
  5. Suspended/blacklisted/expired vendors cannot be assigned to new sessions or costs.
- **Business Rules:**
  - `empanelment_ref` unique. Empanelment validity must cover session/cost dates. Blacklisting cascades a block on new assignments (existing history preserved).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `vendor_empanelments` | C/R/U |
  | `trainers` | R/U (link) |
  | `training_costs` | R (linkage) |

  | POST | `/api/v1/vendor-empanelments/{id}:approve` / `:suspend` / `:blacklist` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/vendor-empanelments?status=&validOn=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Empanelment register with status and validity; contract/procurement reference fields and document upload; rate-card editor; approval workflow stepper; block warnings on assigning non-empanelled vendors.
- **Edge Cases:** Cost referencing expired empanelment (409); blacklisting a vendor with active sessions (block new, flag existing); duplicate empanelment ref (409); self-approval (403).

### FR-TSD-020 — Sponsorship / Study-Leave / Deputation & Service-Obligation *(new, Risk #15)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), Reporting Manager (recommend), Dept Head (sanction), Finance (recovery)
- **User Story:** As an appointing authority, I want to sanction long-duration sponsored training (degrees, deputation, study-leave) with a service bond and track the obligation so that public funds are recoverable on breach.
- **Description:** Model `training_sponsorships` with sponsored amount, service-bond duration, derived bond-end date, obligation status, and breach→recovery handling that feeds a `BOND_RECOVERY` cost to M10 (FR-TSD-016).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A sponsorship captures type, sponsored amount, dates, bond months, and links a program or external course.
  2. Sanction routes through recommend→sanction (Dept Head); status flows PROPOSED→SANCTIONED→ACTIVE.
  3. On completion the bond becomes ACTIVE until `bond_end_date`; fulfilling the term sets FULFILLED.
  4. Early exit/breach sets BREACHED and computes `bond_recovery_amount` (pro-rata per policy).
  5. **(v2)** A BREACHED bond must emit a `BOND_RECOVERY` cost (`payable_to_payroll`) before moving to RECOVERED (§5.6 rule 17).
  6. Waivers require authority approval and are audited (WAIVED).
- **Business Rules:**
  - `bond_end_date = completion_date + service_bond_months`. Recovery amount per configurable pro-rata formula. Bond recoveries route to M10 via the payable feed.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `training_sponsorships` | C/R/U |
  | `training_costs` (SPONSORSHIP, BOND_RECOVERY) | C |

  | POST | `/api/v1/training-sponsorships/{id}:compute-recovery` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/training-sponsorships?status=&employeeId=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Sponsorship request form; approval stepper; bond timeline with end date; breach action with computed recovery preview; recovery-to-payroll status; waiver dialog with reason.
- **Edge Cases:** Resignation during bond (auto-flag BREACHED, compute recovery); transfer within org (bond continues); waiver after partial recovery (audited); deceased/retired (policy-driven waiver).

  |---|---|
  | Components | `SponsorshipService`, `BondCalculator`, `RecoveryEmitter` (to M10) |

### FR-TSD-021 — Content & Assessment-Item Management *(new, Risk #12, #16)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (author/curate), SysAdmin (host config), Auditor (read)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to author and version SCORM/xAPI content packages and assessment item banks with accessibility metadata so that e-learning and tests are hosted, versioned, and WCAG-conformant — not just a loose document reference.
- **Description:** Manage `lms_content_packages` (versioned SCORM/xAPI/self-hosted packages with `hosting` and `wcag_conformance`) and `assessment_items` (item bank with question types, keys, versions, accessibility). Content may be self-hosted (player in FR-TSD-015) or delegated to an external LMS with a documented contract.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A content package is versioned per program with a declared standard and hosting model.
  2. Packages and items carry `wcag_conformance` (AA/A/NON_CONFORMANT/UNKNOWN); NON_CONFORMANT content cannot be PUBLISHED for mandatory programs without an accessibility-exception approval.
  3. Assessment items support single/multi-choice, true/false, numeric, free-text, with versioning; correct keys are RBAC-restricted.
  4. Publishing a new package version supersedes the prior for new enrolments; in-flight enrolments retain their launched version.
  5. **(v2)** Content accessibility is testable and reported; assessment content meets WCAG 2.1 AA (extends §9).
- **Business Rules:**
  - `UNIQUE(training_program_id, package_version)`. Correct keys never returned to learners. Self-hosted packages store the binary via M13.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `lms_content_packages` | C/R/U/Retire |
  | `assessment_items` | C/R/U/Retire |
  | `training_programs`, `documents` | R |

  | GET | `/api/v1/programs/{id}/content-packages` |
  | PATCH | `/api/v1/content-packages/{id}` (`:publish`,`:retire`) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Package manager with version history, standard, hosting, WCAG badge; item-bank editor with type-specific fields and accessibility checklist; key fields masked for non-authors; accessibility-exception workflow.
- **Edge Cases:** NON_CONFORMANT mandatory content (blocked without exception); duplicate version (409); retiring a package with active enrolments (in-flight retain version); leaking correct keys (forbidden by RBAC).
- **LLD:**

### FR-TSD-022 — Proxy / Kiosk / Assisted Mode & Offline Attendance Sync *(new, Risk #9)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Kiosk Operator, Reporting Manager (proxy), L&D Officer
- **User Story:** As a Kiosk Operator, I want to launch e-learning, capture self-assessment, and record attendance on behalf of non-login field/clerical staff — including offline with later sync — so that the whole workforce is reachable and compliance KPIs are attainable.
- **Description:** Provide an attributed assisted/kiosk mode for skill self-assessment, e-learning launch, and attendance capture for employees without an individual login, plus offline buffering and reconciliation. Defines the **compliance-coverage denominator** (who is in-scope vs exempt) used by campaigns (FR-TSD-017).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A Kiosk Operator authenticates and selects an employee (by service_no) to assist; all actions are attributed to both operator and employee in audit.
  2. Assisted self-assessment writes `employee_skills`/`skill_assessments` with source=SELF and operator attribution.
  3. Kiosk e-learning launch maps the employee to an `lms_user_ref` for sync (FR-TSD-015).
  4. Offline attendance captures buffer locally with `offline_captured_at` and sync via `:offline-sync` (FR-TSD-010), deduped server-side.
  5. **(v2)** The coverage denominator classifies each employee as eligible/exempt (e.g., long-leave, unmapped non-login) for campaign metrics; classification is auditable and policy-driven.
  6. Assisted/kiosk capture never bypasses SoD or validation rules of the underlying FR.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Kiosk Operator is a real authenticated principal; no anonymous capture. Offline buffers are encrypted and reconciled idempotently by (nomination, date). Denominator rules are configurable per campaign (§5.6 rule 15).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `training_attendance` (KIOSK/ASSISTED/OFFLINE_SYNC) | C/R/U |
  | `employee_skills`, `skill_assessments` | C (assisted) |
  | `lms_enrollments` | C (kiosk launch) |
  | `campaign_targets` | R/U (denominator) |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|

  | POST | `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/attendance:offline-sync` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/coverage/eligibility?campaignId=&employeeId=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Kiosk-optimised, large-touch UI; employee selector by service_no; assisted forms with behavioural-anchor help; offline indicator with pending-sync count and conflict resolution queue; operator attribution always visible.
- **Edge Cases:** Offline clock skew (server reconciles, flags); duplicate offline + online mark (dedupe, conflict surfaced); operator assisting outside org scope (403); unmapped employee with no service_no (denominator EXEMPT with reason).
- **LLD:**

### FR-TSD-023 — DPDP Retention & Erasure of Learning PII at Exit *(new, Risk #13)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** Data Protection Officer (approve/execute), L&D Officer, Auditor
- **User Story:** As the DPO, I want defined retention/erasure of learning PII when an employee exits so that DPDP obligations are met while statutory SR-posted records are preserved.
- **Description:** On employee exit (RETIRED/RESIGNED/TERMINATED/DECEASED) or a data-subject erasure request, apply configured retention/erasure actions to self-assessments, anonymous-feedback authorship, marketplace presence, and skill inventory, recording each action append-only in `learning_data_retention_actions`. Statutory-retention overrides preserve SR-posted certs and required records.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An exit/erasure event resolves a retention/erasure plan per policy: anonymise self-assessments, detach feedback authorship, erase marketplace presence, retain statutory records.
  2. SR-posted certifications and statutory records are flagged `retention_override=true` and preserved.
  3. Each action is appended to `learning_data_retention_actions` with DPO approval; the ledger is immutable.
  4. Marketplace presence is removed immediately on exit regardless of prior opt-in.
  5. **(v2)** An export action can produce a data-subject export before erasure where required.
  6. Erasure requester ≠ DPO approver (SoD).
- **Business Rules:**
  - Append-only ledger; no destructive action without DPO approval. Statutory retention always wins over erasure for SR-posted/legally-required records. PII minimisation in logs throughout.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `learning_data_retention_actions` | Append |
  | `employee_skills`, `skill_assessments`, `training_feedback`, `certifications` | U/anonymise (per action) |

  | GET | `/api/v1/learning-data/retention-actions?employeeId=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/learning-data/export?employeeId=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** DPO console listing exit/erasure cases; per-action checklist with statutory-override flags; approval workflow; immutable action history; export download.
- **Edge Cases:** SR-posted cert under erasure request (retained, documented to subject); re-employment after erasure (new profile, no resurrection of erased PII); deceased employee (next-of-kin/policy handling); partial erasure with statutory holds.

### FR-TSD-024 — Published Gap Contract for M06 / M08 *(new, Risk #3, launch-required primitive)*
- **Module:** M07-TSD
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (publish), Integration/SysAdmin, Auditor
- **User Story:** As the owner of M06/M08 integration, I want a stable, versioned Gap Contract describing each employee's competency gaps so that promotion (M06) and appraisal (M08) consume a guaranteed primitive even while the developmental layer is phased.
- **Description:** Project a versioned, read-only **Gap Contract v1** from `skill_gap_analyses` + `skill_gap_items`: per (employee, model) the list of competencies with a positive gap, each flagged critical/non-critical, with staleness/model-stale indicators. This is the launch-required sibling-compatible primitive that lets weighted scoring/marketplace/recommendations remain feature-flagged Phase 2 without breaking M06/M08.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. The Gap Contract exposes: `employeeId`, `competencyModelId`, `generatedOn`, `scoringMode`, `modelStaleFlag`, and an array of `{competencyId, isCritical, gapSize, discountedForStaleness}`.
  2. The contract is versioned (`v1`) and changes are backward-compatible or version-bumped (`v2`), never silently altered.
  3. M06 and M08 read the contract via a stable endpoint; the schema is registered in the dependency register (§10.6).
  4. The contract reflects the latest FINALIZED analysis; SUPERSEDED analyses are not exposed.
  5. **(v2)** Binary critical/non-critical is always present; weighted fields appear only when `ff.gap.weighted` is ON, and consumers are not required to use them.
- **Business Rules:**
  - The contract is read-only and projection-only (no side effects). Versioning is explicit; breaking changes require a new version path. Row-level scoping applies to consumers.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | `skill_gap_analyses`, `skill_gap_items` | R (projection) |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/gap-contract/v1?employeeId=&modelId=` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/gap-contract/v1/batch?orgUnitId=&fy=` (paginated) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** No direct UI; an admin "contract schema & version" reference page and a consumer-access audit view.
- **Edge Cases:** No FINALIZED analysis (empty contract with reason); consumer requests out-of-scope employee (403); version negotiation via path.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `GapContractProjector`, `ContractVersionRegistry` |
  | Backend Flow | On FINALIZE (FR-004) → project contract → serve read-only to M06/M08; version pinned |
  | Data Operations | Read-only projection from analyses+items |

  | Authorization | Consumers (M06/M08) via service auth + row scope; Auditor read |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | None (read-only) |
  | Failure Handling | Empty contract on no analysis; 403 out-of-scope |

| Resilience | RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h; idempotent SR/LMS/payroll integrations with retry + DLQ; resumable batch/campaign jobs. |
| Security | OWASP ASVS L2; TLS 1.2+; encryption at rest; RBAC + row-level org scoping; **no polymorphic-FK integrity gaps (actor_type)**; signed service auth for LRS ingest; secrets via env/secret manager; **kiosk operators attributed, never anonymous**. |
| Privacy (v2) | India DPDP Act 2023 alignment incl. **retention/erasure of learning PII at exit (FR-TSD-023)**; anonymous feedback; marketplace opt-in + exit removal; PII minimisation; no PII in logs; encrypted offline buffers. |
| Auditability | Every state change in `audit_log`; append-only ledgers immutable; full traceability need→nomination→cert→SR; **waitlist promotions, campaign waves, significance decisions, and erasure actions audited**. |
| Accessibility (v2) | WCAG 2.1 AA across all screens **and across assessment content (item banks, pre/post tests) and hosted/authored e-learning (`lms_content_packages.wcag_conformance`)**; NON_CONFORMANT mandatory content blocked without exception. |
| Observability | Structured logs with `requestId`; metrics for nomination throughput, **campaign coverage**, SR posting success, **LRS/LMS sync lag & poll-cursor health**, incremental-gap recompute latency; alerting on FAILED postings and stuck campaigns. |
| Data retention | Statutory retention for certifications/SR-posted training (lifetime); operational data per schedule; erasure honours statutory overrides. |
| Localisation | UTC storage; locale display; INR default with banker's rounding; i18n-ready strings. |

## 14. Migration & Launch

### 14.1 Data migration
| Source | Target | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy skill/competency lists | `skill_categories`/`skills`/`competencies` | Map → validate → bulk import (source=IMPORT); **descriptors required before PUBLISH (v2)**; L&D review |
| Existing employee qualifications/certs | `certifications`, `employee_skills` | Import with `sr_posting_status=NOT_REQUIRED` for historical; flag significant for back-posting; **set `last_validated_at` from import date (v2)** |
| **Externally-acquired credentials (v2)** | `certifications` (EXTERNAL_PROFESSIONAL) | Import with `verification_status=PENDING`; L&D verifies before SR eligibility |
| Historical training records | `training_programs`/`sessions`/`nominations` (closed) | Load as COMPLETED for history/analytics |
| Legacy budgets | `training_budgets` | Load current+prior FY at canonical org-unit+FY key for variance baselines |
| **Vendor/empanelment master (v2)** | `vendor_empanelments` | Import EMPANELLED vendors with contract/procurement refs |
| **E-learning content (v2)** | `lms_content_packages` | Register existing SCORM/xAPI packages with version + WCAG metadata; declare hosting + primary LRS |

### 14.2 Cutover & launch (v2 — statutory spine first, Risk #25)
1. **Pin cross-module contracts first** (M12 SR-event, M01 joiner, M08 gap-feed, Gap Contract v1 — §10.6) with owning modules.
2. Load and publish taxonomy, proficiency levels (**with descriptors**), competencies, and **governed** models (owner + review-due). Gate: L&D sign-off.
3. Stand up program catalog (FR-007) + content packages (FR-021) + **primary LRS/LMS connector** (FR-015) validated round-trip.
4. **Prove the statutory spine end-to-end on ONE pilot department:** a **campaign-based** mandatory-compliance enrolment (FR-017) → attendance incl. kiosk/offline (FR-010/022) → completion → certification (FR-012) → idempotent **SR posting** (FR-016). Reconcile in audit.
5. Import employee skills/certs + external credentials; run reconciliation report (zero unmatched employees).
6. Org-wide rollout of the statutory spine; publish Gap Contract v1 for M06/M08.
7. **Phase 2 (gated on curation evidence + flags):** weighted gap scoring, recommendations, marketplace, CPD targets.
8. Post-launch: monitor SR posting success, campaign coverage, nomination throughput, sync health, incremental-gap latency.

### 14.3 Rollback & safety
- Idempotent imports/batch jobs re-runnable; SR back-posting gated behind explicit approval.
- Feature flags per developmental capability (§2.5); flags default OFF.
- Append-only ledgers (incl. credential verifications, retention actions) ensure no destructive migration of historical evidence.
- Campaign jobs resumable; partial failures do not duplicate (idempotency keys).

| **3 (statutory spine — pilot)** | 009, 017 (campaign), 010+022 (attendance incl. kiosk/offline), 012, 016 (SR posting) | **Prove mandatory-compliance → cert → SR end-to-end on one department first** |
| 4 | 003 (inventory+freshness), 005, 006 | Inventory, needs, plan |
| 5 | 004 (incremental gap), 024 (Gap Contract), 011, 013, 018 | Gap engine + contract + assessment + induction + external creds |

## 16. Glossary & Appendices

### 16.1 Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Competency | A cluster of related skills/behaviours required for effective role performance. |
| Skill | An atomic, assessable capability within the taxonomy. |
| Proficiency level | An ordered measure of capability depth, each with a concrete behavioural anchor. |
| Competency model | The set of competencies + target proficiencies a role/cadre requires, with owner + review cadence. |
| Skill gap | The positive difference between required and current proficiency. |
| Skill freshness / staleness | Whether a validated skill is within its `revalidation_interval_months`; stale skills are discounted from gap closure. |
| Gap Contract | The versioned read-only projection of gaps consumed by M06/M08. |
| Campaign | A scoped, bulk, wave-orchestrated mandatory-training drive with rolling renewal and escalation. |
| Coverage denominator | The eligible population against which campaign completion % is measured. |
| Kirkpatrick model | Four-level evaluation: Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, Results (L3/L4 optional/sampled/programme-level). |
| CPD | Continuing Professional Development credits earned through learning. |
| SCORM / xAPI | E-learning standards; SCORM has no server push (poll the LMS reporting API); xAPI emits statements to an LRS. |
| LRS (Learning Record Store) | The store/endpoint that receives and serves xAPI statements; one is the primary system of record. |
| Content package | A versioned SCORM/xAPI/self-hosted e-learning asset with accessibility metadata. |
| Empanelment | Approved registration of an external vendor/trainer with contract/procurement reference. |
| Service bond | A post-sponsorship service-obligation period whose breach triggers cost recovery. |
| Learning path | An ordered sequence of programs toward a competency/role goal. |
| Skills marketplace | Internal directory (Phase 2, opt-in) matching surplus skills to mentoring/project needs. |
| Service Register (SR) | Statutory append-only service record ledger (M12). |
| `is_significant` rule set | The configurable rules deciding which trainings/credentials post to the SR. |
| Mandatory/compliance training | Legally/policy-required training with currency, renewal, and campaign orchestration. |
| Induction | Structured onboarding training for new entrants. |
| Maker-checker | Segregation-of-duties control: creator ≠ approver. |
| Kiosk/assisted mode | Attributed capture of learning actions for non-login staff. |
| DPDP erasure | Retention/erasure of learning PII at employee exit, honouring statutory overrides. |

### 16.2 Appendices
- **A. Default proficiency scale (with anchors):** L1 Awareness, L2 Working, L3 Proficient, L4 Advanced, L5 Expert — each `proficiency_levels.descriptor` carries a concrete behavioural anchor (mandatory, FR-TSD-001).
- **B. Default thresholds (configurable):** min attendance 80%; assessment pass 50%; renewal reminders 60/30/7 days; induction windows 30/60/90 days; budget alert ≥90%; **skill revalidation interval default 24 months; competency-model review cadence 12 months; campaign escalation T-14/T-3/T+1 days (v2)**.
- **C. Kirkpatrick capture model (v2, reframed):** L1 (relevance, trainer, materials, logistics, overall) per participant; L2 (pre/post score) per participant; **L3 (behaviour) and L4 (results) are optional, sampled, programme-level — NOT per-employee T+90**; L4 `responses_json` links named M14 business-KPI keys to enable cost-per-outcome. The fictional per-employee T+90 survey from v1 is removed.
- **D. `is_significant` rule set (v2 — promoted into FR-TSD-016, no longer an appendix afterthought):** a completion/credential is significant if ANY of: mandatory certification; externally accredited/professional credential (verified); programme duration ≥ configured threshold; promotion-relevant flag (M06); sponsored degree/deputation. Rules are configurable and the matched rule(s) stored for audit.
- **E. Single-LMS-of-record decision (v2):** exactly one `learning_record_stores` is `is_primary`; xAPI via LRS ingest, SCORM via reporting-API poll, optional self-hosted SCORM player. No SCORM webhook is assumed anywhere.
- **F. Inherited shared definitions:** see `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` §2–§5 (entities, conventions, roles, technical defaults). Not redefined here.
