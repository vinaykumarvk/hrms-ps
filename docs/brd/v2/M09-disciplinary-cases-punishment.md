# Employee Disciplinary Cases and Punishment Management — HRMS Module BRD (v2.0)

**Module code:** M09-DCP
**Program:** Enterprise HRMS ("PeopleGov / HRMS Suite")
**Document version:** v2.0 (revised; supersedes v1.0)
**Status:** Baseline for build — legality layer hardened per Council Report
**Authoring standard:** World-class global HCM (Workday / SAP SuccessFactors / Oracle HCM) layered on public-sector statutory due-process (CCS (CCA) Rules 1965, Article 311 of the Constitution, CVC/UPSC consultation regime, CCS (Pension) Rule 9, POSH Act 2013).
**Shared contract:** This BRD consumes and does **not** redefine the canonical entities, roles, conventions, and technical defaults in [`SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`](../SHARED_FOUNDATION.md).
**Revision basis:** Adversarial Council Report `/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/evaluation/M09-disciplinary-cases-punishment-council.md` — all 24 Adopted Improvements and every High/Critical Risk Register item incorporated (see §1.6 Amendments).

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Employee Disciplinary Cases and Punishment Management module (**M09-DCP**) digitises the **end-to-end disciplinary lifecycle** of a public-sector / enterprise employer, from the first receipt of a complaint or detection of misconduct through preliminary inquiry, optional suspension, framing of articles of charge, departmental inquiry, penalty imposition, and statutory appeal / revision / review — concluding with an immutable posting of the outcome (punishment **or** exoneration) into the Digital Service Register (M12).

The module exists to guarantee that **every** disciplinary proceeding satisfies the **principles of natural justice** (audi alteram partem — the right to be heard; nemo judex in causa sua — no one a judge in their own cause), is conducted by an **authority competent to impose the penalty**, observes **mandatory external consultation** (UPSC/CVC/ICC) where the regime requires it, respects **statutory timelines** (with lawful clock-pauses), preserves a **cryptographically tamper-evident audit trail**, and produces **legally and digitally signed** orders that withstand departmental appeal and judicial review.

### 1.2 Business context

Disciplinary action against a employee is a **quasi-judicial** process. A procedural defect — a denied opportunity to defend, an inquiry officer who is also a witness, a charge-sheet served after a barred period, a penalty exceeding what was proposed in the show-cause, **an order signed by an authority not competent to impose it (Article 311(1)), or a final order passed without mandatory UPSC/CVC consultation** — routinely results in penalty orders being set aside on appeal or by tribunals/courts, with consequential financial liability (back-wages, restoration of seniority, pension re-computation). Today these cases are run on paper files that are slow, opaque, prone to loss, and impossible to audit at scale.

M09-DCP converts this risk-laden manual process into a **controlled, time-bound, fully audited, two-layer workflow** — an **invariant natural-justice kernel** (charge → genuine opportunity to defend → reasoned finding on evidence → proportionate penalty within what was proposed, by a competent authority → independent appeal) wrapped in a **configurable jurisdiction overlay** (`procedure_template`: required consultations, authority-competence matrix, statutory timelines, valid service modes, appeal limitation, dispense-with-inquiry conditions). Seed reference data ships the CCS(CCA) regime as the default; a corporate code of conduct or a foreign-subsidiary regime is simply a different template.

### 1.3 Module objectives

| # | Objective | Measure of success |
|---|-----------|--------------------|
| O1 | Enforce due process and natural justice at every transition | 100% of penalty orders carry a complete, sequential, hash-chained audit chain; 0 stage-skips |
| O2 | Track statutory and internal SLAs per stage with lawful pause/resume | Real-time SLA dashboard; escalation on breach; ≥ 95% of stages closed within SLA; 0 false breaches on stayed/remitted cases |
| O3 | Guarantee confidentiality and integrity of case records | Field-level RBAC, sealed evidence vault, cryptographically chained immutable audit on every action |
| O4 | Produce legally defensible, competently-signed orders | Each penalty order traces to valid legal service, recorded defence, inquiry finding (or lawful dispensation), show-cause (major), **competent authority**, **completed mandatory consultation**, **proportionality reasoning**, and a **DSC/eSign signature** |
| O5 | Propagate outcomes to dependent modules accurately and idempotently | Penalty/exoneration posted exactly-once to M12 SR; effects flowed to M06/M10/M11; 0 duplicate downstream effects |
| O6 | Provide case analytics, vigilance oversight & proportionality review | Caseload, ageing, penalty-mix, appeal-overturn, vigilance-clearance, and penalty-proportionality-outlier dashboards |
| O7 | Serve a configurable, global + public-sector mandate | Same engine runs CCS(CCA), POSH/ICC, and corporate templates by swapping overlay reference data — no code fork |

### 1.4 Scope summary

In scope: complaint intake, preliminary inquiry, suspension & subsistence allowance (with non-employment-certificate gate and Ajay-Kumar-Choudhary deemed review), charge-sheet (articles of charge / statement of imputations), statement of defence, **document/witness list supply and inspection**, appointment of Inquiry Officer (IO) & Presenting Officer (PO), **POSH Internal Committee route**, conduct of departmental inquiry (witnesses, exhibits, daily order sheets, ex-parte, **criminal-parallel STAY**), **lawful dispense-with-inquiry path**, inquiry report & findings, disagreement memo, **mandatory external consultation (UPSC/CVC/ICC/legal)**, **authority-competence verification**, minor/major penalty determination, show-cause on proposed penalty, **personal hearing**, penalty order & exoneration (**with proportionality reasoning, recovery caps, and digital signing**), appeal / revision / review, SR posting and downstream effects (idempotent), evidence vault, integrity register, vigilance clearance, **mid-proceeding jurisdiction transfer / sealed-cover / retiree proceedings**, **abatement on death**, SLA tracking with **pause/resume**, **court-grade hash-chained audit**, **procedure-template configuration**, and analytics.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere, integrated here): the SR ledger itself (M12), payroll execution of recoveries/subsistence (M10), pension re-computation engine (M11), seniority list recomputation (M06), the physical document store (M13), identity/SSO and the DSC/eSign trust service (platform), and external court/police case systems (reference-linked only).

### 1.5 Key outcomes

A complete, confidential, time-bound, audit-grade, **competence- and consultation-gated**, **digitally signed** disciplinary case system, configurable across jurisdictions, that an enterprise/enterprise HR organisation can rely on for **defensible** penalty orders that withstand judicial review, **transparent** ageing, and **accurate, exactly-once** downstream propagation of consequences.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited, applied module-wide)

- **Maker-checker / workflow engine** (`workflow_instances` / `workflow_tasks`) for every stage transition that changes statutory state.
- **Segregation of duties (extended):** maker ≠ checker; the Disciplinary Authority (DA), Inquiry Officer (IO), Presenting Officer (PO), and any witness must be **mutually distinct** persons; **the DA may not also be the complainant or a witness** (DI-2, nemo judex in causa sua); no self-approval.
- **Two-layer procedure model:** an invariant natural-justice **kernel** plus a configurable **`procedure_template`** overlay; the kernel is never parameterised away (DI-17).
- **Competence & consultation gating:** finalise is blocked unless the signing authority is competent for the penalty class (DI-13) and all template-required consultations are closed (DI-14).
- **Cryptographically tamper-evident audit** (`audit_log` + hash-chained `case_timeline_events`) on every create/update/transition/view-of-sealed-record (DI-21).
- **Legal service ≠ notification:** statutory service is recorded in `legal_service_records` with proof; the `notifications` ledger is informational only (DI-15).
- **Digital signing:** statutory artefacts carry DSC/eSign signature metadata (DI-28).
- **Document handling** via M13 (`documents`) — versioned, encrypted, access-controlled objects referenced by metadata.
- **Notifications** via shared `notifications` ledger (in-app + email + optional SMS).
- **Idempotency:** state-changing propagating posts are deduplicated through `idempotency_keys` with a defined TTL (DI-19).
- **Pagination** on all list endpoints (page/limit, hard max 100).
- **Localisation:** UTC storage, `DD-MMM-YYYY` display, INR money formatting.
- **RBAC + row-level org scoping**, extended in §3 with field-level confidentiality controls.

### 2.3 Boundaries & integration points

| Boundary | Direction | Contract |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| M01-EPM (employees) | read | Charged employee(s), complainant, IO/PO identity, designation, cadre, org_unit, employment_status |
| M05-TRJ (transfers) | read (event) | Mid-proceeding transfer triggers jurisdiction re-resolution (FR-026) |
| M06-PPP | write (event) + read | Reduction in rank, withholding of promotion, seniority re-fixation; **sealed-cover** promotion freeze |
| M10-PAY | write (event) | Suspension → subsistence (NEC-gated); recovery (capped); pay reduction; promotion/increment withholding |
| M11-PEN | write (event) | Pension cut/withholding; effect of removal/dismissal/CR; retiree-proceeding flags; Rule 9 |
| M12-SR (service_register_events) | write (append-only, idempotent) | Suspension, penalty, exoneration, appeal outcome, abatement events |
| M13-DMS | read/write | Evidence vault objects, charge-sheet/order PDFs (DSC-signed) |
| M14-DAS | read | KPI feed incl. proportionality-outlier dashboard |
| Platform DSC/eSign trust service | call | Sign + verify trusted timestamp and signatory identity binding |
| Platform | read | Auth/SSO/MFA, roles, org tree |

### 2.4 Explicit non-goals

- M09 does **not** compute payroll, pension, or seniority figures; it emits **events** that the owning module executes.
- M09 does **not** store document binaries; it stores references to M13 objects.
- M09 does **not** operate the DSC/eSign Certifying Authority; it calls the platform trust service and stores returned signature metadata.
- Criminal prosecution case management (police/court FIR tracking) is **linked** (reference fields) and can **STAY** an inquiry, but is not executed here.
- M09 is **not** a generic BPM designer; configurability is **capped** at the named overlay items in `procedure_templates` (DI-17).

### 3.3 Field-level confidentiality rules

- The **charged officer** may read **only** artefacts that have been **formally served** (via `legal_service_records`) on them (charge-sheet, inquiry report copy, show-cause, orders) and never the preliminary inquiry report, vigilance notes, sealed-cover contents, or DA's internal deliberation — **except** any PI/sealed material **relied upon as evidence** in the inquiry, which **must** be disclosed (DI-9 extended; `relied_upon=true ⇒ disclosed=true`).
- **Complainant identity** is masked from the charged officer unless the case type mandates disclosure; whistle-blower protection flag (`is_confidential_source`) hard-hides identity from all roles except Vigilance Officer and DA.
- IO/PO/ICC cannot view the **vigilance register** scoring, the DA's draft penalty reasoning, or **sealed-cover** promotion contents.
- All reads of sealed/confidential records are logged with hash-chained `view` audit events (read-audit).
- Consultation advice (UPSC/CVC) is restricted to DA, Vigilance, Consulting-Authority Liaison and Auditor; not served on the charged officer unless relied upon as the basis for the penalty.

## 4. Shared Application Foundation

This module **inherits** §5 of `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` in full:

- **Architecture:** React + TypeScript (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) SPA; REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL; encrypted object storage (M13) for binaries; deployed at CGG Data Centre.
- **Auth:** OIDC/SSO + MFA; JWT access tokens; RBAC + row-level org scoping; **plus** field-level confidentiality (§3.3), **step-up MFA** for penalty/appeal decisions, and **DSC/eSign** for statutory signing.
- **Canonical error envelope:** `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "field": "..." }, "requestId": "..." }`.
- **Standard error codes:** VALIDATION_ERROR(400), AUTH_REQUIRED(401), FORBIDDEN(403), NOT_FOUND(404), CONFLICT(409), RATE_LIMITED(429), INTERNAL_ERROR(500), UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE(503); module-specific codes in §10.
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP ASVS, TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest, full hash-chained audit trail, DPDP Act 2023 alignment, statutory retention.
- **NFR baseline:** P95 API < 500 ms; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15 min, RTO ≤ 4h.

**Reused canonical entities (referenced, not redefined):** `employees`, `users`, `org_units`, `designations`/`cadres`/`pay_scales`, `roles`/`permissions`, `service_register_events` (M12), `documents` (M13), `notifications`, `audit_log`, `workflow_instances` / `workflow_tasks`.

**Two-layer design principle (binding):** the natural-justice **kernel** — (1) notice of charge by valid service, (2) genuine opportunity to defend incl. document/witness inspection, (3) reasoned finding on recorded evidence, (4) penalty **proportionate** and **not exceeding** what was put to the person, **by a competent authority**, after **mandatory consultation**, (5) independent appeal — is enforced in code and is **non-configurable**. The **overlay** (`procedure_templates`, `authority_competence`) is reference data. No generic workflow designer is built (anti-over-engineering cap, DI-17).

### 5.6 Data integrity rules

1. **DI-1 Stage monotonicity:** `case_stage` may only advance along the state machine (§12); regression requires a `REMITTED`/`DE_NOVO`/appeal/jurisdiction-transfer event with recorded authority.
2. **DI-2 Distinct actors (extended, AI-23):** for a given `case_id`, the persons holding DA, IO, PO, and each witness must be **mutually distinct**; **the DA must not also be the complainant or a witness** on the same case (nemo judex in causa sua); a charged respondent can never be IO/PO/DA on their own case. DB constraint + service check.
3. **DI-3 No penalty without process:** a `penalty_orders` row of `order_type=PENALTY` requires valid legal service of a `charge_sheet`, a `defence_statements` row (or `is_ex_parte_assumed=true`), and — for `penalty_class=MAJOR` — a concluded `inquiry_reports` **or an approved `inquiry_dispensations`** (DI-23) and a responded/closed `show_cause_notices`.
4. **DI-4 Show-cause ⊇ order:** penalties in a finalised order must be a **subset** of the penalties proposed in the related show-cause (no enhancement beyond proposed without fresh show-cause).
5. **DI-5 Limitation guard:** `appeals.is_time_barred` is computed from `limitation_due_date` (per template); a time-barred appeal can be `ADMITTED` only if `condonation_granted=true`.
6. **DI-6 Immutability after finalise:** once `penalty_orders.status` ∈ {FINALISED, SERVED}, the order and its `penalty_items` are read-only; changes only via appeal/revision producing a new `revised_order_id`.
7. **DI-7 Evidence seal:** every `inquiry_exhibits`/`case_documents` row stores `content_hash`; mismatch on read raises `EVIDENCE_TAMPERED`.
8. **DI-8 Subsistence floor/ceiling:** `subsistence_rate_pct` ∈ [template floor, ceiling] (default [25, 75]); must be reviewed before `subsistence_revision_due`.
9. **DI-9 Confidentiality (extended, AI-24):** rows with `is_confidential_source=true` never expose complainant identity outside Vigilance Officer/DA. **However, any PI/sealed/consultation material `relied_upon=true` as evidence MUST be disclosed to the charged officer (`disclosed_to_charged=true`)** before a finding can rest on it; violation raises `NATURAL_JUSTICE_VIOLATION`.
10. **DI-10 SR posting once:** at most one non-superseded `service_register_events` per finalised order; supersession only via appeal outcome.
11. **DI-11 Referential integrity:** all FKs enforced; soft-deleted parents block new children.
12. **DI-12 Append-only ledgers:** `case_timeline_events`, `sla_pause_events`, and `audit_log` are insert-only; no update/delete.
13. **DI-13 Penalty competence (v2, AI-1, R1):** finalising any `penalty_items` row requires `passed_by` to be competent for that penalty class/type per `authority_competence` for the respondent's cadre. For DISMISSAL/REMOVAL/CR, the authority must **not be subordinate to the appointing authority** (Art. 311(1)). Otherwise return `AUTHORITY_NOT_COMPETENT` (409) and refuse persistence. `competence_verified` must be true to finalise.
14. **DI-14 Mandatory consultation (v2, AI-2, R2):** finalise is blocked until every `case_consultations` row that the case's `procedure_template` marks mandatory is `CLOSED` (or `WAIVED` with reasons). Otherwise `CONSULTATION_PENDING` (409).
15. **DI-15 Legal service validity (v2, AI-5, R5):** statutory reply windows and downstream deadlines compute **only** from a `legal_service_records` row whose `is_statutorily_valid=true` (mode ∈ template `valid_service_modes_json`). EMAIL is non-statutory by default. Informational `notifications` never constitute service.
16. **DI-16 Subsistence correctness (v2, AI-6, R6):** a subsistence payment event to M10 requires `non_employment_certificate_received=true`. If a charge-memo is not validly served by `charge_memo_due_date` (90-day window), set `deemed_review_flag=true` and escalate for review/possible revocation.
17. **DI-17 Kernel invariance (v2, AI-8, R8):** the natural-justice kernel (DI-2/3/4/9/13/14/20) is enforced for **all** templates and cannot be parameterised away; `procedure_templates` may only configure the named overlay items. No generic BPM/rules designer.
18. **DI-18 SLA pause/resume integrity (v2, AI-10, R10):** while an open `sla_pause_events` row exists for a stage, that stage's `sla_status=PAUSED` and no breach is raised; on resume, `sla_target_at`/`expected_closure_date` are recomputed by adding the paused duration.
19. **DI-19 Idempotency dedup (v2, AI-11, R11):** a propagating post (SUSPENSION, ORDER_FINALISE, POST_TO_SR, APPEAL_DECIDE) with a previously-seen `idempotency_key` + matching fingerprint returns the stored result and produces **no** second effect; mismatching fingerprint on a seen key returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` (409). Keys expire per TTL.
20. **DI-20 Proportionality reasoning (v2, AI-12, R12):** a `PENALTY` order cannot be finalised unless `proportionality_reasoning` is non-empty; analytics flags outliers (penalty severity vs misconduct/precedent).
21. **DI-21 Hash-chained audit (v2, AI-15, R15):** each `case_timeline_events` row stores `prev_hash` (prior row's `row_hash`) and a computed `row_hash`; the verify endpoint recomputes the chain and raises `AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN` on any mismatch.
22. **DI-22 Recovery caps (v2, AI-20, R20):** for RECOVERY/FINE items, monthly deduction ≤ `recovery_monthly_cap_pct` (default 1/3 of pay), instalments bounded, and no recovery beyond retirement except from DCRG (`recovery_beyond_retirement` ⇒ DCRG source); violation `RECOVERY_CAP_EXCEEDED` (422).
23. **DI-23 Dispensation guard (v2, AI-3, R3):** a penalty without an inquiry is lawful only if an `inquiry_dispensations` row is `APPROVED` with a valid `reason_code` permitted by the template and recorded speaking reasons; else `DUE_PROCESS_INCOMPLETE`.
24. **DI-24 Inspection afforded (v2, AI-4, R4):** an inquiry cannot record substantive evidence (witness examination/exhibit admission) unless `list_supplied_date` and `inspection_afforded_date` are set; else `INSPECTION_NOT_AFFORDED` (409).
25. **DI-25 Multi-respondent consistency (v2, AI-7, R7):** in common proceedings, every `case_respondents` row gets article-wise findings; an order/exoneration must exist per ACTIVE respondent before the case closes; severance (`SEVERED`) requires recorded reasons.
26. **DI-26 Abatement terminal (v2, AI-14, R14):** on charged-officer death, the case/respondent moves to `ABATED`; SLAs stop, downstream penalty effects are suppressed, and no further penalty order may be finalised for that respondent.
27. **DI-27 Retiree proceedings (v2, AI-13, R13):** proceedings against a retired employee require `is_retiree_case=true`, a recorded `retiree_sanction_ref`, and must respect the Rule 9 **four-year** event bar; failing the bar/sanction returns `RETIREE_PROCEEDING_BARRED` (409).
28. **DI-28 Digital signing (v2, AI-17, R17):** charge-sheets, inquiry reports, show-cause notices, and orders cannot reach a served/finalised state without `signature_type` ∈ {DSC, ESIGN}, a bound `signatory_id`, and `signed_at`; else `SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` (422).
29. **DI-29 Personal-hearing record (v2, AI-21):** where a personal hearing is requested at SHOW_CAUSE/APPEAL, a `personal_hearings` row must record grant/denial; denial requires `denial_reason`; an order/appeal decision references the hearing where held.

### FR-M09-001 — Complaint / Source-of-Misconduct Registration & Triage

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Complainant, Vigilance Officer, DCP Admin, Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As a Vigilance Officer, I want to register and triage every complaint or detected source of misconduct so that only substantiated matters proceed to a formal case while all sources remain auditable.

**Description:** Captures complaints from internal, public, anonymous, audit, media, CVC, or suo-motu sources, deduplicates against existing cases for the same subject, and supports a triage decision (file case / order preliminary inquiry / close with no action / transfer to another agency). On `FILE_CASE`, the correct **`procedure_template`** is resolved (by jurisdiction + misconduct; HARASSMENT ⇒ POSH/ICC) and the **competent DA** is resolved and competence-checked. Anonymous and whistle-blower sources are handled with identity protection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A complaint can be registered with a unique `complaint_no`, mandatory `allegation_summary` and `subject_employee_id` (or external subject reference).
2. Anonymous complaints are accepted with `complainant_id` null and `is_anonymous=true`; whistle-blower flag hides identity per DI-9.
3. The system surfaces existing open cases/complaints for the same subject before allowing a new case (duplicate guard).
4. Triage records a `triage_decision`, `triaged_by`, `triaged_at`, and remarks; `FILE_CASE` creates a `disciplinary_cases` row in `OPEN`/`INTAKE`, resolves and stamps `procedure_template_id` and `jurisdiction_code` **(v2)**, and creates the primary `case_respondents` row **(v2)**.
5. **(v2)** On `FILE_CASE` the resolved DA must not be the complainant or a witness (DI-2); HARASSMENT sets `is_posh_case=true` and selects the ICC template.
6. Every action writes to hash-chained `audit_log` and a `case_timeline_events` entry once a case exists.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Only Vigilance Officer or DA may set `triage_decision`.
- BR-2: `CLOSE_NO_ACTION` requires remarks and DA concurrence for vigilance-flagged complaints.
- BR-3: Promotion to a case requires a competent `disciplinary_authority_id` resolvable from org hierarchy and `authority_competence`.
- BR-4 **(v2):** Template resolution is mandatory; if no template matches jurisdiction+misconduct, `PROCEDURE_TEMPLATE_INVALID` (422).

| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/complaints/{id}/triage` | Triage decision (resolves template + DA) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Intake form with source-type selector; anonymous toggle hides complainant fields; a live "existing matters for this employee" panel; triage drawer with decision radio + remarks; **(v2)** auto-resolved template + DA shown with competence badge before confirm.

**Edge Cases:** Subject is a non-employee/contractor (external subject ref); subject already retired (route to retiree-proceeding path FR-026, M11 advisory); same allegation re-submitted (merge); **(v2)** DA resolves to the complainant ⇒ block with `DA_BIAS_CONFLICT`; HARASSMENT routes to ICC template.

### FR-M09-002 — Preliminary (Fact-Finding) Inquiry

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, Vigilance Officer, PI Officer, DCP Admin

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to order a preliminary inquiry so that I can decide, on facts, whether formal charges are warranted and on which track.

**Description:** Orders a confidential fact-finding inquiry, assigns a PI officer, tracks an SLA, and records findings with a recommendation. The PI report is confidential and **normally** not served — **but any PI material later relied upon as evidence in the inquiry must be disclosed to the charged officer (`relied_upon ⇒ disclosed`, DI-9, AI-24)**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. DA/Vigilance can order a PI with `pi_officer_id`, `ordered_date`, and `due_date`.
2. PI status transitions ORDERED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → CLOSED.
3. On submission a `recommendation` and confidential `report_document_id` are required.
4. PI report is stored with `is_served=false` and excluded from the charged officer's view (DI-9/§3.3).
5. **(v2)** If PI material is marked `relied_upon=true` as an exhibit, the system forces `disclosed_to_charged=true` before any finding can rest on it; `contains_relied_material` is set on the PI.
6. SLA breach raises a timeline `SLA_BREACH` + escalation notification.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: PI officer ≠ subject; PI officer should not later be IO on the same case (warn + override-with-reason).
- BR-2: `DROP` recommendation requires DA approval and closes the case with `DROPPED` if no charges.
- BR-3: PI is optional for clear-cut minor matters (skippable to charge).
- BR-4 **(v2):** PI material relied upon but not disclosed blocks finding (`NATURAL_JUSTICE_VIOLATION`).

### FR-M09-003 — Suspension (Parallel Status), Subsistence Allowance & Review

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin, Payroll Officer (downstream)

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to place an employee under suspension (or record deemed suspension) and manage subsistence allowance so that interim action is lawful, payroll-correct, periodically reviewed, and does not stall the main proceeding.

**Description:** **(v2)** Suspension is modelled as a **parallel interim status** on the case (`is_under_suspension`/`suspension_status`), **not a linear stage** — the charge/inquiry track proceeds concurrently. Issues suspension orders (ordered/deemed/continued), sets subsistence within statutory bounds, **gates the subsistence payment event on a non-employment certificate (DI-16)**, schedules mandatory periodic review, **auto-flags a deemed review when the charge-memo is not served within the 90-day window (Ajay Kumar Choudhary, DI-16)**, emits a payroll event to M10, and supports revocation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A suspension order sets `effective_from`, `subsistence_rate_pct` ∈ [template floor, ceiling], sets case `is_under_suspension=true` (parallel) **(v2)**, and updates `employees.employment_status=SUSPENDED` via M01 event.
2. Deemed suspension auto-creates a record when detention > 48h is recorded.
3. **(v2)** The subsistence payment event to M10 is emitted **only** when `non_employment_certificate_received=true`; otherwise the payment is held and flagged.
4. A subsistence review task is scheduled before `subsistence_revision_due` (default 90 days) and a review-board task before `review_committee_due` (default 180 days).
5. **(v2)** If a valid charge-memo is not served by `charge_memo_due_date` (90 days), set `deemed_review_flag=true`, raise escalation, and surface auto-revocation review.
6. Revocation sets `status=REVOKED`, `effective_to`, and emits M10 + M01 events; an SR event is appended for suspension and revocation (FR-013).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Subsistence rate revision blocked outside [floor, ceiling] (DI-8).
- BR-2: Suspension during inquiry cannot exceed configured limit without documented extension.
- BR-3: Period-of-suspension treatment decided at final order, not at revocation.
- BR-4 **(v2):** No subsistence disbursement without NEC (DI-16).

### FR-M09-004 — Charge-Sheet / Articles of Charge (Statement of Imputations)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin, Presenting Officer (draft)

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to frame and serve a digitally-signed charge-sheet with distinct articles of charge so that each charged officer knows precisely what they must answer.

**Description:** Builds a memorandum of charges with one or more articles; selects penalty track; **generates a DSC/eSign-signed PDF (M13, DI-28)**; records **valid legal service via `legal_service_records` (DI-15)** with mode and computes the statutory defence-reply window from the valid-service date. **(v2)** In common proceedings, the charge-sheet maps to multiple `case_respondents`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A charge-sheet requires at least one `charge_articles` row; each article requires text, imputation, and rule.
2. Penalty track (MINOR/MAJOR) determines downstream path.
3. **(v2)** On issue, a **DSC/eSign-signed** PDF is produced (`signature_type`, `signatory_id`, `signed_at`); without a signature the sheet cannot be served (`SIGNATURE_REQUIRED`).
4. **(v2)** Service is recorded as a `legal_service_records` row; `defence_due_date` computes **only** from a `is_statutorily_valid=true` service (EMAIL non-statutory by default); invalid mode ⇒ `INVALID_SERVICE_MODE`.
5. The served charge-sheet is visible to the charged officer (`is_served=true`).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: A charge-sheet cannot be served before active suspension review obligations are satisfied (warn-only).
- BR-2: Withdrawal requires reason and DA approval; a withdrawn sheet cannot host an inquiry.
- BR-3: Articles uniquely numbered and immutable after service (amendment ⇒ supplementary charge-sheet).
- BR-4 **(v2):** Valid service mode must be in the template `valid_service_modes_json`.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `charge_sheets` | create/issue/serve (+ signature) |
| `charge_articles` | articles |
| `legal_service_records` | valid service **(v2)** |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Article builder (repeatable rows), rule-violated lookup, track selector, PDF preview, **(v2)** sign-with-DSC/eSign step, service-recording panel showing only template-valid modes and an EMAIL "non-statutory" warning, auto-computed reply due-date.

**Edge Cases:** Substituted/published service when employee absconds; supplementary charges after inquiry begins (de novo/addendum); multilingual charge-sheet; **(v2)** attempt to serve unsigned sheet ⇒ blocked; EMAIL chosen where not permitted ⇒ blocked.

### FR-M09-005 — Employee's Written Statement of Defence (+ Rights & Deadlines Surface)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Charged Officer), DCP Admin

**User Story:** As a charged officer, I want to submit my statement of defence and clearly see my entitlements and deadlines so that my side is on record and I can exercise my rights.

**Description:** Self-service submission of the defence (plea, statement, requests for oral inquiry, defence assistant, **personal hearing**). **(v2)** The Charged-Officer Portal is upgraded to a **rights-and-deadlines surface**: it shows entitlements (defence assistant, document/witness inspection, personal hearing, appeal limitation countdown) and statutory deadlines — not just a served-document list (AI-19). If no response within the valid window, an ex-parte assumption is recorded.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The charged officer can submit a defence against a **validly served** charge-sheet before `defence_due_date`.
2. Plea selection is mandatory; partial admissions can be article-wise.
3. Requesting an oral inquiry forces the major-track inquiry path (escalation logged).
4. If `defence_due_date` passes with no submission, `is_ex_parte_assumed=true` is set automatically.
5. An extension request routes to DA for approval and, if granted, updates `defence_due_date`.
6. **(v2)** The portal renders a rights panel and a live limitation/deadline countdown; requesting a personal hearing records `requests_personal_hearing=true` (feeds FR-025).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Defence editable until submitted; immutable thereafter (corrigendum via new statement).
- BR-2: ADMITS_ALL on minor track allows DA to proceed directly to penalty without inquiry (still a speaking, signed order).
- BR-3: Only the charged officer (or authorised assistant) may submit.

**UI Behavior Notes:** Charged-officer portal showing only served documents; **(v2)** a **Rights & Deadlines** panel (entitlements + countdowns), plea radio per article, statement editor, checkboxes for oral inquiry / defence assistant / personal hearing; locked after submit.

**Edge Cases:** Employee on leave/hospitalised (extension); ex-parte then late submission (DA discretion); employee disputes valid service (objection record referencing `legal_service_records`).

### FR-M09-006 — Appointment of Inquiry Officer & Presenting Officer (or ICC Constitution)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to appoint an impartial Inquiry Officer and Presenting Officer (or constitute a POSH Internal Committee) so that the inquiry is conducted fairly and at arm's length.

**Description:** Appoints IO and PO (ORDINARY_IO route) or **constitutes an ICC (ICC_POSH route) for HARASSMENT cases (AI-16)** with mandated composition (presiding officer, members, **external member**), enforcing distinct-actor and conflict-of-interest rules (DI-2, incl. DA ≠ complainant/witness), supports recusal/objection/replacement, and permits a defence assistant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. IO, PO, DA, complainant, witnesses, and the charged officer must be mutually distinct (DI-2); violations blocked with `ACTOR_CONFLICT`.
2. The charged officer may raise a bias objection against the IO; the DA records a reasoned decision (uphold ⇒ replace).
3. Replacement preserves appointment history (old row `REPLACED`, new row `ACTIVE`).
4. A defence assistant nomination is recorded subject to eligibility rules.
5. **(v2)** For `is_posh_case`, the system enforces ICC composition (≥1 `ICC_EXTERNAL_MEMBER`, a presiding officer); missing composition ⇒ `ICC_PROCEDURE_REQUIRED`.
6. Appointment notifications are sent to all parties.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: IO should not have been the PI officer or a witness (hard block on witness; warn on PI officer).
- BR-2: External IO/ICC external member permitted/required per template.
- BR-3: At most one ACTIVE IO and one ACTIVE PO per ordinary inquiry; ICC has exactly one presiding officer.

### FR-M09-007 — Conduct of Departmental Inquiry (Hearings, Witnesses, Exhibits, Inspection, Ex-Parte, Stay)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Inquiry Officer / ICC, Presenting Officer, Charged Officer / Defence Assistant

**User Story:** As an Inquiry Officer, I want to supply the document/witness list, afford inspection, schedule hearings, examine witnesses, admit exhibits, maintain daily order sheets, and (where a parallel criminal trial exists) stay the inquiry, so that it is complete, fair, and fully documented.

**Description:** Runs the oral inquiry. **(v2)** Before substantive evidence, the IO must **supply the list of relied-upon documents/witnesses and afford inspection (`list_supplied_date`, `inspection_afforded_date`; DI-24, AI-4)**. Manages witnesses, exhibits (sealed, hashed, **relied/disclosed flags**), daily order sheets, ex-parte after due notice, and **(v2)** a **STAYED** sub-state with automatic SLA pause when a criminal trial on the same facts is active (AI-18).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **(v2)** The IO records `list_supplied_date` and `inspection_afforded_date`; witness examination/exhibit admission is blocked until both are set (`INSPECTION_NOT_AFFORDED`).
2. The IO can schedule a hearing, record outcome, and a mandatory daily order text.
3. Witnesses (both sides) listed and depositions recorded with examination status; cross-examination opportunity afforded.
4. Exhibits added with marker, side, description, sealed reference, `content_hash` (DI-7), and **(v2)** `relied_upon`/`disclosed_to_charged` (DI-9).
5. Ex-parte: after configured no-shows with proof of notice, the IO may set the inquiry `EX_PARTE`.
6. **(v2)** When `criminal_case_ref` is active and prejudice is shown, the IO (with DA approval) sets `STAYED` with reason, creating an `sla_pause_events(CRIMINAL_STAY)`; resume lifts the pause.
7. Every action writes hash-chained `audit_log` and timeline.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Fair opportunity to cross-examine; ex-parte requires documented notice.
- BR-2: Exhibits cannot be deleted once admitted (only marked objected); seal immutable.
- BR-3: Hearing scheduling respects reasonable-notice config.
- BR-4 **(v2):** Evidence relied upon must be disclosed (DI-9); inspection must precede evidence (DI-24).

### FR-M09-008 — Inquiry Report & Findings

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Inquiry Officer / ICC, Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As an Inquiry Officer, I want to submit a reasoned, signed inquiry report with article-wise (per-respondent) findings so that the DA can decide on the evidence.

**Description:** The IO/ICC records **per-respondent, article-wise findings** (`findings_json`) with reasoning, an overall finding, and a **DSC/eSign-signed report (DI-28)**. A copy is **validly served (DI-15)** on each charged officer for representation before DA consideration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The IO must record a finding for **every** article **for every active respondent** before submitting (DI-25).
2. The report requires `analysis_text`, `findings_json`, and a **signed** `report_document_id` **(v2)**.
3. On submission the inquiry is `CONCLUDED` and the case moves to `DA_CONSIDERATION` (or `CONSULTATION` if mandatory consultation pending).
4. A copy of the report is validly served on each charged officer with a representation window.
5. Findings write back to the per-respondent finding grid.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: A report cannot be submitted for an inquiry not IN_PROGRESS/EX_PARTE.
- BR-2: Findings must be supported by recorded evidence (advisory completeness check).
- BR-3: The DA may remit for further inquiry (`REMITTED`) with reasons.

### FR-M09-009 — Disagreement Memo & Disciplinary Authority Consideration

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, Charged Officer

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, when I disagree with the IO's findings, I want to issue a disagreement memo and give the charged officer a chance to represent so that my differing view is procedurally valid.

**Description:** Records the DA's consideration; where the DA disagrees (especially upgrading not-proved to proved), a disagreement memo with tentative reasons is **validly served (DI-15)** on the charged officer, who may respond before finalisation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The DA can accept the report (→ consultation/show-cause/penalty path) or record a disagreement memo.
2. A disagreement memo requires `tentative_disagreement` and `articles_affected_json`.
3. The memo is served (legal service) with a representation window; response recorded.
4. Final consideration after representation moves the case forward (`FINALISED`).
5. Disagreement upgrading a finding to "proved" must be served before any penalty (natural justice).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: The DA cannot impose a penalty on a not-proved article without first serving a disagreement memo and considering the representation.
- BR-2: Memo immutable after serve.
- BR-3: Full agreement with not-proved on all articles ⇒ exoneration path (FR-011).

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to issue a show-cause notice setting out the penalty I propose so that the employee can represent (and seek a personal hearing) before I finalise it.

**Description:** Issues a show-cause notice with tentatively proposed penalty(ies) on the major track (or where enhancement is contemplated), records **valid service (DI-15)** and representation, **supports a personal hearing (FR-025, AI-21)**, and constrains the final order to the proposed set (DI-4).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A show-cause notice records `proposed_penalty_json`, issue/serve dates, and `response_due_date`.
2. The charged officer's representation is recorded (or `NO_RESPONSE` on lapse).
3. The final penalty order's penalties must be a subset of the proposed penalties (DI-4); enhancement requires fresh show-cause.
4. Major-track penalties cannot be finalised without a closed show-cause (DI-3).
5. **(v2)** A requested personal hearing is recorded in `personal_hearings`; denial requires reasons (DI-29).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Minor-penalty track does not require a separate show-cause (per config).
- BR-2: Proposed penalty must be a recognised `penalty_type` valid for the case.
- BR-3: Notice immutable after serve.

### FR-M09-011 — Penalty Order & Exoneration (Competence, Consultation, Proportionality, Recovery Caps, Signing)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want to pass a reasoned, proportionate, competently-signed final order so that the case concludes lawfully and withstands judicial review.

**Description:** Produces the final speaking order. **(v2)** Finalise is now gated by the full legality layer: **authority competence (DI-13)**, **mandatory consultation closed (DI-14)**, **proportionality reasoning (DI-20)**, **recovery caps (DI-22)**, and **DSC/eSign signing (DI-28)** — in addition to v1 due-process (DI-3) and subset (DI-4) checks. The order is finalised, validly served, made immutable (DI-6), and posted to the SR idempotently (FR-013).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. An order requires `reasoning_text`, `proportionality_reasoning` **(v2)**, and `is_speaking_order=true` to finalise.
2. Penalty order requires the full due-process chain (DI-3 — including lawful dispensation where applicable), subset constraint (DI-4), **competence verification (DI-13)**, and **closed mandatory consultations (DI-14)** **(v2)**.
3. Each `penalty_items` row sets type-appropriate parameters; **(v2)** RECOVERY/FINE items are validated against caps (DI-22).
4. **(v2)** The order is signed via DSC/eSign (`signature_type`, `signatory_id`, `signed_at`, `signature_ref`) before finalise; unsigned ⇒ `SIGNATURE_REQUIRED`.
5. On finalise, the order and items become read-only (DI-6); an idempotent SR posting is triggered (FR-013).
6. Exoneration sets case/respondent `EXONERATED`, restores `employment_status` (if suspended), clears vigilance status, and lifts sealed cover.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Major penalties (reduction/CR/removal/dismissal) require step-up MFA **and** competence verification (Art. 311(1)).
- BR-2: Penalty effective date defaults to service date unless lawfully retrospective with reasons.
- BR-3: Period-of-suspension treatment decided in this order.
- BR-4 **(v2):** Recovery beyond retirement only from DCRG; monthly recovery ≤ cap.

**Edge Cases:** Multiple penalties of different classes (competence resolved to the **highest** class); recovery exceeding cap (validation); exoneration after long suspension (back-pay settlement to M10); **(v2)** employee deceased before order ⇒ abate (FR-028); incompetent DA ⇒ block.

### FR-M09-012 — Appeal / Revision / Review

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Charged Officer, Appellate Authority, Reviewing/Revising Authority

**User Story:** As a penalised employee, I want to appeal within the statutory limitation; and as an appellate/reviewing authority, I want to decide the appeal so that errors are corrected and outcomes propagate.

**Description:** Manages post-order remedies — appeal, revision, suo-motu review — with limitation tracking (per template), condonation, **personal hearing (FR-025)**, decision recording, and generation of a revised order. **(v2)** Condonation creates an `sla_pause_events(CONDONATION)`; the appellate authority's competence is verified (DI-13); enhancement requires fresh show-cause.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. An appeal can be filed against a finalised/served order; `limitation_due_date` computed from the template (default 45 days).
2. Late appeals flagged `is_time_barred`; admission requires `condonation_granted=true` (creates SLA pause **(v2)**).
3. The authority records a decision with reasoning; `MODIFIED` creates a `revised_order_id`.
4. `ENHANCED` requires a fresh show-cause before finalisation (natural justice).
5. Decision propagates: SR supersession (FR-013) and downstream reversal/adjustment (M06/M10/M11).
6. **(v2)** Appellate authority ≠ DA and competence verified; personal hearing recorded where held.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Appeal authority ≠ DA who passed the order.
- BR-2: One pending appeal per order; revision/review may follow.
- BR-3: `SET_ASIDE` restores prior status and reverses downstream effects.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `appeals` | create/decide |
| `personal_hearings` | hearing **(v2)** |

| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/appeals/{id}/decide` | Record decision (`Idempotency-Key`) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Appeal-filing form with limitation indicator; authority decision screen with decision selector, **competence badge**, personal-hearing scheduler, revised-order link; enhancement triggers show-cause sub-flow.

**Edge Cases:** Time-barred without condonation (reject); enhancement without show-cause (block); multiple remedies in sequence; appeal pending while recovery deducted (hold/refund with M10).

### FR-M09-013 — Service Register Posting & Downstream Effects (Idempotent)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin, SR Custodian (M12)

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Authority, I want every concluded outcome posted exactly-once to the Digital SR and propagated to payroll, seniority, and pension so that the statutory record and entitlements are accurate with no duplicate effects.

**Description:** Appends an immutable SR event and emits idempotent effect events to M06/M10/M11. **(v2)** Uses the defined **`idempotency_keys` lifecycle (DI-19, AI-11)** — keys minted server-side per scope, deduplicated against a store with a TTL, guaranteeing exactly-once effects even on double-finalise / double post-to-SR. Outbox/retry for reliability; supersession on appeal.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On order finalise (and appeal decision), an SR event is appended with order reference (DI-10).
2. Penalty-type-specific downstream events are emitted (WITHHOLD_INCREMENT/REDUCTION → M06+M10; RECOVERY → M10; CR/REMOVAL/DISMISSAL → M11; WITHHOLD_PROMOTION → M06).
3. **(v2)** Emission is idempotent via `idempotency_keys`; a replayed key returns the stored result and produces no second effect; mismatched fingerprint on a seen key ⇒ `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.
4. Appeal `SET_ASIDE`/`MODIFIED` posts a superseding SR event and reversal/adjustment events.
5. Correlation IDs stored (`downstream_event_id`, `sr_event_id`).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: SR events append-only (supersession only).
- BR-2: Effects emitted only after order finalisation/serve.
- BR-3: Cross-module failures must not roll back the valid order (eventual consistency via outbox).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `service_register_events` | append (M12) |
| `idempotency_keys` | dedup store **(v2)** |
| `penalty_orders` / `penalty_items` | source + correlation |

| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/orders/{id}/downstream-status` | View propagation status |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Propagation status panel showing SR event id and per-module effect status (queued/done/failed-retry); manual re-trigger (idempotent) for stuck items.

**Edge Cases:** M12 unavailable (outbox retains, retries); duplicate trigger (key dedup); partial downstream success (per-effect status); reduction target designation invalid (validation before emit).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `PropagationStatusPanel`; `SrPostingService`, `OutboxDispatcher`, `EffectMapper`, `IdempotencyService` |
| Backend Flow | On finalise → check/mint idempotency key (TTL) → if seen+match return snapshot; else write outbox entries (SR + per-effect) → dispatcher posts to M12/M06/M10/M11 → record correlation ids → persist response snapshot |
| Data Operations | INSERT `service_register_events`; INSERT/UPDATE `idempotency_keys`; INSERT outbox rows; UPDATE correlations |
| Validation | Effect mapping completeness; key uniqueness + fingerprint match; target refs valid |
| Authorization | DA/Admin trigger; system dispatcher service-account |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Case → `SR_POSTING`→`CLOSED`; SR ledger appended; downstream executed by owners |
| Failure Handling | Upstream down ⇒ outbox + backoff + alert; duplicate key match ⇒ replay snapshot; key mismatch ⇒ 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` |
| Dependencies | M12, M06, M10, M11, idempotency store |
| Test Guidance | Double-finalise ⇒ one SR event; double post-to-SR ⇒ one effect; outbox retry; supersession; per-effect status |

### FR-M09-014 — Document Evidence Vault (Link to M13)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** IO, PO, DCP Admin, DA, Auditor (read)

**User Story:** As an Inquiry Officer, I want a sealed, tamper-evident, digitally-signed evidence vault for all case artefacts so that integrity and confidentiality are guaranteed and provable.

**Description:** Centralises all case artefacts as references to encrypted M13 objects, each with SHA-256 `content_hash`, served/sealed flags, **(v2)** signature metadata, and full read-audit. Served items are visible to the charged officer; sealed items restricted; relied-upon evidence must be disclosed (DI-9).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every artefact upload creates a `case_documents` link with `artefact_type`, `document_id`, `content_hash`, served/sealed flags, and **(v2)** signature metadata where the artefact is signed.
2. Reads of sealed documents recorded as hash-chained `view` audit events.
3. On retrieval, the stored `content_hash` is re-verified; mismatch raises `EVIDENCE_TAMPERED` and alerts.
4. The charged officer can list/download only `is_served=true` artefacts (plus relied-upon disclosed evidence).
5. Vault listing filterable by artefact type and paginated.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Vault items never hard-deleted; supersession/versioning via M13.
- BR-2: Sealing irreversible without DA authorisation and audit.
- BR-3: Confidential-source artefacts inherit DI-9 masking.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |

### FR-M09-015 — Integrity Register & Vigilance Clearance (+ Sealed Cover)

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Vigilance Officer, DA, HR (consumers across modules)

**User Story:** As a Vigilance Officer, I want to maintain each employee's integrity grade, vigilance clearance, and sealed-cover status so that promotions, deputations, retirements, and empanelment can be gated on a reliable signal.

**Description:** Maintains a per-employee vigilance record (clearance status, integrity grade, **(v2)** sealed-cover flag) driven by case lifecycle, and exposes a clearance API consumed by M06/M11. **(v2)** When proceedings are pending, M06 promotion recommendations are held in **sealed cover** (AI-13).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Filing/charging sets `clearance_status=UNDER_PROCEEDINGS`; exoneration sets `CLEAR` and lifts sealed cover.
2. A penalty may set `integrity_grade=DOUBTFUL` for a configured period.
3. A clearance lookup API returns current status with validity window (RBAC-gated).
4. Manual override by Vigilance Officer with mandatory reason and audit.
5. **(v2)** `sealed_cover_flag` is set when proceedings pending and surfaced to M06.
6. All status changes write hash-chained `audit_log` and effective-dated history.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Transitions driven by case events; manual override by Vigilance Officer only.
- BR-2: `NOT_CLEAR`/`UNDER_PROCEEDINGS`/sealed-cover blocks promotion in M06.
- BR-3: Status has validity dates; expired DOUBTFUL auto-reverts to SATISFACTORY review.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Vigilance register grid with status chips, **sealed-cover badge**, validity; employee clearance card; override drawer with reason.

**Edge Cases:** Multiple concurrent cases (most-restrictive wins); clearance during pending appeal (UNDER_PROCEEDINGS retained); retiring employee clearance for pension (M11 consumes).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `VigilanceRegister`, `ClearanceCard`, `OverrideDrawer`; `VigilanceService` |
| Backend Flow | Subscribe to case events → derive status (most-restrictive) + sealed-cover → upsert effective-dated record → serve clearance API |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `vigilance_records`; INSERT `audit_log` |

| Authorization | Read: RBAC (M06/M11 service + Vigilance/DA); write: Vigilance Officer |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Status + sealed-cover drive M06 promotion gate, M11 pension clearance |
| Failure Handling | Concurrent updates ⇒ most-restrictive resolver; 409 on stale write |

### FR-M09-016 — SLA / Statutory-Timeline Tracking, Proportionality Analytics & Case Analytics

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** DCP Admin, DA, Vigilance Officer, Auditor

**User Story:** As a Disciplinary Case Manager, I want each stage tracked against statutory/internal SLAs with lawful pause/resume and escalation, plus analytics including a penalty-proportionality outlier view, so that proceedings are timely and oversight is data-driven.

**Description:** Computes per-stage SLA targets from the template matrix, records hash-chained timeline events, honours **SLA pause/resume (FR-024, DI-18)** so stayed/remitted/consulted cases never show false breaches, raises AT_RISK/BREACHED with escalation, and powers analytics — caseload, ageing, bottlenecks, penalty mix, exoneration rate, appeal-overturn rate, cycle time, and **(v2)** a **penalty-proportionality outlier** view (penalty severity vs misconduct/precedent, AI-12) — feeding M14.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On entering each stage, an `sla_target_at` is computed from the template matrix and a `STAGE_ENTERED` timeline event written.
2. A scheduled evaluator marks `AT_RISK` and `BREACHED` (skipping `PAUSED` stages, DI-18), emitting escalation notifications.
3. The analytics endpoint returns aggregated KPIs with filters and pagination.
4. Ageing buckets (0–30/31–90/91–180/180+) computed per open case.
5. **(v2)** A proportionality-outlier report flags orders whose penalty class is unusually severe for the misconduct vs precedent.
6. Timeline is append-only, hash-chained, and immutable (DI-12/DI-21).

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: SLA matrix is template-configurable per stage/case_type; statutory floors cannot be shortened.
- BR-2: Breach escalations route up the authority hierarchy.
- BR-3: Analytics respect confidentiality (aggregates only for non-privileged viewers).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `case_timeline_events` | SLA events (hash-chained) |

### FR-M09-017 — Procedure Template & Jurisdiction Overlay (Two-Layer Model) **(v2, AI-8, R8)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (configure), all decision guards (consume)

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to configure a procedure template per jurisdiction/case-type so that the same engine can run CCS(CCA), POSH/ICC, and corporate regimes without code changes, while the natural-justice kernel stays invariant.

**Description:** Defines the configurable **overlay** — required consultations and sequence, competence-matrix reference, statutory timelines/floors, valid service modes, appeal limitation, subsistence bounds, and dispense-with-inquiry conditions. The **kernel** (DI-2/3/4/9/13/14/20) is enforced for every template and is not configurable (DI-17). Seeds CCS(CCA) as default.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A template is created/edited with all overlay fields; activation requires SysAdmin.
2. Case creation resolves exactly one active template by jurisdiction + (case_type / misconduct); HARASSMENT ⇒ ICC template.
3. Decision guards (FR-011/018/019/020/021/024) read overlay values from the case's template.
4. Kernel rules cannot be disabled by any template (DI-17); attempts are rejected at config validation.
5. EMAIL is excluded from valid service modes by default and must be explicitly added to be statutory.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Exactly one active template per (jurisdiction, case_type/misconduct) selector.
- BR-2: Statutory floors in `timelines_json` cannot be shortened by case-level config.
- BR-3: Templates are reference data — never edited within an open case's lifecycle retroactively (version pinned at case creation).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `procedure_templates` | CRUD (SysAdmin) |
| `authority_competence` | referenced by `competence_matrix_ref` |
| `disciplinary_cases` | `procedure_template_id` pinned |

| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/admin/procedure-templates` | Create template |
| PUT | `/api/v1/dcp/admin/procedure-templates/{id}` | Update/activate |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Admin template editor with sections for consultations, competence ref, timelines, service modes, limitation, subsistence bounds, dispensation conditions; a read-only "kernel rules (always on)" panel.

**Edge Cases:** No matching template at case creation (`PROCEDURE_TEMPLATE_INVALID`); template edited mid-case (new cases only; open cases keep pinned version); conflicting active selectors (validation blocks activation).

### FR-M09-018 — Authority Competence Matrix & Finalise-Time Competence Guard **(v2, AI-1, R1)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (seed), DA / Appellate Authority (gated)

**User Story:** As the system, I must verify that the authority signing a penalty is competent for that penalty class/type so that no order is void for incompetence under Article 311(1).

**Description:** Maintains the `authority_competence` matrix ((cadre × penalty_class/type) → empowered authority level, with the Art. 311(1) not-subordinate-to-appointing rule for dismissal/removal/CR) and enforces it at order finalise and appeal decision (DI-13). **This is the highest-priority legality control (Council "One Thing To Do First").**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. SysAdmin can seed/maintain the matrix per competence set referenced by templates.
2. At finalise, the system resolves the respondent's cadre + the max penalty class/type and checks `passed_by`'s authority level; sets `competence_verified` and `competence_authority_level`.
3. **A `DISMISSAL` finalised by an authority subordinate to the appointing authority returns `AUTHORITY_NOT_COMPETENT` (409) and cannot persist** (the canonical failing-then-passing test).
4. Appeal decisions verify the appellate authority's competence (DI-13).
5. Every competence decision is recorded in the hash-chained audit.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: For multi-penalty orders, competence is resolved to the **highest** penalty class/type.
- BR-2: DISMISSAL/REMOVAL/CR require not-subordinate-to-appointing-authority.
- BR-3: Competence is verified against the cadre snapshot on `case_respondents` (stable across transfers).

**Data Model References:**

**UI Behavior Notes:** Admin matrix grid (cadre × class/type → level); order composer **competence badge** (green/red) with the resolving rule shown; finalise disabled until green.

**Edge Cases:** Cadre changes by promotion mid-case (snapshot used); no matrix entry for cadre/class (`AUTHORITY_NOT_COMPETENT`, fail-safe deny); delegated authority (modelled as authority level).

### FR-M09-019 — Statutory Consultation Management (UPSC / CVC / ICC / Legal) **(v2, AI-2, R2)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Vigilance Officer, Consulting Authority Liaison, DA

**User Story:** As a DA, I must record and close all mandatory external consultations before finalising so that the order is not set aside for want of consultation.

**Description:** Manages `case_consultations` whose required set is derived from the case's template (e.g. UPSC for central major penalties, CVC first/second-stage for vigilance, ICC for POSH). Finalise is blocked until every mandatory consultation is `CLOSED` (or `WAIVED` with reasons) (DI-14). Consultation advice relied upon as the basis of the penalty must be disclosed (DI-9).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On entering DA consideration, the system pre-creates `REQUIRED` consultations from the template.
2. Each consultation transitions REQUIRED → REQUESTED → RECEIVED → CLOSED (or WAIVED with reasons).
3. Finalise is blocked with `CONSULTATION_PENDING` until all mandatory consultations are CLOSED/WAIVED.
4. Advice documents are confidential; if `is_advice_relied_upon=true`, disclosure to the charged officer is required.
5. A new `case_stage=CONSULTATION` is entered when mandatory consultations are outstanding; an SLA pause (`CONSULTATION`) applies while awaiting external advice.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Mandatory set derived from template; WAIVER requires recorded reasons and competent authority.
- BR-2: CVC second-stage (post-inquiry) precedes final order in vigilance cases.
- BR-3: Awaiting external advice pauses the SLA clock (FR-024).

### FR-M09-020 — Dispense-with-Inquiry (Article 311(2) Provisos) **(v2, AI-3, R3)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As a DA, in the limited lawful circumstances where an inquiry is dispensable, I want to record a reason-coded dispensation so that a penalty can be imposed without a full inquiry without violating due process.

**Description:** Models the lawful shortcut: a reason-coded `inquiry_dispensations` row (CRIMINAL_CONVICTION / NOT_REASONABLY_PRACTICABLE / SECURITY_OF_STATE) with recorded speaking reasons and a competent authority. An APPROVED dispensation satisfies the DI-3 major-penalty inquiry branch via documented exception (DI-23); the reason must be permitted by the template.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A dispensation requires `reason_code` permitted by the template, `recorded_reasons`, and a competent `authority_id`.
2. Status transitions PROPOSED → APPROVED/REJECTED; only APPROVED satisfies DI-23.
3. With an APPROVED dispensation, FR-011 may finalise a penalty without a concluded inquiry (other kernel checks still apply).
4. CRIMINAL_CONVICTION requires a `supporting_ref` (conviction order).
5. Every dispensation is audited and timelined; the inquiry route is set to DISPENSED.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Reason code must be in the template `dispensation_conditions_json`.
- BR-2: Dispensation does not waive competence (DI-13), consultation (DI-14), proportionality (DI-20), or signing (DI-28).
- BR-3: SECURITY_OF_STATE dispensation requires the empowered authority's recorded satisfaction.

### FR-M09-021 — Legal Service of Documents & Digital Signing (DSC/eSign) **(v2, AI-5, AI-17, R5, R17)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** DCP Admin, DA, Process Server

**User Story:** As the system, I must record statutorily-valid legal service separately from informational notifications and require digital signatures on statutory artefacts so that service and signing are legally sound.

**Description:** Provides the `legal_service_records` lifecycle (mode, validity vs template, served_by, proof) distinct from the `notifications` ledger (DI-15), and the DSC/eSign signing service binding signatory identity + trusted timestamp on charge-sheets, inquiry reports, show-cause notices, and orders (DI-28). EMAIL is non-statutory by default.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A legal-service record captures mode, served_date, served_by, and proof; `is_statutorily_valid` computed against the template valid modes.
2. Statutory reply/limitation windows compute only from valid service (DI-15); informational notifications never constitute service.
3. Charge-sheets, reports, show-cause notices, and orders cannot be served/finalised without DSC/eSign metadata (DI-28).
4. Signing calls the platform trust service and stores `signature_type`, `signatory_id`, `signed_at`, `signature_ref`.
5. EMAIL service is flagged non-statutory unless the template explicitly permits it.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Valid modes are template-driven; SUBSTITUTED/PUBLICATION permitted when the officer absconds.
- BR-2: Signatory identity must match the authority empowered for the artefact.
- BR-3: Service proof is stored as an M13 object with hash.

**Data Model References:**

### FR-M09-022 — Common / Joint (Multi-Respondent) Proceedings **(v2, AI-7, R7)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, DCP Admin, IO

**User Story:** As a DA handling collusive misconduct, I want to try co-delinquents in common proceedings sharing one inquiry, witnesses, and evidence so that findings are consistent and effort is not duplicated.

**Description:** Introduces `case_respondents` (1..N charged officers per case) so one inquiry, witness set, and exhibit set cover co-delinquents, with **per-respondent, article-wise findings** and **per-respondent orders/exoneration** (DI-25). Each respondent may have a different competent DA; severance is supported with reasons.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A case can hold multiple `case_respondents`; one is `is_primary`.
2. One inquiry, witness set, and exhibit set are shared; findings are recorded per respondent × article.
3. Show-cause, personal hearing, and penalty orders are issued per respondent.
4. The case cannot close until every ACTIVE respondent has an order/exoneration/abatement (DI-25).
5. Severance (`SEVERED`) requires recorded reasons and spins off a linked case.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Per-respondent competent DA resolved from cadre (DI-13).
- BR-2: Shared evidence is disclosed to all respondents (DI-9).
- BR-3: Inconsistent findings across respondents on identical evidence are flagged for review.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |

### FR-M09-023 — POSH / Internal Committee Procedure **(v2, AI-16, R16)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Internal Committee (Presiding Officer, Members, External Member), DA

**User Story:** As an organisation handling a sexual-harassment complaint, I want the case routed through a POSH Internal Committee with mandated composition and timelines so that it complies with the POSH Act 2013 instead of the ordinary IO route.

**Description:** For `misconduct_category=HARASSMENT` (`is_posh_case=true`), the case uses the **ICC_POSH** template: an Internal Committee is constituted (presiding officer who is a senior woman, members, and ≥1 external member from an NGO/expert) and conducts the inquiry under POSH timelines (e.g. 90-day inquiry, 10-day report); the ICC report feeds the penalty stage in place of the ordinary IO route (AI-16). Confidentiality and anti-retaliation are heightened.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. HARASSMENT cases resolve the ICC template and set `inquiry_route=ICC_POSH`.
2. ICC constitution enforces composition (presiding officer + ≥1 external member); missing ⇒ `ICC_PROCEDURE_REQUIRED`.
3. POSH-specific timelines apply (configurable in the template) and feed SLA tracking.
4. The ICC report (signed) feeds FR-008/FR-011 as the inquiry finding.
5. Heightened confidentiality: complainant identity protected; anti-retaliation flag on the case.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: External member is mandatory for ICC quorum.
- BR-2: Conciliation (if opted by complainant) is recorded before inquiry; no monetary settlement as basis of conciliation.
- BR-3: ICC findings follow the same kernel (competence, consultation if any, proportionality, signing).

### FR-M09-024 — SLA Pause/Resume & Clock Management **(v2, AI-10, AI-18, R10, R18)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** DCP Admin, DA, SLA engine (system)

**User Story:** As a Case Manager, I want the SLA clock to pause lawfully during stays, remits, condonation, consultation, and criminal stays so that the dashboard never shows false breaches.

**Description:** Provides the `sla_pause_events` ledger and recomputation logic (DI-18). When a pause reason occurs (STAY / REMIT / CONDONATION / CONSULTATION / CRIMINAL_STAY), the affected stage's `sla_status=PAUSED`; on resume, `sla_target_at` and `expected_closure_date` are recomputed by adding the paused duration. Integrates with FR-007 (criminal stay), FR-008/009 (remit), FR-012 (condonation), FR-019 (consultation).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A pause event records stage, reason, `paused_from`, `paused_by`, and source ref.
2. While paused, the SLA evaluator raises no breach for that stage (DI-18).
3. On resume, `resumed_at` is set and targets recomputed (`recompute_applied=true`).
4. The timeline records `SLA_PAUSE`/`SLA_RESUME` events (hash-chained).
5. Overlapping pauses for the same stage are coalesced; the dashboard shows total paused duration.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Only defined reasons may pause; each pause has a single owning source.
- BR-2: Pauses are append-only (DI-12); a resume is a new field, not a deletion.
- BR-3: Statutory floors still apply to active (unpaused) time.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|

| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/cases/{id}/sla/pauses` | List pause windows |

**UI Behavior Notes:** SLA ribbon shows `PAUSED` with reason and elapsed paused time; resume action recomputes and displays new targets.

### FR-M09-025 — Personal Hearing Record (Show-Cause / Appeal) **(v2, AI-21)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Disciplinary Authority, Appellate Authority, Charged Officer

**User Story:** As a charged officer, I want a recorded personal hearing at the show-cause/appeal stage so that my right to be heard in person is honoured and provable; and as the authority, I want to record grant/denial with reasons.

**Description:** Models `personal_hearings` for SHOW_CAUSE and APPEAL stages — request, grant/denial (with reasons), schedule, minutes — referenced by the relevant show-cause/appeal record (DI-29). Denial of a requested hearing requires recorded reasons and is challengeable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A charged officer's request is recorded (`requested=true`).
2. The authority grants or denies; denial requires `denial_reason` (DI-29).
3. If granted, schedule and minutes (optionally a signed minutes document) are recorded.
4. The show-cause/appeal references the hearing (`personal_hearing_id`).
5. Hearing actions are audited and timelined.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: A personal hearing cannot be silently skipped where requested at show-cause/appeal.
- BR-2: Minutes are immutable once finalised.
- BR-3: The presiding authority must be the DA (show-cause) or appellate authority (appeal).

### FR-M09-026 — Mid-Proceeding Jurisdiction Transfer, Sealed Cover & Retiree Proceedings **(v2, AI-13, R13)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** DCP Admin, Disciplinary Authority, Vigilance Officer

**User Story:** As a Case Manager, when a charged officer is transferred, promoted, or retires mid-proceeding, I want the competent authority re-resolved, promotion frozen via sealed cover, and the Rule 9 time-bar/sanction enforced so that the proceeding stays valid against lifecycle changes.

**Description:** Handles employee-lifecycle races against long proceedings: a **jurisdiction-transfer** event re-resolves the competent DA (from M05/M06 changes) and records `JURISDICTION_TRANSFER` in the timeline; **sealed cover** freezes M06 promotion recommendations while proceedings are pending; **retiree proceedings** enforce the CCS (Pension) Rule 9 **four-year event bar** plus required enterprise/President sanction (DI-27).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On a transfer/promotion event for a charged officer, the system re-resolves the competent DA, updates `disciplinary_cases.disciplinary_authority_id` (and per-respondent), and records a `JURISDICTION_TRANSFER` timeline event.
2. While proceedings are pending, M06 promotion is held in **sealed cover** (`vigilance_records.sealed_cover_flag`, `disciplinary_cases.is_sealed_cover`); exoneration lifts it, penalty resolves it per rules.
3. Retiree proceedings require `is_retiree_case=true`, a recorded `retiree_sanction_ref`, and that the misconduct event be within the Rule 9 four-year bar; failing ⇒ `RETIREE_PROCEEDING_BARRED`.
4. The cadre snapshot on `case_respondents` remains stable for competence (FR-018).
5. All changes are audited and timelined.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Competence re-resolution uses the cadre snapshot, not the post-promotion cadre.
- BR-2: Sealed cover is mandatory for pending major-penalty proceedings during a promotion cycle.
- BR-3: Retiree proceedings without sanction or beyond four years are barred.

### FR-M09-027 — Court-Grade Hash-Chained Audit & Verification **(v2, AI-15, R15)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** Auditor, System Administrator, all writers (implicit)

**User Story:** As an Auditor, I want the audit/timeline ledger to be cryptographically tamper-evident (not merely append-only by policy) so that the record is court-grade evidence.

**Description:** Each `case_timeline_events` row stores `seq_no`, `prev_hash` (prior row's `row_hash`), and a computed `row_hash` over the canonical row + prev_hash (DI-21). A verify endpoint recomputes the chain per case and detects any mutation. The platform `audit_log` is mirrored into this chained ledger for module-critical events.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every timeline insert computes `row_hash` from the canonical row content + `prev_hash`.
2. The chain is per-case, monotonic by `seq_no`.
3. A verify endpoint recomputes the chain and returns OK or the first broken `seq_no`.
4. Any DB-layer mutation of a row is detected on verify (`AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN`).
5. Verification is available to Auditor/SysAdmin and is itself audited.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: The ledger is insert-only (DI-12); no updates/deletes.
- BR-2: Hash algorithm is SHA-256 over a canonical serialization.
- BR-3: Verification does not expose confidential field values (hashes only).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `case_timeline_events` | `seq_no`/`prev_hash`/`row_hash` |
| `audit_log` | mirrored critical events |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/cases/{id}/audit/verify` | Verify chain |
| GET | `/api/v1/dcp/cases/{id}/audit/chain` | Chain metadata (hashes) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Audit-integrity card on case detail showing "chain verified" / "broken at seq N"; Auditor verify action.

**Edge Cases:** Concurrent inserts (seq_no allocated transactionally); migration backfill (genesis hash); chain break detection on tamper.

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `AuditIntegrityCard`; `HashChainService`, `AuditVerifyService` |
| Backend Flow | On insert: allocate seq_no, read prev row_hash, compute row_hash in txn; verify: recompute chain, compare |
| Data Operations | INSERT `case_timeline_events` (chained); SELECT for verify |
| Validation | Monotonic seq; hash correctness |
| Authorization | Verify: Auditor/SysAdmin |
| State Changes & Side Effects | None (read for verify) |
| Failure Handling | Mismatch ⇒ 409 `AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN` with first broken seq |
| Dependencies | platform audit |
| Test Guidance | Chain continuity; tamper detection; concurrent insert ordering |

### FR-M09-028 — Abatement on Death / Terminal Handling **(v2, AI-14, R14)**

- **Module:** M09-DCP
- **Primary Role(s):** DCP Admin, Disciplinary Authority

**User Story:** As a Case Manager, when a charged officer dies during proceedings, I want the case (or that respondent) to abate cleanly so that SLAs stop and no penalty effects flow.

**Description:** Adds the terminal abatement path: on charged-officer death (M01 `employment_status=DECEASED`), the case/respondent moves to `ABATED` (`order_type=ABATED`, `case_status=ABATED`), SLAs stop, downstream penalty effects are suppressed, and no further penalty order may be finalised for that respondent (DI-26). Pension/terminal benefits proceed unaffected by abated proceedings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On death detection (or manual record with proof), the case/respondent is set to `ABATED` with `abatement_reason`.
2. An `ABATED` order is recorded (terminal); no PENALTY order can be finalised thereafter (DI-26).
3. Open SLAs stop (pause/close); no breach raised post-abatement.
4. Any queued downstream penalty effects are suppressed/cancelled.
5. An SR event records abatement (FR-013) for the statutory record.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: Abatement is irreversible (subject to correction if death recorded in error, via audited reversal).
- BR-2: In multi-respondent cases, only the deceased respondent abates; others continue.
- BR-3: Abatement does not by itself decide pension — M11 applies its own rules.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `disciplinary_cases` | `case_status=ABATED`, reason |
| `case_respondents` | respondent ABATED |
| `penalty_orders` | `order_type=ABATED` |
| `service_register_events` | abatement event |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/cases/{id}/abate` | Record abatement |
| POST | `/api/v1/dcp/respondents/{id}/abate` | Abate one respondent |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Abatement action with proof-of-death upload; abated badge; SLA ribbon shows stopped; downstream effects shown suppressed.

**Edge Cases:** Death recorded in error (audited reversal); death after order finalised but before service (record per rules); abatement in joint proceedings (single respondent).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Components | `AbatementAction`, `AbatedBadge`; `AbatementService` |
| Backend Flow | Detect/record death → set ABATED → stop SLAs → suppress queued effects → append SR abatement event |
| Data Operations | UPDATE `disciplinary_cases`/`case_respondents`; INSERT `penalty_orders`(ABATED); INSERT `service_register_events` |
| Validation | Death proof; no penalty post-abatement (DI-26) |
| Authorization | DA/Admin |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Case/respondent ABATED; SLA stop; effects suppressed |
| Failure Handling | Penalty finalise on abated ⇒ 409 `CASE_ABATED` |
| Dependencies | M01, M11, FR-013, FR-016 |
| Test Guidance | Abatement stops SLA; suppresses effects; multi-respondent isolation |

## 7. UI Requirements

### 7.1 Screen inventory

| Screen | Primary roles | Key elements |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Disciplinary Case Workbench (list) | DCP Admin, DA, Vigilance | Filterable/paginated case list, status & SLA chips (incl. PAUSED), quick-create, **fast-lane launcher** |
| Case Detail (360°) | DA, IO, PO, Admin | Stage stepper (suspension as **parallel ribbon**), hash-chained timeline, parties/**respondent roster**, artefacts, actions, **legality checklist** (competence/consultation/proportionality/signature) |
| Complaint Intake & Triage | Vigilance, Admin | Source form, dedup panel, triage drawer, **template + DA competence badge** |
| Suspension Manager | DA, Admin | Order form, subsistence slider (template bounds), **NEC chip**, deemed-review banner, review reminders |
| Charge-Sheet Builder | DA, PO, Admin | Article editor, track selector, **DSC/eSign sign step**, PDF preview, **legal-service recorder** (valid modes only) |
| Charged-Officer Portal | Employee | **Rights & Deadlines surface** (entitlements + limitation countdown), served + disclosed documents only, defence submission, personal-hearing request, appeal filing |
| Inquiry Workbench | IO, PO, ICC | **Inspection gate**, hearing calendar, daily order sheet, witness register, exhibit vault (relied/disclosed), ex-parte, **stay control** |
| ICC Workbench | ICC | Composition panel, POSH timeline ribbon, conciliation record, confidentiality banner |
| Inquiry Report Composer | IO/ICC, DA | Per-respondent × per-article finding grid, reasoning, sign, serve/remit |
| DA Consideration & Consultation | DA, Liaison | Accept/disagree, **consultation checklist**, advice uploader |
| Order Composer | DA | Penalty-item builder (recovery-cap validators), reasoning + **proportionality** editors, legality checklist, sign + finalise (MFA) |
| Appeal/Review Console | Employee, Appellate/Reviewing Auth | Filing, limitation indicator, **competence badge**, personal-hearing scheduler, decision screen |
| Evidence Vault Explorer | IO, PO, DA, Auditor | Grouped artefacts, seal/served/**signed**/integrity badges, **audit-integrity card** |
| Vigilance Register | Vigilance Officer | Status grid, **sealed-cover badge**, clearance card, override |
| Admin Configuration | SysAdmin | **Procedure-template editor**, **authority-competence matrix**, SLA matrix |
| Analytics Dashboard | DA, Admin, Auditor | KPI tiles, ageing/bottleneck/penalty-mix charts, **proportionality-outlier** panel |

### 7.2 Cross-cutting UI rules

- Real fields, real data, real states — no skeleton placeholders. Every screen defines **empty / loading / error / success / permission-denied / offline** states.
- WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, focus order, contrast, ARIA labels on all interactive controls.
- Confidentiality: charged-officer views render **only** served + relied-upon-disclosed artefacts; masked complainant identity where flagged.
- Destructive/finalising actions (finalise order, declare ex-parte, post to SR, abate) use confirm dialogs, **DSC/eSign**, and step-up MFA where specified.
- Dates display `DD-MMM-YYYY`; money in INR; all timestamps localised from UTC.
- All lists paginated (max 100/page) with server-side filter/sort.

### 7.3 Rights & Deadlines surface (Charged-Officer Portal) **(v2, AI-19)**

The portal's primary panel is a **rights-and-deadlines guide**, not a document list:
- **Entitlements:** right to a defence assistant; right to a list of relied documents/witnesses and to **inspect** them; right to a **personal hearing** at show-cause/appeal; right to **appeal** within limitation.
- **Deadlines (live countdowns):** defence reply due; representation windows (inquiry report, disagreement memo, show-cause); **appeal limitation** countdown after an order is served.
- **Status:** current stage, whether suspension is active (parallel), whether an inquiry is stayed.
- All entitlements link to the action (request assistant, request inspection, request hearing, file appeal). Denials of requested rights show the recorded reason.

### 7.4 Fast-lane UI path **(v2, AI-22)**

For **minor-track, admitted-charge, single-respondent** cases, a condensed ≈4-screen flow is offered — (1) Intake/Charge, (2) Defence (ADMITS_ALL), (3) Order (proportionality + sign), (4) SR posting. The fast lane is **UI altitude only**: it invokes the **same** services and enforces **every** integrity rule (DI-2/3/4/13/14/20/22/28) and the **same** hash-chained audit chain — it merely hides stages that do not apply (no inquiry, no show-cause where config permits for minor admitted). It never thins legal defensibility.

## 10. API & Integration

### 10.1 Conventions & idempotency lifecycle **(v2)**

- Base path `/api/v1/dcp`; JSON; OIDC JWT bearer; RBAC + row-level + field-level enforcement.
- All list endpoints paginated: `?page=&limit=` (max 100), returning `{ data, page, limit, total }`.
- **Idempotency lifecycle (DI-19, AI-11):** state-changing propagating posts (`/suspensions`, `/orders/{id}/finalise`, `/orders/{id}/post-to-sr`, `/appeals/{id}/decide`) **require** an `Idempotency-Key` header. The server records the key in `idempotency_keys` with a `request_fingerprint` (SHA-256 of canonical body), `scope`, `status`, and `expires_at` (**TTL = 7 days**). Re-sending a known key + matching fingerprint **replays the stored response** with no second effect; a known key with a **different** fingerprint returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` (409). Keys may be client-minted (UUID) or server-minted if absent; expired keys are pruned.
- **Digital signing:** statutory artefacts are signed via `/sign/{artefactType}/{id}` (DSC/eSign) and verifiable via `/verify`.

### 10.2 Canonical error envelope

```json
{
  "error": { "code": "AUTHORITY_NOT_COMPETENT", "message": "Signing authority is subordinate to the appointing authority for a DISMISSAL penalty (Article 311(1)).", "field": "passed_by" },

**Parallel track (not a stage):** `is_under_suspension` may be true across INTAKE…ORDER concurrently; see §12.7.

### 12.2 Charge-sheet state table

| UNDER_REVIEW | decide | DECIDED | reasoning recorded; enhancement ⇒ fresh show-cause |

### 12.6 Suspension state table (parallel track) **(v2)**

| State | Event | Next | Guard |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| ACTIVE | NEC received | ACTIVE (paying) | subsistence event emitted only post-NEC (DI-16) |
| ACTIVE | charge-memo not served in 90 days | ACTIVE (deemed_review) | `deemed_review_flag=true` + escalation (DI-16) |
| ACTIVE | extend | EXTENDED | documented extension |
| ACTIVE | revoke | REVOKED | reason + events emitted |
| ACTIVE | deemed revoke (detention quashed) | DEEMED_REVOKED | proof |

### 12.7 Suspension parallel-status model **(v2)**

Suspension is an **orthogonal status flag** (`disciplinary_cases.is_under_suspension` + `suspension_status`), **not** a node in the linear `case_stage` sequence. The charge/inquiry/order track and the suspension track advance independently; revocation/exoneration clears the flag. This corrects the v1 ontological conflation (Risk R9).

### 12.8 SLA pause/resume state table **(v2)**

| State | Event | Next | Guard |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| RUNNING | pause (STAY/REMIT/CONDONATION/CONSULTATION/CRIMINAL_STAY) | PAUSED | valid reason; open pause row |
| PAUSED | resume | RUNNING | `resumed_at` set; targets recomputed (DI-18) |
| PAUSED | (evaluator tick) | PAUSED | no breach raised while paused |

### 12.9 Consultation state table **(v2)**

| State | Event | Next | Guard |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| REQUIRED | request | REQUESTED | derived mandatory from template |
| REQUESTED | advice received | RECEIVED | advice document |

## 15. Migration & Launch

### 15.1 Data migration

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| M-1 | Inventory legacy disciplinary files; classify by stage |
| M-2 | Map legacy statuses → `case_status`/`case_stage`; **load reference data first: `procedure_templates` (CCS/POSH/corporate), `authority_competence` matrix, SLA matrix, conduct rules** |
| M-3 | Migrate open cases with pinned template + current stage + key artefacts (scanned to M13 with hashes **and signature metadata where available**); closed cases as historical |
| M-4 | Reconstruct hash-chained timeline where dates known (genesis hash for backfill); mark unknowns `N_A`; backfill `case_respondents` (1:1 default) |
| M-5 | Link suspensions/penalties to existing M10/M11/M06 effects without re-triggering (migration flag suppresses re-emit; idempotency keys seeded) |
| M-6 | Reconciliation report: counts by status, orphan checks, hash verification, **competence-matrix coverage check**, **template-resolution coverage check** |

### 15.2 Cutover & launch

- **Build order honours the Council "One Thing To Do First":** seed `authority_competence` + `procedure_templates` and prove the canonical failing-then-passing test (`DISMISSAL` by subordinate authority ⇒ `AUTHORITY_NOT_COMPETENT`) before any decision logic ships.
- Dual-run period: new intake on M09; legacy frozen read-only.
- Idempotency/migration flag prevents duplicate downstream effects during backfill.
- Pilot with one department (incl. one POSH case and one multi-respondent case); validate competence/consultation/service/signing guards and SR posting before org-wide rollout.
- Rollback plan: migration is additive; legacy retained until sign-off.

### 15.3 Launch readiness checklist

- `authority_competence` and `procedure_templates` seeded and approved; **canonical competence test green**.
- RBAC + field-level confidentiality verified; step-up MFA + **DSC/eSign** active.
- SLA matrix, consultation requirements, valid service modes loaded per template.
- Integration smoke tests with M05/M06/M10/M11/M12/M13 + DSC/eSign trust service green.
- Hash-chained audit verify endpoint validated; idempotency double-finalise/double-post tests pass.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), Rights & Deadlines surface, and confidentiality views validated.

### 16.2 Dependency / build order

1. **Foundation (Track A first — Council "One Thing"):** entities E1–E30; **`procedure_templates` + `authority_competence` reference data + competence guard test**; RBAC + field-level confidentiality; hash-chained audit/timeline ledgers; idempotency store.
2. **Intake chain:** FR-001 → FR-002 → FR-003.
3. **Charge & defence:** FR-021 (service/signing) → FR-004 → FR-005.
4. **Inquiry:** FR-006 (+FR-023 ICC) → FR-007 → FR-008 → FR-009; FR-022 multi-respondent; FR-020 dispensation; FR-024 SLA pause.
5. **Decision:** FR-019 (consultation) + FR-018 (competence) gate → FR-010 (+FR-025 hearing) → FR-011.
6. **Propagation:** FR-013 (idempotent; consumed by FR-011/FR-012).
7. **Remedies:** FR-012.
8. **Lifecycle/integrity:** FR-026 (jurisdiction/sealed-cover/retiree), FR-027 (audit verify), FR-028 (abatement).
9. **Cross-cutting:** FR-014 (vault), FR-015 (vigilance), FR-016 (SLA/analytics), FR-017 (template admin) — parallelisable once foundation exists.

### Appendix F — Assumptions & caveats

- Statutory windows (defence reply, limitation, subsistence review, consultation) are seeded as template defaults and **configurable**; the engine enforces a non-shortenable statutory floor and an invariant kernel (DI-17).
- The penalty taxonomy, authority hierarchy, and competence matrix are reference data resolved from org configuration (M01/org_units), `authority_competence`, and the conduct-rules master.
- DSC/eSign is provided by a platform trust service; M09 stores returned signature metadata and verifies on demand.
- Criminal-proceeding linkage is reference-only and may STAY an inquiry; integration with external court/police systems is out of scope.
- The two-layer model deliberately **caps** configurability at the named overlay items; no generic BPM/rules designer is built (anti-over-engineering, per Council §3.5).
