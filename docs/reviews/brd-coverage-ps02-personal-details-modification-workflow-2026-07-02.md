# BRD Coverage Review — PS02 Personal Details Modification Workflow

Date: 2026-07-02
BRD under review: `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md`
Verdict: **FAIL — useful workflow spine implemented, full BRD not yet implemented**

## Scope

The PS02 BRD defines 23 functional requirements from `FR-PS02-001` through `FR-PS02-023` (`docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:983`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2300`). It positions PS02 as the governed change-control layer in front of PS01, using P01 for workflow, P02 for authorization, P05 for audit, PS13 for evidence, and PS01/PS12 for statutory Service Register posting ownership (`docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:27`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:34`).

## Evidence Base

Executable implementation found:

- Single backend service file: `apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts` from `find apps/api/src/modules/ps02 apps/web/src/modules/ps02 -type f`.
- Single web module file: `apps/web/src/modules/ps02/PersonalDetailsWorkspace.tsx`.
- Routes are limited to create, list, approve, reject, commit, and reverse in `apps/api/src/routes/ps02.routes.ts:14` through `apps/api/src/routes/ps02.routes.ts:94`.
- Service supports a simplified request model with `displayName`, `pan`, and `aadhaarMasked` as field codes (`apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:9`), only five statuses (`apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:10`), P01 workflow start (`apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:60`), optional PS13 evidence document creation (`apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:189`), display-name-only commit to PS01 (`apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:128`, `apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:135`), and simplified reversal (`apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:161`).
- Tests cover sensitivity/evidence, display-name commit/reversal via PS01, and API happy path (`apps/api/test/ph07-ps02-personal-details.test.cjs:32`, `apps/api/test/ph07-ps02-personal-details.test.cjs:47`, `apps/api/test/ph07-ps02-personal-details.test.cjs:74`).
- Web UI is an evidence panel showing request number, field, routing, SR owner, PS13 document count, and PS01 ownership (`apps/web/src/modules/ps02/PersonalDetailsWorkspace.tsx:9`, `apps/web/src/modules/ps02/PersonalDetailsWorkspace.tsx:44`).

Specification/design coverage found:

- OpenAPI covers a much broader PS02 surface: request lifecycle, route preview, documents, approvals, diff, SLA, effective-date rules, bulk corrections, commit status, SR status, admin config, delegations, templates, e-signature, history/reports, notices, status gate, fraud, reversals, objections, retro events, and step-up (`docs/contracts/openapi/PS02.yaml:33`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS02.yaml:75`).
- SQL data model defines 18 module-owned tables and explicit PS02 ownership boundaries (`docs/data-model/02-PS02-personal-details-workflow.sql:36`, `docs/data-model/02-PS02-personal-details-workflow.sql:37`).
- SQL covers field sensitivity, approval matrix, templates, delegations, bulk correction batches, change requests, change request items, e-signatures, approvals, documents, SLA events, risk signals, retro events, objections, notices, reversals, and step-up (`docs/data-model/02-PS02-personal-details-workflow.sql:133`, `docs/data-model/02-PS02-personal-details-workflow.sql:638`).

## User-Facing Coverage

The BRD requires request wizard, reviewer queue, diff viewer, document verification, SLA timeline, bulk correction, admin config, delegation, template management, e-sign, history/reports, objection/grievance, and step-up surfaces (`docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2307`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2342`). Current UI is a static workflow evidence card, not a usable PS02 workspace (`apps/web/src/modules/ps02/PersonalDetailsWorkspace.tsx:9`, `apps/web/src/modules/ps02/PersonalDetailsWorkspace.tsx:46`).

## Critical Gaps

| Gap ID | Severity | Gap | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PS02-COV-001 | Critical | OpenAPI and schema define a full workflow product, but runtime implements a reduced proof slice. | OpenAPI tags `docs/contracts/openapi/PS02.yaml:33`-`75`; routes `apps/api/src/routes/ps02.routes.ts:14`-`94`; service `apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:36`-`240` |
| PS02-COV-002 | Critical | Sensitive-field commit is intentionally limited to displayName, leaving PAN/Aadhaar/statutory changes uncommittable despite request creation support. | Supported field codes `apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:9`; displayName-only guard `apps/api/src/modules/ps02/personalDetailsService.ts:134`-`135` |
| PS02-COV-003 | High | Compliance-heavy controls are absent: step-up, strong e-sign, dual-auth reversal, notice/objection, fraud, SLA escalation, and retro reconciliation. | BRD FRs `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:1337`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:1798`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:1914`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2025`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2082`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2196`, `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2252` |
| PS02-COV-004 | High | UI does not implement the BRD workflow screens. | BRD UI `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md:2307`; UI file `apps/web/src/modules/ps02/PersonalDetailsWorkspace.tsx:9`-`46` |

## Scorecard

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| BRD line-item implementation | 8 / 23 FRs materially touched | Most are partial; 15 are runtime gaps |
| API contract conformance | Low to medium | Runtime route surface is much smaller than OpenAPI |
| Data model coverage | High as design artefact | SQL covers required tables but app runtime is in-memory and reduced |
| Backend behavior | Medium for proof slice | Create/approve/reject/commit/reverse work for display-name slice |
| Frontend behavior | Low | Static status/evidence card |
| Automated tests | Low to medium | Good proof-slice tests; no full workflow coverage |

Validation baseline captured during this review:

- `npm test` passed: 125/125 API tests.
- `npm run web:test` passed: 32/32 web tests.
- These green checks validate the implemented proof slice; they do not close the PS02 BRD gaps listed here.

## Recommended Remediation Path

1. Keep the current proof slice as the regression baseline.
2. Expand PS02 around the highest-risk compliance path first: sensitive self-service request for PAN/Aadhaar/category with step-up, document verification, e-sign, P01 decision, and PS01 commit ownership.
3. Add notice/objection and dual-auth reversal before bulk correction.
4. Add SLA, fraud, retro reconciliation, and reporting once the sensitive-change transaction is durable.
