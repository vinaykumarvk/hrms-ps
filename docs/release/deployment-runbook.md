## Deployment Steps

1. Confirm change window, approvers, and rollback owner.
2. Freeze release branch and record artifact checksums.
3. Apply configuration using environment variables only; no secrets in repository.
4. Deploy API and web artifacts to staging.
5. Run smoke checks for P01, PS01, PS12, PS13, PS10, PS11, and PS14.
6. Refresh PS14 mart and record refresh hash.
7. Confirm monitoring, audit, and backup jobs are active.
8. Park before production cutover until the human release authority records approval.

## Human Gate

Production deployment, UAT sign-off, cutover, and rollback authorization require explicit human approval. The marker is `CUTOVER_HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED`.
