# PS10 — Payroll and Benefits Management — Acceptance & E2E Test Suite

## 1. Header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | **PS10 — Payroll and Benefits Management** (alias PS-M10; Phase-2 platform-native extension of PrimeSoft M06/M07/M14) |
| BRD | `docs/brd/v3/PS10-payroll-and-benefits.md` (v3.1) |
| Contracts | `docs/contracts/openapi/PS10.yaml` · `docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.yaml` (`ERR-PS10-*`) · `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml` (PS10) · `docs/contracts/auth-matrix.yaml` (PS10) |
| Scope | Black-box acceptance + E2E of FR-PS10-01…23: pay-rules DSL, rate tables (PT-by-state), salary structures, monthly run engine (single-in-flight, rounding-balanced), LWP/subsistence/dies-non, statutory deductions (GPF/NPS/PT/TDS), TDS pipeline, loans + concessional-loan perquisite, recoveries (net floor / s.60 / legal-eligibility), arrears + dependent cascade, off-cycle/supplementary, benefits + leave encashment + gratuity, payslip reopen-versioning, DSC bank disbursement + positive-pay + suspense holds, register/reconciliation tie-out, approval/lock/reopen, Form-16/24Q from MATCHED, remittance loop + GL journal, FnF, perquisites (Rule 3), snapshot contract, and the PS12 SR write-port. |
| Out of scope | Platform engines P01/P02/P05/P06/X.1/X.3/W.* internals; PS01/PS03/PS06/PS09 source logic; PS11 pension disbursal; PS12 ledger internals; PS13 vault internals. PS10 consumes these by contract — tests assert PS10's consumption/behaviour, not the engine internals. |
| Traceability | Every TC lists **Traces-to** (FR + AC / BR / state-transition / ERR code / auth action). Matrix in §3; every FR-PS10-01…23 has ≥1 TC (§3 shows 0 gaps). |

### 1.1 Test environment & data assumptions

- **Base path** `/api/v1`; security `bearerAuth` (JWT carrying resolved roles + `tenant_id`/`entity_id` scope). Every mutating payment/run POST carries `Idempotency-Key` (24h replay). Every response echoes `X-Correlation-Id` (header, never body). Error envelope: `{ error: { code, message, field, details } }` and nothing else on 4xx/5xx.
- **Money precision.** All amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)` fixed-point (no float), rates `NUMERIC(9,4)`. A per-payslip `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` line absorbs `Σ(rounded) − round(Σ)`. Expected monetary values below are exact to the paisa.
- **Multi-tenant.** One enterprise tenant `TEN-ENTERPRISE`; two entities `ENT-REVENUE` (Karnataka postings) and `ENT-WORKS` (Maharashtra postings). Every PS10 row carries `tenant_id` + `entity_id`; an unscoped query is **rejected**, never defaulted to "all".
- **Personas (strict 3-way SoD, enforced by P01/P02):**

| Persona | Login | Role / capability | May |
|---|---|---|---|
| Maya (Maker) | `payroll.officer@ten-enterprise` | `payroll_officer` | configure (draft), run draft/parallel, prepare bank file, prepare FnF, capture challan |
| Arjun (Approver) | `payroll.approver@ten-enterprise` | `payroll_approver` + `PAYROLL_APPROVE` (MFA) | reconcile-review, approve & lock, reopen, certify remittances/Form-16 |
| Devi (Disburser) | `payroll.disburser@ten-enterprise` | `payroll_disburser` + `PAYROLL_DISBURSE` (MFA) | DSC-sign + transmit bank file only |
| Farah (Finance) | `finance@ten-enterprise` | `finance_admin` | confirm treasury debit (positive-pay), GL ack, confirm deposit |
| Hari (DDO/HOD) | `ddo@ten-enterprise` | `hod` + `DDO_SANCTION` | sanction loans/off-cycle/FnF; adjudicate barred overpayment |
| Sysadmin | `orgadmin@ten-enterprise` | `org_admin` | master data (scales/DA/HRA/PT/tax), DSL grammar, rate tables |
| Emp (Employee) | `emp1@ten-enterprise` | `employee` | own payslip/declaration/claims/loan |
| Auditor | `auditor@ten-enterprise` | Org-Admin read + P05 query | read-only everything |

- **Standard rate assumptions** (stated so calc TCs are reproducible; sourced from published enterprise notifications loaded as effective-dated `rate_tables`):
  - NPS: employee 10% + employer 14% of (basic+DA). GPF (pre-2004 DOJ): 6% of basic (voluntary).
  - DA = 50% of basic (effective 2026-01-01). HRA: X-class 30%, Y-class 20%, Z-class 10% of basic. TPT flat ₹3,600 + DA%.
  - PT (KARNATAKA): ₹200/month where monthly gross > ₹25,000; (MAHARASHTRA): ₹300 in Feb, ₹200 other months where gross > ₹10,000.
  - Income-tax **new regime FY2026-27**: 0–3L nil; 3–7L @5%; 7–10L @10%; 10–12L @15%; 12–15L @20%; >15L @30%. Standard deduction ₹75,000. 87A rebate up to taxable ₹7,00,000 (max ₹25,000). Cess 4% on (tax+surcharge). Surcharge 10% > ₹50L.
  - Gratuity = (last basic+DA) × 15/26 × completed years, ceiling ₹20,00,000. Leave encashment = (basic+DA)/30 × eligible days; retirement portion exempt u/s 10(10AA) up to ₹25,00,000.
  - Subsistence (suspended): 50% of leave salary for first 3 months.
  - Concessional-loan perquisite (Rule 3): monthly reducing balance × (SBI reference rate 8.00% − charged rate)/12.
  - Rounding: each component rounded to nearest rupee; residue to `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT`.
- **Baseline employee EMP-1001** (used across calc TCs unless overridden): DOJ 2010-06-01 (GPF scheme), Level-7 basic **₹49,000**, entity `ENT-REVENUE`, state KARNATAKA, city-class Y (HRA 20%), 30-day month, no LWP.
  - DA = 50% × 49,000 = **₹24,500.00**; HRA = 20% × 49,000 = **₹9,800.00**; TPT = 3,600 × 1.50 = **₹5,400.00**.
  - **Gross = 49,000 + 24,500 + 9,800 + 5,400 = ₹88,700.00**.
  - NPS not applicable (GPF scheme); GPF voluntary 6% × 49,000 = **₹2,940.00**; PT = **₹200.00** (gross > 25,000).

## 4. Coverage Summary

### 4.1 By type (primary classification; several TCs are multi-type)

| Type | Count | Test cases |
|---|---|---|
| Functional | 12 | 001, 006, 007, 012, 017, 023, 028, 036, 045, 048, 055, 067, 070, 078 (subset) |

| Authorization-SoD | 12 | 005, 044, 060, 063, 069, 071, 085, 099, 101 (+044,060 auth) |
| Financial-Integrity | 22 | 018, 019, 022, 024, 028, 030, 031, 032, 033, 040, 041, 047, 049, 050, 056, 062, 068, 076, 080, 082, 084, 088 |
| Idempotency | 6 | 020, 021, 053, 064, 096 (+075) |
| State-Transition | 12 | 004, 013, 020, 027, 037, 040, 055, 061, 072, 073, 086, 097 |

| E2E-Flow | 6 | 052, 054, 087, 094, 102 (+032 reopen) |

> Note: types overlap by design (e.g. TC-064 is Idempotency + Financial-Integrity; TC-069/071/085 are Negative + Authorization-SoD). The counts above reflect the dominant tag; the per-TC "Type" field lists all applicable tags.
