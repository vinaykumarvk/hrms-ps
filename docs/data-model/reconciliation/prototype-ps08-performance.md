# PS08 Performance — PrimeSoft Prototype ↔ Schema Reconciliation

**Scope:** PrimeSoft prototype performance/appraisal/PIP/probation screens (field extracts in
`docs/data-model/reconciliation/prototype-extract/`) reconciled against
`docs/data-model/08-PS08-performance-appraisal.sql`.
**Owned schema file:** `08-PS08-performance-appraisal.sql` (ADD-only amendment — new **Section 4**).
**Prior pass:** the CSV recon (`ps08-performance.md`) already added `scorecard_pillars`, `metrics`,
`goal_plans`, `normalization_settings`, `custom_formula_settings`, `calibration_settings`,
`review_definitions`, `review_excluded_employees`, `performance_translations` + 12 goal columns +
`ps08_config_status`. This pass does **not** re-add those; it covers only prototype DATA fields not
yet materialised.

**Legend — Status:** PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING. **Decision:** already-present / add-column /
add-table / note-as-config.
**DATA vs config:** goal instances, self-review text, calibration outcomes, PIP cases, cycle
exclusions and probation decisions are **DATA**; pillars/metrics/goal-plan field matrices/
normalization curves/calibration templates/rating scales are tenant **CONFIG** (already handled).

## Summary of decisions (this prototype pass — additive to CSV pass)

**New DATA tables added (2):** `appraisal_cycle_exclusions`, `probation_confirmations`.

**New columns added (16):**
- `goals` (4): goal_source, category, set_reason, goal_visibility
- `self_appraisals` (2): overall_comments, development_areas
- `calibration_recommendations` (4): potential_rating, employee_ack_status, employee_ack_comments, employee_ack_at
- `performance_improvement_plans` (6): pip_type, trigger_reason, checkin_cadence, support_plan, hrbp_id, next_review_date

**New enums added (7):** ps08_goal_source, ps08_calib_ack_status, ps08_exclusion_source,
ps08_exclusion_reversibility, ps08_exclusion_status, ps08_probation_recommendation,
ps08_probation_conf_status.

**Left as already-present / note-as-config:** scorecard pillars/metrics/goal-plan matrices/
normalization curves/calibration templates/rating scales (CONFIG — CSV pass); review-stage
progress, SLA/escalation, task queues and approval routing (P01 workflow engine + notifications
substrate); per-goal evidence and computed goal scores (jsonb / derived); goal Scope & admin
approval-flow (assignment action + P01, not per-goal facts). The APAR form's terminal
`probation_outcome` is retained; `probation_confirmations` adds the decision lifecycle around it.

### Status tally (row-level across the tables above)
- **PRESENT:** 34
- **PARTIAL:** 9
- **MISSING:** 25

**Validation:** `psql 14` (`-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`) load of `00-platform-core.sql` then
`08-PS08-performance-appraisal.sql` into a throwaway DB — **clean (exit 0 for both)**; new tables
seeded (2 exclusions, 2 probation confirmations) and all 16 new columns confirmed present.
