# PS01 Employee-Profile — Prototype Screen Reconciliation

**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Owner file:** `docs/data-model/01-PS01-employee-profile.sql` (SECTION 7 — RECON prototype additions)
**Core file (unchanged):** `docs/data-model/00-platform-core.sql`
**Sources reconciled:** PrimeSoft prototype field extracts in
`docs/data-model/reconciliation/prototype-extract/` for the 23 employee-profile / directory /
org-chart screens listed below.
**Prior recon (not re-added here):** `docs/data-model/reconciliation/ps01-profile-fields.md`
(CustomFields / National_ID / Profile.docx CSV recon → SECTION 6 additions:
`national_id_types`, `employee_personal_details`, `custom_field_definitions` extras).

**Legend** — Status: PRESENT (already modelled) · PARTIAL (modelled but a real attribute was
missing) · MISSING (absent). Decision: add-column · new-table · already-present ·
note-as-UI/config · out-of-scope. Rows marked **(added)** ship in SECTION 7.

Pure UI chrome (buttons, tab labels, "My profile", "Save changes", visibility toggles,
search placeholders, masking display strings like `XXXX XXXX 4321`) is excluded.

## Counts

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| PRESENT | 34 |
| PARTIAL | 5 |
| MISSING | 22 |

(MISSING rows resolve to: 3 new satellite tables + 1 dependent-details satellite covering the
add-skill / add-visa / add-certification / add-dependent-extras fields; plus the display-only
MISSING rows `dotted-line manager` and `work type`, marked out-of-scope / config rather than added.)

## Structures added (SECTION 7 of `01-PS01-employee-profile.sql` — additive only)

**New enums**
- `ps01_skill_proficiency` (BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED/EXPERT)
- `ps01_visa_sponsor_type` (SELF_SPONSORED/EXTERNAL_SPONSOR)
- `ps01_penny_drop_status` (PENDING/VERIFIED/FAILED)
- `ps01_benefit_type` **+ value** `ESIC` (ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE)

**New tables** (uuid PK, tenant/entity, audit cols, `row_version`, RLS, indexes; sample rows)
- `employee_skills` — add-skill (3 seed rows)
- `employee_visas` — add-visa / work-permit (2 seed rows)
- `employee_professional_certifications` — add-certification, professional creds (2 seed rows)
- `employee_dependent_details` — add-dependent extras + "Insurance covered" (2 seed rows; + 2 seed rows into core `employee_dependents` as data, not a redefinition)

**Columns added to existing PS01 satellites**
- `employee_education` — `start_year`, `grade_type` (+ range check)
- `employee_experience` — `job_description`
- `employee_bank_accounts` — `penny_drop_status`

`00-platform-core.sql` was **not modified** — no core-owned field was genuinely missing
(dependent extras handled via a satellite; work-type/dotted-line are out-of-scope for the
profile golden record).
