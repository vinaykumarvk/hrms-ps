# PH-54 (Remediation Tranche 41) — Human-Gate Verdict

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Chains from:** `docs/spec/ph-53-verdict.md` (tranche 40)
**Baseline:** `docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md`
**Branch:** ph02-rerun (merged to main per sub-phase)

## Suite evidence (oracle-recomputed)

- API `npm test`: **544 pass**, 0 fail, 1 skipped (DATABASE_URL-gated PH-06 persistence test).
- Web `npm run web:test`: **133 pass**, 0 fail.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run web:typecheck`: green.

The PH-54A oracle (and the PH-37A gate at its raised floor) were run **externally** by the driver and are
GREEN. Seventeenth tranche of the user-directed "raise contract coverage" workstream, into PS05 — the last
module not yet touched this workstream. Built by hand — subagents credit-exhausted until 2026-07-08.

> **GREEN here is necessary, not sufficient.** Human review required before advancing.

## What tranche 41 closed — coverage ratcheted further with real, tested routes

| Module | Route exposure | Backing | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PS05** | transfer/counselling reads: `GET /transfers/vacancy-positions/{id}`, `/transfers/reservations/{id}`, `/transfers/reservations`, `/transfers/drives/{driveId}/employees/{employeeId}/preferences`, `/transfers/mutual-orders/{id}`, `/transfers/mutual-orders`, `/transfers/orders/{id}/charge-handovers`, `/transfers/relieving-orders`, `/transfers/joining-reports` | existing `counsellingVacancyService` + `transferService` (get-by-id NOT_FOUND fail-closed), service-tested | `ph54a-ps05-transfer-reads-route.test.cjs` |

Real behavioral routes over already-tested backing — **not** scaffolding. Measured contract coverage ratchets
**504 / 38.1% → 513 / 38.8%** (PS05 **64% → 76%**), and the PH-37 gate floor was raised in lockstep so the gain
is locked.

**Milestone:** with PS05 raised, **all 14 modules (PS01–PS14) have now been advanced above their baseline**
this workstream — PS05 was the last module not yet touched.

## Remaining gaps (still open — this is NOT a 100% claim)

- **Contract coverage is 38.8%** — ~810 of the **1,323** contracted operations remain unimplemented. The
  coverage tool is still **count-based**, not per-operation path matching. The workstream continues by going
  **deeper into every module** — the lowest are now **PS01 (26.7%)**, PS14 (28.9%), PS13 (31.6%), PS07 (33.3%).
- **Persistence workstream:** the hand-built services (PH-16F..PH-54 engines) use in-memory repositories;
  Postgres-backed repos + migrations remain deferred; the `ph06-persistence` migration list froze at 0008.

**Contract-op caveat (quantified):** the OpenAPI contract enumerates **1,323** operations; **513** are
implemented as behavioral kernel routes (**38.8%**).

## Recommendation for the human reviewer

Approve PH-54B, OR direct a further tranche (PH-55). The active workstream (per your steer) is raising
measured coverage by exposing real, tested backing, with the ratchet gate proving each gain and forbidding
regression; the first pass across all 14 modules is complete and further tranches go deeper into each,
starting from the lowest (PS01, PS14). The standing **persistence migration workstream** remains the
alternative. Carried debt is unchanged: in-memory repositories for the newest services.
