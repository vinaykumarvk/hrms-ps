# Employee Transfer, Relieving and Joining Workflow — HRMS Module BRD

**Module code:** M05-TRJ
**Program:** Enterprise HRMS — "PeopleGov / HRMS Suite"
**Document version:** v1.0
**Status:** Baseline for build (parallel-agent ready)
**Owns:** Transfer lifecycle entities (requests, orders, clearances, charge handovers, joining reports, deputations, drives, preferences, transfer policy rules).
**Reuses (does not redefine):** `employees`, `users`, `org_units`, `designations`, `roles`, `permissions`, `service_register_events`, `documents`, `notifications`, `audit_log`, `workflow_instances`, `workflow_tasks` — all per `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Employee Transfer, Relieving and Joining Workflow module (M05-TRJ) digitises the **end-to-end employee mobility lifecycle** of a enterprise/public-sector organisation: from the **initiation of a transfer** (by request, administrative decision, mutual exchange, deputation, or promotion-linkage), through **transfer-order generation and the statutory approval chain**, **relieving at the source office** (departmental no-dues/clearance, handover of charge, last-working-day, relieving order), the **transfer-in-transit / joining-time period**, and finally **joining at the destination office** (joining report, charge assumption, confirmation of joining date). Every materially significant event is posted as a statutory **Service Register (SR) event** to the Digital SR (M12).

The module replaces a paper-driven, multi-office, hand-carried "Last Pay Certificate + relieving letter + joining report" process that today causes pay gaps, disputed seniority dates, lost no-dues forms, and unauditable transit periods. It establishes a **single auditable system of record** for who is posted where, from when, under what order, and with what dues outstanding.

### 1.2 Business context (public-sector statutory)
Transfers in enterprise are **regulated administrative actions**. They are constrained by transfer policy (minimum tenure at a post, transfer ban/freeze periods such as election model-code-of-conduct windows, protected categories such as spouse-posting, medical grounds, single-parent, differently-abled, near-retirement protection), by **vacancy and sanctioned-strength** discipline, and by **due process** (competent/appointing authority sanction, transfer counselling for cadre drives). Relieving and joining have **pay and seniority consequences**: the date of relieving and date of joining define the **transit period**, joining time admissibility, pay continuity, and the **seniority/service continuity** recorded in the Digital SR. Errors are statutorily and financially material.

### 1.3 Scope summary
In scope: transfer request/initiation across all transfer types; eligibility & policy enforcement; counselling/preference capture; vacancy-driven and bulk transfer drives; transfer-order generation, approval, amendment, cancellation and revocation; relieving (no-dues clearance, charge handover, relieving order, last working day); transit-period management; joining (joining report, charge assumption); deputation & repatriation; SR-event posting; module notifications, reporting and analytics.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere, integrated): the canonical employee master (M01), promotion decisioning and seniority computation (M06 — M05 consumes promotion-linked transfer triggers and writes posting changes), payroll Last Pay Certificate generation and pay disbursement (M10 — M05 raises the LPC trigger and pay-stop/pay-start signals), pension/retirement (M11), the Digital SR ledger itself (M12 — M05 is a writer), and the document object store (M13 — M05 stores order/clearance PDFs there).

### 1.4 Primary outcomes & KPIs
| Outcome | KPI | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Faster relieving | Median time order-issued → relieved | ≤ 5 working days |
| No pay gaps | % transfers with continuous pay (no break) | ≥ 99% |
| Auditable transit | % transfers with recorded relieving + joining dates | 100% |
| Policy compliance | % orders violating ban/tenure rules at issue | 0% (hard-blocked) |
| Clearance discipline | % relievings with all mandatory no-dues closed | 100% |
| SR integrity | % transfer/relieving/joining events posted to M12 | 100% |
| Self-service adoption | % transfer requests raised via self-service portal | ≥ 70% |

### 1.5 Key stakeholders
Employees (transferees), Reporting Managers, HR Officers/Admins at source and destination offices, Department Heads / Appointing & Transfer Authorities, Clearance Officers (IT, Library, Accounts, Stores, Advances, Quarters/Estate), SR Custodian/Registrar (M12), Payroll Officer (M10), Auditors, and System Administrators.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited platform behaviours, applied in this module)
- **Maker-checker workflow** via the shared workflow engine for every order, relieving, and joining action.
- **Segregation of duties:** initiator ≠ approver; transferee may never approve own transfer or self-clear a no-dues item; clearance officer ≠ transferee.
- **Row-level scoping** by `org_unit_id`: source-office HR sees relieving; destination-office HR sees joining; a transferee in transit is visible to both.
- **Immutable audit** (`audit_log`) on every state transition, with before/after snapshots.
- **Soft delete** (`is_deleted`) on transactional entities except append-only ledgers/SR.
- **Document binding:** every generated order and signed clearance/handover/joining artefact is stored in M13 `documents` and referenced by ID.
- **i18n / locale:** dates `DD-MMM-YYYY`; UTC storage; INR money; bilingual order templates.
- **Pagination:** all list endpoints cursor/page-limit, hard max page size 100.

### 2.3 In-scope / Out-of-scope boundary table
| Concern | In M05 | Owned by |
|---|---|---|
| Transfer order data & lifecycle | ✅ | M05 |
| No-dues / clearance | ✅ | M05 |
| Charge handover/assumption | ✅ | M05 |
| Joining report | ✅ | M05 |
| Deputation/repatriation records | ✅ | M05 |
| Employee master fields (designation, current org_unit) | Updated by M05 on join | M01 (owner) |
| Promotion decision & seniority math | Consumes trigger | M06 |
| Last Pay Certificate, pay-stop/pay-start, pay recovery | Raises signals | M10 |
| SR ledger entries | Writes events | M12 |
| Order/clearance PDFs storage | References | M13 |

### 2.4 Assumptions & constraints
- Sanctioned strength / vacancy data for posts is available from M06/M01 reference services; if unavailable, vacancy-driven flows degrade to manual destination entry with a warning (no hard block).
- Transfer policy parameters (tenure thresholds, ban calendars, protected categories) are configurable master data maintained by System Administrators and Transfer Authorities; the module ships seeded defaults.
- A transfer always has exactly one source `org_unit` and one destination `org_unit` (deputation destination may be an external organisation modelled as an `org_unit` of type `EXTERNAL`).
- "Office" = an `org_unit` of a transferable type; clearance departments are configured per office.

### 5.6 Data integrity rules
1. **One active order per employee:** an employee may have only one `transfer_order` in a non-terminal status (`PUBLISHED`→`JOINED`) at any time; a second issuance is `CONFLICT (409, TRJ_ACTIVE_TRANSFER_EXISTS)`.
2. **Relieving precondition:** a `relieving_order` may reach `ISSUED` only if its `clearance_checklist.status ∈ {CLEARED, CLEARED_WITH_DUES}` and `has_outstanding_dues` either false or `dues_recovery_ref` present.
3. **Joining precondition:** a `joining_report` may reach `JOINED_CONFIRMED` only if linked `transfer_order.status = IN_TRANSIT` (i.e., relieved) — except `JOINING_WITHOUT_RELIEF` exceptions explicitly flagged.
4. **Date monotonicity:** `order_date ≤ relieve_by_date`; `last_working_day ≥ order_date`; `joining_date ≥ last_working_day`; `repatriation_due_date ≥ start_date`.
5. **Mutual symmetry:** a `MUTUAL` request requires a reciprocal request linking `mutual_counterpart_employee_id`; both must be approved together (atomic).
6. **Sanctioned-strength guard:** allotment to a `vacancy_position` requires `vacant_count > 0` at commit (re-checked transactionally).
7. **Maker ≠ checker & transferee exclusion:** enforced on every approval/clearance write.
8. **SR posting completeness:** on each of order-publish, relieve, and join, exactly one corresponding `service_register_events` row must be confirmed; failures retried and surfaced (FR-TRJ-012).
9. **No orphan clearance:** `clearance_items` are created only with a parent `clearance_checklist`; checklist `total_items` = count of items.
10. **Soft delete** never applied to records already posted to SR (M12 immutability) — such records are cancelled/revoked with reason, not deleted.

### FR-TRJ-001 — Transfer Request Initiation (all types)
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Initiation
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Transferee), Reporting Manager, HR Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** *As an employee or HR officer, I want to initiate a transfer request of any type (on-request, administrative, mutual, deputation, promotion-linked, compassionate) so that mobility is captured in a structured, auditable way before an order is issued.*
- **Description:** Provides a unified intake for all transfer types. Self-service employees may raise `TRANSFER_ON_REQUEST`/`MUTUAL`/`COMPASSIONATE`; managers may endorse/raise for reports; HR Admin raises `ADMINISTRATIVE`; the system raises `PROMOTION_LINKED` from an M06 trigger. Captures source, requested destination, ground, supporting documents (M13), priority category, and requested effective date. On submission it runs the eligibility/policy engine (FR-TRJ-002) and routes for recommendation/approval through the workflow engine.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A request can be created in `DRAFT` and edited until `SUBMITTED`.
  2. `transfer_type` and `request_origin` are mandatory; field combinations are validated (e.g., `MUTUAL` requires `mutual_counterpart_employee_id`).
  3. On submit, an eligibility check runs and its result is stored in `eligibility_result`; a `HARD_BLOCK` prevents submission with a clear reason.
  4. A unique `request_no` is generated on first submission.
  5. Supporting documents for `MEDICAL`/`SPOUSE` grounds are mandatory and stored in M13.
  6. Every create/submit writes `audit_log` and (on submit) creates a `workflow_instance`.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Employee origin may only create requests for self; manager for direct reports; HR Admin for their org scope.
  - Promotion-linked requests are system-originated and read-only to employees.
  - A transferee with an active non-terminal order is blocked (integrity rule 5.6-1).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | `transfer_requests` | Create/update primary record |
  | `employees` | Validate transferee, source org_unit |
  | `documents` | Supporting evidence |
  | `workflow_instances` | Approval routing |
  | `audit_log` | Trail |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/requests` |
  | PATCH | `/api/v1/transfers/requests/{id}` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/requests/{id}/submit` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/requests?status=&type=&cursor=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Wizard with type selector → details → grounds & documents → review. Inline eligibility banner (green/amber/red). Mutual flow shows counterpart search & reciprocal-link confirmation.
- **Edge Cases:** Counterpart not found / not eligible; duplicate active request; document upload failure (request stays DRAFT); promotion trigger arrives for an employee already in transit.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `TransferRequestWizard` (UI), `TransferRequestController`, `TransferRequestService`, `EligibilityClient` |
  | Backend Flow | Validate role-scope → persist DRAFT → on submit call EligibilityService → if not HARD_BLOCK, generate `request_no`, set `SUBMITTED`/`ELIGIBILITY_CHECK`, open workflow |
  | Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `transfer_requests`; INSERT `workflow_instances`; INSERT `audit_log` (transaction) |
  | Validation | Type/origin matrix; mandatory grounds docs; date ≥ today; mutual counterpart symmetry |
  | Authorization | Self/team/org scope per §3; JWT + RBAC + row-level |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | `DRAFT`→`SUBMITTED`→`ELIGIBILITY_CHECK`; notification to recommender |
  | Failure Handling | Eligibility upstream down → allow DRAFT save, block submit with `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`; doc upload fail rolls back submit |
  | Dependencies | FR-TRJ-002, M01, M13, workflow engine, M06 (promotion trigger) |
  | Test Guidance | Unit: type/origin matrix; integration: submit→workflow; negative: active-order block, missing medical doc |

### FR-TRJ-002 — Transfer Policy & Eligibility Validation
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Policy & Eligibility
- **Primary Role(s):** System (engine), HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As the organisation, I want every transfer evaluated against tenure, ban-window, protected-category and sanctioned-strength policy so that no order violates statutory transfer rules.*
- **Description:** A rules engine evaluating a candidate request/order against `transfer_policy_rules` and `transfer_ban_periods`. Produces per-rule verdicts (`PASS`/`WARN`/`BLOCK`/`OVERRIDE_REQUIRED`) and an aggregate. `HARD_BLOCK` stops progress; `REQUIRE_OVERRIDE` permits a Transfer Authority to override with recorded justification; `SOFT_WARN` proceeds with a logged warning. Protected categories (spouse, medical, differently-abled, near-retirement, single-parent) relax or exempt specific rules.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Engine returns an itemised result with rule_code, verdict, message for each evaluated rule.
  2. Minimum-tenure computed from employee's date of joining current post (last `JOINED` order or M01 posting date).
  3. Ban-window check is date-range and org-scope aware, honouring `exception_grounds`.
  4. Sanctioned-strength check blocks allotment when `vacant_count = 0`.
  5. Overrides require role = Transfer Authority + mandatory justification, captured in `audit_log` and `eligibility_result`.
  6. Engine is idempotent and re-runnable; the latest result is cached on the request/order.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Protected `MEDICAL`/`SPOUSE`/`COMPASSIONATE` may bypass ban windows only when listed in `exception_grounds`.
  - Near-retirement (within configured months) requires override even for admin transfers.
  - Cooling period after a recent transfer triggers `SOFT_WARN` or `BLOCK` per rule config.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_policy_rules`, `transfer_ban_periods`, `transfer_requests.eligibility_result`, `employees`, `vacancy_positions`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/eligibility/evaluate` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/requests/{id}/override` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/policy-rules` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Eligibility panel lists each rule with icon + message; override modal (Transfer Authority only) demands justification ≥ 20 chars.
- **Edge Cases:** Conflicting rules (most restrictive wins); employee with no recorded current-post date (fallback to M01 DOJ); overlapping ban periods; rule effective-date boundaries.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `EligibilityService`, `PolicyRuleRepository`, `BanPeriodRepository`, `OverrideController` |
  | Backend Flow | Load active rules in scope (cadre+org) → evaluate each → aggregate (most restrictive) → persist result |
  | Data Operations | SELECT rules/ban_periods/vacancy; UPDATE `eligibility_result`; INSERT `audit_log` on override |
  | Validation | Date math (tenure, retirement); scope precedence; override role check |
  | Authorization | Evaluate: any initiator; Override: Transfer Authority only |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Sets request to `ELIGIBILITY_CHECK`→ proceed/blocked; no SR event |
  | Failure Handling | Missing strength data → degrade strength rule to `SOFT_WARN` with notice |
  | Dependencies | FR-TRJ-001/003/004, M01, M06 |
  | Test Guidance | Rule-matrix unit tests; boundary tests on dates; override authz negative tests |

### FR-TRJ-003 — Counselling, Vacancy Publication & Preference Capture
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Counselling & Preferences
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Employee, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want to publish vacancies and let eligible employees record ranked preferences so that allotment in a drive is transparent and seniority/merit-based.*
- **Description:** Publishes `vacancy_positions` (with geo-coordinates for mapping), opens a preference window for a drive, lets eligible employees submit a ranked option list, and supports counselling-based allotment by seniority/merit/preference. Feeds FR-TRJ-005 (bulk drives) and FR-TRJ-004 (order generation).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Only published, in-scope vacancies are selectable as preferences.
  2. Employees may add/reorder/delete preferences only within the open window.
  3. Preference ranks are unique and contiguous per employee per drive.
  4. Allotment respects `allotment_method`; results mark `allotted=true` and reserve the vacancy.
  5. Seniority score is pulled from M06 at allotment time.
- **Business Rules:** Employee must pass FR-TRJ-002 to participate; a vacancy cannot be over-allotted beyond `vacant_count`; manual override by Transfer Authority is logged.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_drives`, `transfer_preferences`, `vacancy_positions`, `employees`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/vacancies` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/vacancies?published=true` |
  | PUT | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/preferences` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/allot` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Vacancy map + list; drag-to-rank preference builder with live eligibility; countdown to window close; allotment results grid for HR.
- **Edge Cases:** Window closed mid-edit; vacancy filled by another allotment concurrently; tie in seniority (deterministic tiebreak by service_no); duplicate preference.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `VacancyService`, `PreferenceService`, `AllotmentEngine`, `VacancyMap` (UI) |
  | Backend Flow | Publish vacancies → open window → capture prefs → run allotment (ordered by method) with row-level locks on vacancies |
  | Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `vacancy_positions`,`transfer_preferences`; UPDATE `filled/vacant` counts in transaction with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` |
  | Validation | Window dates; rank contiguity; published-only; capacity |
  | Authorization | Vacancies/allot: HR Admin/Authority; prefs: employee (own) |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Drive `OPEN`→`COUNSELLING`→`ALLOTTED`; allotment creates draft requests/orders feed |
  | Failure Handling | Concurrent allot → optimistic/row lock, retry; over-capacity → `CONFLICT` |
  | Dependencies | FR-TRJ-002/004/005, M06 (seniority) |
  | Test Guidance | Concurrency tests on allotment; rank-integrity; window-boundary |

### FR-TRJ-004 — Transfer Order Generation, Approval Chain & Publication
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Approval & Order
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want approved requests/allotments converted into a numbered, statutory transfer order and published so that source and destination offices act on a single authoritative document.*
- **Description:** Generates a `transfer_order` from an approved request/allotment (or directly for admin orders), routes through the configured approval chain (recommend → sanction by Appointing/Transfer Authority), assigns a statutory `order_no`, renders a bilingual PDF (M13), publishes to both offices, sets `relieve_by_date`/`joining_time_days`, and posts the **transfer SR event** (via FR-TRJ-012). Publication kicks off relieving (FR-TRJ-006).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Order can only be created from an `APPROVED` request, an allotment, or a direct admin action with prior eligibility pass.
  2. Approval chain enforces maker ≠ checker and transferee exclusion.
  3. On approval, a unique sequential `order_no` is assigned and an immutable PDF is generated and stored in M13.
  4. Publication sets status `PUBLISHED`, notifies transferee + both offices, and triggers SR posting and clearance-checklist creation.
  5. Mutual orders are approved/published atomically as a pair.
- **Business Rules:** Re-validate FR-TRJ-002 at approval (ban windows may have changed); active-transfer uniqueness (5.6-1); deputation orders also create a `deputation_records` row (FR-TRJ-011).
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `transfer_requests`, `documents`, `service_register_events`, `workflow_instances`, `clearance_checklists`, `deputation_records`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/approve` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/publish` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Order composer with template preview; approval timeline; publish confirmation showing downstream effects; PDF viewer.
- **Edge Cases:** Order number collision (retry sequence); PDF render failure (order stays `APPROVED`, publish blocked); ban window now active at approval; destination vacancy filled meanwhile.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `TransferOrderService`, `OrderNumberGenerator`, `PdfRenderClient(M13)`, `SrPostingClient(M12)`, `ApprovalWorkflow` |
  | Backend Flow | Create draft → workflow approval → on final approve: re-run eligibility, allocate `order_no` (sequence), render+store PDF, set APPROVED → publish: status PUBLISHED, create clearance checklist, post SR, notify |
  | Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `transfer_orders`; INSERT `clearance_checklists`(+items), `service_register_events`, `documents` ref, `audit_log` (single transaction; SR via outbox) |
  | Validation | Source status APPROVED; eligibility re-check; maker≠checker; date rules |
  | Authorization | Generate: HR; Approve/Publish: Transfer Authority |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | `DRAFT`→`PENDING_APPROVAL`→`APPROVED`→`PUBLISHED`→`RELIEVING_IN_PROGRESS`; SR event; M10 not yet signalled |
  | Failure Handling | SR post failure → outbox retry, order flagged `SR_PENDING` (FR-TRJ-012); PDF fail blocks publish |
  | Dependencies | FR-TRJ-002/003/006/011/012, M12, M13, workflow |
  | Test Guidance | Sequence uniqueness under load; atomic mutual pair; publish side-effect verification |

### FR-TRJ-005 — Bulk Transfer Drive Management
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Bulk Drives
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As HR Admin, I want to run an annual/seasonal transfer drive that batch-processes hundreds of transfers so that large cadre movements are efficient and consistent.*
- **Description:** Manages a `transfer_drive` lifecycle: define scope/cadre, publish vacancies, open preference window (FR-TRJ-003), run allotment, and **batch-generate orders** (FR-TRJ-004) with progress tracking, partial-failure isolation, and a drive dashboard. Supports CSV import of candidate lists and bulk eligibility pre-screening.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A drive progresses through `DRAFT`→`OPEN`→`COUNSELLING`→`ALLOTTED`→`ORDERS_ISSUED`→`CLOSED`.
  2. Bulk eligibility pre-screen flags blocked candidates before allotment.
  3. Batch order generation is resumable; a failed candidate does not abort the batch (quarantine + report).
  4. A drive dashboard shows counts by stage and pendency.
  5. Closing a drive requires all allotted candidates to have orders issued or explicitly excluded.
- **Business Rules:** Each candidate still passes per-candidate eligibility (FR-TRJ-002) and uniqueness (5.6-1); ban-window applies to whole drive unless exempted.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_drives`, `transfer_preferences`, `vacancy_positions`, `transfer_requests`, `transfer_orders`.

### FR-TRJ-006 — Relieving: No-Dues / Clearance Checklist
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Relieving — Clearance
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source), Clearance Officers (IT, Library, Accounts, Stores, Advances, Estate/Quarters), Employee
- **User Story:** *As a source HR officer, I want a departmental no-dues checklist auto-created on order publication so that the employee is cleared by every department before relieving.*
- **Description:** On order publication a `clearance_checklist` with `clearance_items` for each configured department of the source office is generated. Each Clearance Officer marks their item `CLEARED`/`DUES_OUTSTANDING`/`WAIVED` with optional dues amount and evidence (M13). The employee sees live progress. The checklist reaches `CLEARED` (all cleared) or `CLEARED_WITH_DUES` (cleared with recovery linkage). This gates the relieving order (FR-TRJ-008).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Checklist auto-created with one item per configured department of the source office.
  2. Only the assigned Clearance Officer (or HR override with reason) can update an item.
  3. Outstanding dues require a `dues_amount` and/or description; checklist cannot reach `CLEARED` while dues are open unless converted to `CLEARED_WITH_DUES` with `dues_recovery_ref`.
  4. Employee and source HR see real-time status; reminders sent for pending items > SLA.
  5. Every item change writes `audit_log`.
- **Business Rules:** Clearance Officer ≠ transferee; dues link to M10 recovery; `WAIVED` requires HR Admin/Authority approval.
- **Data Model References:** `clearance_checklists`, `clearance_items`, `transfer_orders`, `documents`, `notifications`.
- **API References:**

  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/clearance` |
  | PATCH | `/api/v1/clearance/items/{id}` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/clearance/{checklistId}/finalize` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Clearance board (per-department cards: pending/cleared/dues); officer action drawer with dues + evidence; employee tracker view.
- **Edge Cases:** Department has no assigned officer (fallback to dept head queue); dues disputed; officer on leave (delegate); destination clearance not applicable.

### FR-TRJ-007 — Charge Handover at Source
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Relieving — Charge Handover
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (relinquishing), Charge Receiving Officer, HR Officer (Source)
- **User Story:** *As a relieving employee, I want to formally hand over charge, records, assets and cash/imprest to a successor so that accountability transfers cleanly.*
- **Description:** Records a `charge_handover` (phase `HANDOVER_SOURCE`) listing assets (with asset IDs), pending files, cash/imprest balances, and a handover note (M13). The receiving officer/successor accepts or disputes. Acceptance is a precondition (configurable) for the relieving order.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Handover captures asset inventory, cash/imprest, pending files, and a note document.
  2. Receiving officer can `ACCEPT` or `DISPUTE` with remarks.
  3. Disputed handover blocks relieving until resolved.
  4. Charge type (`FULL`/`ADDITIONAL`/`CURRENT_DUTIES`) is recorded.
- **Business Rules:** Relinquisher ≠ acceptor; cash/imprest mismatch flags an accounts clearance dependency (FR-TRJ-006).
- **Data Model References:** `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `employees`, `documents`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Handover form with asset table + cash fields + note upload; acceptor review screen with accept/dispute.
- **Edge Cases:** No successor identified (handover to office/link officer); partial asset return; additional-charge relinquishment.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `ChargeHandoverService`, `ChargeController`, `ChargeForm` |
  | Backend Flow | Create handover → notify acceptor → accept/dispute updates status → gate relieving |

### FR-TRJ-008 — Relieving Order, Last Working Day & Pay-Stop
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Relieving — Order & LWD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source), Transfer Authority, Payroll Officer
- **User Story:** *As source HR, I want to issue a relieving order setting the last working day once clearance and handover are complete so that the employee is formally relieved and pay continuity is managed.*
- **Description:** Issues a `relieving_order` once clearance (FR-TRJ-006) and charge handover (FR-TRJ-007) preconditions are met. Sets `last_working_day`, relieving time (FN/AN), generates the relieving order PDF (M13), signals **pay-stop** and **LPC request** to M10, transitions the transfer order to `RELIEVED`→`IN_TRANSIT`, and posts the **relieving SR event** (FR-TRJ-012).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Relieving order can only be issued when clearance status ∈ {CLEARED, CLEARED_WITH_DUES} and (if required) handover ACCEPTED.
  2. `last_working_day` ≥ order_date and ≤ `relieve_by_date` (late relief flagged for review, not hard-blocked).
  3. On issue: PDF stored, pay-stop + LPC signalled to M10, SR relieving event posted, transfer order → `IN_TRANSIT`.
  4. A unique `relieving_order_no` is generated.
- **Business Rules:** Pay-stop must align with LWD; LPC requested exactly once; relieving beyond `relieve_by_date` requires remark.
- **Data Model References:** `relieving_orders`, `clearance_checklists`, `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `documents`, `service_register_events`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |

  | POST | `/api/v1/relieving-orders/{id}/issue` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/relieving-orders/{id}` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Relieving panel showing clearance/handover readiness gauges; LWD picker; issue button disabled until preconditions met; confirmation lists downstream signals.
- **Edge Cases:** Relieving after deadline; pay-stop signal failure (queued); employee absent on planned LWD; clearance reopened after issue (revoke path FR-TRJ-013).
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `RelievingService`, `PayrollSignalClient(M10)`, `SrPostingClient(M12)`, `RelievingPanel` |
  | Backend Flow | Verify preconditions → create relieving_order → on issue: number, render PDF, signal M10 (pay-stop+LPC), post SR, update transfer order IN_TRANSIT |
  | Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE `relieving_orders`,`transfer_orders`; INSERT SR event, document ref, `audit_log` (txn + outbox for external signals) |
  | Validation | Precondition gate; date rules; single LPC |

### FR-TRJ-009 — Transfer-in-Transit & Joining-Time/Gap Management
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Transit Management
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source/Destination), Employee, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want the period between relieving and joining tracked with admissible joining time so that transit/gap periods are visible, controlled, and not abused.*
- **Description:** Maintains the `IN_TRANSIT` status of the transfer order between LWD and joining. Computes admissible **joining time** (working days excluding holidays/weekends per calendar) from `joining_time_days`, monitors elapsed transit, flags overdue joinings, and exposes an in-transit register. Handles the pay-gap risk by ensuring pay-stop/pay-start bracket the transit and that overstayed transit is escalated.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Transfer orders display `IN_TRANSIT` with day counter and admissible-by date.
  2. Joining-time computation excludes configured holidays/weekends.
  3. Transit exceeding admissible joining time raises an overdue flag + notification to both offices.
  4. An in-transit register lists all employees currently in transit with source/destination and elapsed days.
- **Business Rules:** Transit is bounded by policy; extension of joining time requires Transfer Authority approval (recorded); unjoined beyond grace triggers `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW` (FR-TRJ-010).
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `relieving_orders`, `joining_reports`, holiday calendar (reference).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/in-transit?org_unit=&cursor=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/extend-joining-time` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** In-transit register with elapsed/limit progress bars; overdue rows highlighted; extension modal (Authority).
- **Edge Cases:** Holiday-calendar gaps; cross-region calendar differences; employee joins early; never joins (abandonment) → review/escalation.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `TransitService`, `JoiningTimeCalculator`, `InTransitRegister` |
  | Backend Flow | Derive admissible-by from LWD + working-day calc → scheduled job flags overdue → register query |

### FR-TRJ-010 — Joining Report & Charge Assumption at Destination
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Joining
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Transferee), HR Officer (Destination), Charge Receiving Officer, Payroll Officer
- **User Story:** *As a transferred employee, I want to submit a joining report at my destination and assume charge so that my joining date is confirmed, pay restarts, and my posting is updated.*
- **Description:** The transferee submits a `joining_report` (reported date, requested joining date/time); destination HR verifies, records charge assumption (`charge_handover` phase `ASSUMPTION_DEST`), confirms the statutory `joining_date`, computes transit vs admissible, signals **pay-start** to M10, updates the **employee master** (M01: org_unit, designation if promotion-linked, employment_status ACTIVE), posts the **joining SR event** (FR-TRJ-012), and sets the transfer order to `JOINED`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Joining report can be submitted only against an `IN_TRANSIT` order (exception: `JOINING_WITHOUT_RELIEF` flagged).
  2. Destination HR verification confirms `joining_date`; transit days and admissibility computed.
  3. On confirmation: charge assumption recorded, pay-start signalled, M01 posting updated, SR joining event posted, order → `JOINED`.
  4. Late joining (beyond admissible + grace) routes to `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW` with Authority decision before confirmation.
  5. Unique `joining_report_no` generated.
- **Business Rules:** Joining date ≥ LWD; M01 update is the single authoritative posting change; deputation joining also updates `deputation_records` start (FR-TRJ-011).
- **Data Model References:** `joining_reports`, `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `employees`(M01), `service_register_events`, `deputation_records`.
- **API References:**

  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/verify` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/confirm` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Joining wizard (report → charge assumption → confirm); HR verification screen with transit summary; late-joining banner with review action.
- **Edge Cases:** Reported but charge not available; joining before relieving processed at source; date disputes; promotion-linked designation change.
- **Low-Level Design:**

### FR-TRJ-011 — Deputation Terms & Repatriation Management
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Deputation & Repatriation
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority, Employee
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want to manage deputation tenure, terms, extensions and repatriation so that lent employees return on time and terms are tracked.*
- **Description:** For `DEPUTATION` transfers, maintains a `deputation_record` capturing borrowing/lending units (borrowing may be `EXTERNAL`), terms (pay protection, deputation allowance), tenure, extensions (with caps), repatriation due date and status. Generates repatriation alerts and processes repatriation as a reverse transfer (reusing FR-TRJ-004/006/008/010).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Deputation record auto-created when a deputation order is published.
  2. Extension requests validated against `max_tenure_months`; over-cap blocked.
  3. Repatriation-due alerts raised ahead of `current_end_date`.
  4. Repatriation initiates a reverse transfer order back to the lending unit.
- **Business Rules:** Deputation allowance/pay protection recorded in `deputation_terms`; external borrowing units modelled as `org_units` of type `EXTERNAL`; max tenure enforced by policy (FR-TRJ-002).
- **Data Model References:** `deputation_records`, `transfer_orders`, `org_units`, `employees`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/deputations?status=&cursor=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/deputations/{id}/extend` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/deputations/{id}/repatriate` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Deputation register with tenure timeline; extension modal with cap validation; repatriation action launching reverse-transfer wizard.
- **Edge Cases:** Extension beyond cap; early recall; deputee resigns on deputation; external unit not in org tree.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `DeputationService`, `RepatriationOrchestrator`, `DeputationRegister` |
  | Backend Flow | On deputation order publish create record → manage extensions (cap check) → on repatriate create reverse transfer order |

### FR-TRJ-012 — Service Register (SR) Event Posting
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · SR Posting
- **Primary Role(s):** System, SR Custodian/Registrar
- **User Story:** *As the SR custodian, I want every transfer, relieving and joining event reliably posted to the Digital SR so that the statutory service record is complete and accurate.*
- **Description:** Posts append-only `service_register_events` to M12 at three checkpoints: order publication (TRANSFER_ORDERED), relieving (RELIEVED), and joining (JOINED). Uses a transactional **outbox** for guaranteed delivery, idempotency keys to prevent duplicates, retry with backoff, and a reconciliation view for the SR Custodian to detect/resolve gaps.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Exactly one SR event per checkpoint per transfer order (idempotent).
  2. Failed postings are retried; persistent failures flagged `SR_PENDING` and surfaced to SR Custodian.
  3. SR event payload includes order_no, source/destination, dates, event type, and references.
  4. A reconciliation report lists transfer orders with missing/failed SR events.
- **Business Rules:** SR events are immutable (no edit/delete); corrections are new compensating events; posting failures never block local state but must be resolved before SR closure.
- **Data Model References:** `service_register_events`(M12), `transfer_orders`, `relieving_orders`, `joining_reports`, outbox table.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/sr/events` (M12 write) |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/sr-reconciliation?status=pending` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/sr-events/{id}/retry` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** SR reconciliation console listing pending/failed events with retry; per-order SR timeline.
- **Edge Cases:** M12 down at checkpoint; duplicate retry; partial payload; clock skew on event dates.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `SrOutboxWriter`, `SrPublisherJob`, `SrReconciliationService`, `M12Client` |
  | Backend Flow | On checkpoint write outbox row (same txn) → async publisher posts to M12 with idempotency key → mark delivered/failed → reconcile |
  | Data Operations | INSERT outbox; UPDATE delivery status; READ for reconciliation; `audit_log` |
  | Validation | Idempotency key uniqueness; payload schema |
  | Authorization | System publish; Custodian retry/reconcile |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Order `sr_status` flag; M12 ledger append |
  | Failure Handling | Exponential backoff; dead-letter after N tries → `SR_PENDING` flag + alert |
  | Dependencies | FR-TRJ-004/008/010, M12 |
  | Test Guidance | Idempotency under retry; outbox delivery guarantee; reconciliation accuracy |

### FR-TRJ-013 — Order Amendment, Cancellation & Post-Relief Revocation
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Amendment / Cancellation
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want to amend, cancel or revoke a transfer order at the correct lifecycle stage so that corrections and recalls are handled with full audit and statutory compensation.*
- **Description:** Supports three corrective actions with stage-aware rules: **amend** (before relieving — supersede with `revision_no`++, new PDF, re-post SR correction), **cancel** (before relieving — close order, reverse clearance/handover, notify), and **revoke** (after relieving and/or joining — recall requiring reverse SR events, possible reverse posting, pay reconciliation). All require Transfer Authority approval and recorded justification.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Amendment allowed only pre-relief; creates a new revision linked via `superseded_by_order_id`.
  2. Cancellation allowed pre-relief; reverses dependent clearance/handover records and notifies stakeholders.
  3. Revocation (post-relief/join) posts compensating SR events and triggers pay reconciliation signal to M10.
  4. Every corrective action requires justification and Authority approval; written to `audit_log`.
- **Business Rules:** Records already posted to SR are never hard-deleted (5.6-10); revocation after joining reverses the M01 posting via M01 API with reason.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `clearance_checklists`, `charge_handovers`, `joining_reports`, `service_register_events`, `employees`(M01).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/amend` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/cancel` |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Stage-aware action menu (only valid actions enabled); justification-required modal; impact preview listing reversals.
- **Edge Cases:** Amend after clearance started; cancel after partial clearance; revoke after pay already paid; concurrent amend + relieving.
- **Low-Level Design:**

### FR-TRJ-014 — Geographic Mapping & Transfer Analytics Dashboard
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Mapping & Analytics
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority, Auditor, Reporting Manager
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want a map and analytics view of transfers, pendency, clearance and transit so that I can monitor mobility health and act on bottlenecks.*
- **Description:** A dashboard with a geographic map of vacancies/postings (using `geo_lat/geo_lng`), and analytics: transfers by type/stage, relieving pendency, clearance bottlenecks by department, in-transit/overdue counts, SR posting health, drive progress, and deputation tenure alerts. Feeds M14 cross-module analytics.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Map renders vacancies/postings with filters by cadre, office, drive.
  2. KPI cards show counts for each lifecycle stage and overdue/pending items.
  3. Clearance bottleneck view ranks departments by average clearance time.
  4. All figures respect row-level org scope; Auditor sees all read-only.
  5. Data exportable (CSV/PDF) with pagination on underlying lists.
- **Business Rules:** Aggregations are read-only; no PII beyond role scope; numbers reconcile with operational records.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `relieving_orders`, `joining_reports`, `clearance_checklists/items`, `transfer_drives`, `vacancy_positions`, `deputation_records`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|

  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/analytics/clearance-bottlenecks` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/map/vacancies?cadre=&office=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Map panel + KPI grid + trend charts; drill-down from KPI to filtered list; export buttons.
- **Edge Cases:** Missing geo-coordinates (list-only fallback); large result sets (server aggregation + pagination); time-zone in trend buckets.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `AnalyticsService`, `MapDataService`, `TransferDashboard` |
  | Backend Flow | Pre-aggregated queries with org-scope filter → cache short TTL → serve KPI/map/bottleneck |

  | Validation | Filter params; scope enforcement |
  | Authorization | Scoped read; Auditor global read |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | None (read-only) |
  | Failure Handling | Cache miss/timeouts → degrade to live query with limit |

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data migration
- Import historical transfer/relieving/joining records from legacy registers into `transfer_orders`/`relieving_orders`/`joining_reports` with a `legacy_ref` tag; statuses normalised to terminal (`JOINED`/`CANCELLED`).
- Backfill in-flight transfers into the correct live state (e.g., relieved-but-not-joined → `IN_TRANSIT`).
- Seed `transfer_policy_rules`, `transfer_ban_periods`, office clearance-department configs, and order templates.
- Reconcile legacy SR entries with M12; post compensating events only where gaps exist (no duplicates).

### 13.2 Cutover & launch
- Dual-run period: legacy + HRMS for one transfer cycle; reconcile counts.
- Phased rollout: pilot offices → cadre-wise → org-wide; bulk-drive features enabled after pilot sign-off.
- Go/No-Go gates: SR posting health ≥ 99.9% in pilot; zero unresolved data-integrity exceptions; UAT sign-off by Transfer Authority + SR Custodian.
- Rollback: feature-flag disable of write paths; outbox drains before cutover; backups verified (RPO ≤ 15min).

### 13.3 Training & support
- Role-based guides (employee self-service, clearance officer, HR, authority).
- In-app contextual help on each wizard; SR reconciliation runbook for custodians.

### 14.2 Dependency / build order
1. **Foundation:** entity migrations, policy/ban seed, order templates.
2. **FR-TRJ-002** (eligibility engine) — prerequisite for 001/003/004.
3. **FR-TRJ-001** (request intake).
4. **FR-TRJ-012** (SR outbox) — prerequisite for 004/008/010 side effects.
5. **FR-TRJ-004** (orders) → **FR-TRJ-006** (clearance), **FR-TRJ-007** (handover).
6. **FR-TRJ-008** (relieving) → **FR-TRJ-009** (transit) → **FR-TRJ-010** (joining).
7. **FR-TRJ-003/005** (counselling/drives) layered on 002/004.
8. **FR-TRJ-011** (deputation), **FR-TRJ-013** (corrections), **FR-TRJ-014** (analytics) last.

### 14.3 Parallel-agent plan
| Agent | Owns FRs | Shared contracts to honour |
|---|---|---|
| Agent A (Intake & Policy) | FR-TRJ-001, 002 | request/eligibility API + enums |
| Agent B (Orders & Drives) | FR-TRJ-003, 004, 005 | order entity, order_no sequence, SR outbox client |
| Agent C (Relieving) | FR-TRJ-006, 007, 008 | clearance/handover/relieving entities, M10 signal client |
| Agent D (Transit & Joining) | FR-TRJ-009, 010 | M01 update client, M10 pay-start, SR client |
| Agent E (SR, Deputation, Corrections, Analytics) | FR-TRJ-011, 012, 013, 014 | SR outbox, reversal orchestrator, read models |

Shared interface contracts (entities §5, error catalog §8.2, state tables §10, SR outbox §FR-012) are frozen before parallel work to prevent drift.

| Relieving | Formal release of an employee from the source office after clearance and handover. |
| No-dues / clearance | Departmental certification (IT, Library, Accounts, Stores, Advances, Estate) that no dues/assets are outstanding. |
| Charge handover/assumption | Transfer of duties, records, assets and cash from relinquishing to receiving officer (source) and assumption at destination. |
| Last Working Day (LWD) | Final day of duty at source; basis for pay-stop and transit computation. |
| Joining report | Document by which a transferee reports and assumes duty at the destination, fixing the joining date. |
| Transit period | Time between LWD and joining date; bounded by admissible joining time. |
| Joining time | Statutorily admissible working days allowed to travel and join. |

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Sequence (happy path, narrative)
Request → eligibility pass → recommend → Authority approve → order_no + PDF → publish (SR TRANSFER_ORDERED, clearance created) → departments clear → handover accepted → relieving order + LWD (pay-stop, LPC, SR RELIEVED) → IN_TRANSIT (joining-time clock) → report at destination → charge assumption → confirm joining (pay-start, M01 update, SR JOINED).

### 16.2 Office clearance-department default config
IT, LIBRARY, ACCOUNTS, STORES, ADVANCES, ESTATE_QUARTERS, HR — configurable per office; an office may add `OTHER` named departments.

### 16.3 Outbox & idempotency note
External signals (M10 pay-stop/start, M12 SR, M01 posting) are written to a transactional outbox in the same DB transaction as the local state change and dispatched asynchronously with idempotency keys and exponential backoff; dead-lettered items surface in the SR Reconciliation Console (FR-TRJ-012).

### 16.4 Open configuration parameters
Minimum-tenure months, near-retirement protection window, cooling period, joining-time days by distance band, clearance SLA hours per department, deputation max tenure, drive preference window length — all System-Administrator-configurable master data with seeded defaults.
