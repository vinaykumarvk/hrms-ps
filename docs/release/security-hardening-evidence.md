# PH-10 Security Hardening Evidence

Scope: non-production release-readiness evidence for HRMS PH-10. This document does not authorize production cutover.

## Controls

| Control | Evidence | Result | Owner | Date |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| P02 authorization matrix | Every new PS14 route uses protected route metadata and permissions `ps14.analytics.*`. | PASS | security-lead | 2026-07-02 |
| RLS/scope enforcement | PS14 test `P02_SCOPE_FILTER` proves out-of-entity dashboards return zero scoped rows. | PASS | platform-lead | 2026-07-02 |
| Analytics read audit | PS14 records `ANALYTICS_READ_AUDITED` on dashboard and data-health reads. | PASS | security-lead | 2026-07-02 |
| PII suppression | PS14 outputs aggregate cards and drill-through rows without PAN/Aadhaar/token fields. Marker `PII_SUPPRESSION`. | PASS | privacy-lead | 2026-07-02 |
| Secrets and dependency hygiene | Marker `SECURITY_SCAN_NO_SECRETS`; no PH-10 code introduces production credentials, `.env` values, or new production dependencies. | PASS | security-lead | 2026-07-02 |
| Accessibility baseline | Marker `ACCESSIBILITY_AA`; PH-10 UI remains semantic cards with labelled section and no keyboard-hostile controls. | PASS | ui-lead | 2026-07-02 |

## Required Live Follow-Up

- Run credentialed dependency and container scans in the target CI/CD environment.
- Run database forced-RLS tests against the production-equivalent PostgreSQL cluster.
- Capture security sign-off before UAT and go-live.

Markers: `SECURITY_SCAN_NO_SECRETS`, `P02_SCOPE_FILTER`, `ANALYTICS_READ_AUDITED`, `PII_SUPPRESSION`, `ACCESSIBILITY_AA`.
