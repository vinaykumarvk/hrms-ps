# Contract-Coverage Baseline — 2026-07-03 (PH-37A)

**Tool:** `tools/contract-coverage.mjs` (run `node tools/contract-coverage.mjs`).
**Gate:** `docs/spec/pipeline/checks/ph-37a.sh` (recomputes independently; ratchet floor below).

This report replaces the hand-waved "implemented routes cover only a fraction of the **~1,306** OpenAPI
operations" caveat carried by every tranche verdict with a **measured, per-module metric**. The contract
enumerates **1,323** operations across `docs/contracts/openapi/*.yaml` (the ~1,306 figure quoted in prior
verdicts was an earlier approximate count; the tool's exact count is 1,323). Implemented kernel routes are
attributed to a module by `operationId` prefix.

## Coverage (count-based, per module)

| Module | Contract ops | Implemented routes | Coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| PS01 | 165 | 68 | 41.2% |
| PS02 | 65 | 31 | 47.7% |
| PS03 | 92 | 48 | 52.2% |
| PS04 | 45 | 21 | 46.7% |
| PS05 | 75 | 57 | 76% |
| PS06 | 86 | 38 | 44.2% |
| PS07 | 111 | 37 | 33.3% |
| PS08 | 133 | 40 | 30.1% |
| PS09 | 89 | 34 | 38.2% |
| PS10 | 87 | 43 | 49.4% |
| PS11 | 90 | 37 | 41.1% |
| PS12 | 65 | 38 | 58.5% |
| PS13 | 114 | 38 | 33.3% |
| PS14 | 90 | 26 | 28.9% |
| P01 | 16 | 14 | 87.5% |
| **Total** | **1323** | **570** | **43.1%** |

## Ratchet floor

The gate `ph-37a.sh` enforces **total coverage ≥ 43.1%** and **implemented routes ≥ 570**. Coverage can only
be raised by adding real, tested routes; deleting routes (dropping below the floor) fails the gate. When a
future tranche raises coverage, refresh this report and the floor together.

**Net-new phase (from PH-62A):** the route-exposure vein is exhausted; further ratchets now come from
**net-new implementations** (new service logic + backing + tests per contracted operation), not from wiring
existing engines. PH-62A added the FR-EPM-004 nominee register (new `NomineeService` + VAL-NOMINEE invariant).

PENDING; row_version lock; soft-delete), 6 operations).

## Honest limitation (what this metric is NOT)

This is **count-based** coverage per module — it compares the *number* of implemented routes to the *number*
of contract operations. It does **not** yet perform per-operation path matching (OpenAPI `{employeeId}` vs
kernel `{id}`), so it does not identify *which specific* operations are missing, and a module could in
principle implement routes outside its contracted set. Per-operation path reconciliation is the natural
follow-on (would let the gate assert that each of the ~392 implemented routes maps to a contracted op and
enumerate the exact backlog). The 29.6% figure is therefore a coverage *ceiling estimate*, honest and
tracked, not a per-path conformance proof.
