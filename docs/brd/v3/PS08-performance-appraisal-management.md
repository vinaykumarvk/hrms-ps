# Performance Appraisal Management — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS08, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Module code:** PS08 (alias `PS-M08`; supersedes `M08-PAM`) — see `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §B.
**Program:** PrimeSoft HRMS — a public-sector configuration and extension of the **PrimeSoft HRMS** platform (Vision §1.1), hosted at the CGG Data Centre / enterprise cloud (Standalone / Group-Company deployment model, Vision §1.4).
**Document version:** v3.0 (platform re-grounded on PrimeSoft Master BRD v2.1 · Vision v2.6 · Platform Spec v1.6 · RBAC v1.7 · Foundation FS v1.6).
**Status:** Approved for build, conditional on v3 amendments (platform-native, parallel-agent ready) — Phase-1 statutory core + Phase-2 flagged differentiators.
**Reconciliation amendment:** **v3.2** (2026-07-01) — Section 5 extended **ADD-only** to sync the BRD with the reconciled PS08 data model (`docs/data-model/08-PS08-performance-appraisal.sql`, RECON Sections 3–4). Adds 11 new PS08-owned config/data entities (E24–E34), new columns on `goals`/`self_appraisals`/`calibration_recommendations`/`performance_improvement_plans`, and new `ps08_*` enums — reconciled against the DarwinBox PMS CSV exports (`reconciliation/ps08-performance.md`) and the PrimeSoft prototype screens (`reconciliation/prototype-ps08-performance.md`). No existing E1–E23 content changed. See **Amendments (v3.1 → v3.2: field reconciliation)** below.
**Supersedes:** v2.0 (`/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/brd/v2/M08-performance-appraisal-management.md`) and v1.0.
**Relationship to platform:** **EXTEND of PrimeSoft `M09` Performance Management** (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A row PS08; Master BRD §4.10/§5.8). PrimeSoft **already ships** the appraisal-period configuration, goal plans (OKR — one active plan per employee, auto-opened 30 days before the prior plan ends), 12 monthly goal cycles + 12 monthly review cycles, self & manager review, skip-level & HR calibration, rating & contribution-level assignment, probation confirmation, PIP tracking and Multi-Source Feedback — governed by **`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM/DISTRIB/ACHV/GOALNAME`**, the **`JOB-M09-*`** job family and the **`MSG-M09-*`** notification templates. PS08 therefore **reuses the existing M09 goal/review/calibration/probation model** and **adds the public-sector statutory APAR layer on top**: the multi-tier **Reporting → Reviewing → Accepting** adjudication, **mandatory full disclosure**, **representation against adverse remarks**, the **Sealed Cover Procedure**, **multi-RO part-period reports + No-Report Certificate**, **digital-signature non-repudiation**, statutory **custody/retention**, and posting to the **PS12 Service Register ledger**. Every one of those extensions runs on the platform engines — workflow on **P01**, authz/confidentiality on **P02**, audit on **P05**, notifications on **X.2**, jobs on **X.1**, migration on **P06**, configured forms/flows on **W.1/W.2/W.3**.
**Grounding contract:** This BRD **consumes** the PrimeSoft platform contracts by id and **never re-authors** them (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §1, §9). Platform/M09 entities (`workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`, `audit_log`/`security_audit_log`, `notifications`, `documents`, `consent_records`, `integration_credentials`, `migration_runs`, `employees`/`org_units`/`roles`/`designations`/`contribution_levels`, **M09 `goal_plans`/`goals`/`review_cycles`/`review_templates`/`goal_plan_templates`/`calibration_sessions`/`performance_reviews`/PIP/MSF**) are **referenced/extended, not redefined**. Where the platform genuinely lacks a enterprise capability it is marked **`GAP (enterprise-specific)`** and authored here, still running on the named engines.

## Amendments (v3.1 → v3.2: field reconciliation)

*ADD-only sync of Section 5 to the reconciled PS08 data model. Every row below is a PS08-owned entity or column the schema now materialises that this BRD previously lacked. Source = ground-truth artefact (DarwinBox "DwnB Form Fields / Performance Management" CSV export, or PrimeSoft prototype screen). Schema ref = section in `08-PS08-performance-appraisal.sql`. Large per-field enable/mandatory/editable/need-approval matrices are NOT modelled as columns — they are stored as **config `jsonb`** (`field_settings` / `stage_settings` / `moderation_fields` / `parameters`), i.e. form-engine config consumed at runtime, not queryable business facts.*

**New entities (11):**

| # | Entity | Kind | Source (CSV export / prototype screen) | Schema ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E24 | `scorecard_pillars` | config master | `Scorecard Pillar.csv` | §3.1 |
| E25 | `metrics` | config master | `Metric.csv` | §3.2 |
| E26 | `normalization_settings` | config master | `Normalization.csv` | §3.3 |
| E27 | `custom_formula_settings` | config master | `CustomFormulaSettings-Export.csv` | §3.4 |
| E28 | `goal_plans` | config master | `GoalPlanKraSettings-Export.csv` | §3.5 |
| E29 | `review_definitions` | config master | `ReviewKraSettings-Export.csv` | §3.6 |
| E30 | `review_excluded_employees` | DATA | `Excluded-Employees-Export.csv` | §3.7 |
| E31 | `calibration_settings` | config master (template) | `Calibration(1/2).csv` | §3.8 |
| E32 | `performance_translations` | config i18n | `*Framework Translation` / `*Translation.csv` (5 exports) | §3.9 |
| E33 | `appraisal_cycle_exclusions` | DATA | prototype `pa-exclusions`, `pa-cycle-create` auto-exclusions | §4.6 |
| E34 | `probation_confirmations` | DATA | prototype `probation-confirmation` / `-decision` / `-approval` / `-management` | §4.7 |

**New / changed columns on existing entities:**

| Entity | Added columns | Source | Schema ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| `goals` (E5) | `metric_id`, `metric_criteria`, `target_prefix`, `timeline_start_date`, `timeline_end_date`, `scorecard_pillar_id`, `aligned_to_goal_id`, `aligned_to_ref`, `achievement_mapping`, `block_edit_achievement`, `assigned_to_roles`, `goal_plan_master_id` | `Goals-Export.csv` | §3.10 |
| `goals` (E5) | `goal_source`, `category`, `set_reason`, `goal_visibility` | prototype `add-goal` / `admin-add-goal` / `add-goal-for-reportee` / `review-goal-plan` | §4.2 |
| `self_appraisals` (E7) | `overall_comments`, `development_areas` | prototype `self-review` | §4.3 |
| `calibration_recommendations` (E21) | `potential_rating`, `employee_ack_status`, `employee_ack_comments`, `employee_ack_at` | prototype `calibration` (9-box + employee acknowledgement) | §4.4 |
| `performance_improvement_plans` (E16) | `pip_type`, `trigger_reason`, `checkin_cadence`, `support_plan`, `hrbp_id`, `next_review_date` | prototype `pa-pip` / `pip-cases` | §4.5 |

**New enums (8):** `ps08_config_status` (§3), plus `ps08_goal_source`, `ps08_calib_ack_status`, `ps08_exclusion_source`, `ps08_exclusion_reversibility`, `ps08_exclusion_status`, `ps08_probation_recommendation`, `ps08_probation_conf_status` (§4.1).

**Unchanged / note-as-config:** `appraisal_cycles` (E1) remains the Review-Cycle master; `rating_scales` (E3) the scale master; `calibration_sessions` (E14) the per-cycle calibration *run* (`calibration_settings` E31 is the reusable *template*); the review-scoped `review_excluded_employees` (E30) is distinct from the cycle-scoped `appraisal_cycle_exclusions` (E33); the terminal `appraisal_forms.probation_outcome` is retained, with `probation_confirmations` (E34) adding the decision lifecycle around it.

## Section 1 — Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

Performance Appraisal Management (**PS08**) is the system of engagement and adjudication for measuring, recording, moderating and certifying employee performance across an annual (and continuous) cycle, **built as a platform-native extension of PrimeSoft M09**. It unifies two worlds that enterprise HR has historically kept apart:

1. **Modern continuous performance management (CPM)** — OKR/KRA goal-setting, cascading objectives, real-time feedback, check-ins, Multi-Source (360) feedback, competency assessment, and calibration — **already provided by PrimeSoft M09** and reused here (goal plans, review cycles, `VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM`, `JOB-M09-PLAN-OPEN/REVIEW-OPEN/CALIB`, `MSG-M09-*`).
2. **The statutory APAR process** — a confidential, multi-tier adjudicated record authored by one or more **Reporting Officers** (over part-periods), scrutinised by a **Reviewing Officer**, certified by an **Accepting Authority**, with numeric grading, the integrity/attribute columns, the pen-picture, **mandatory full disclosure** to the officer reported upon, the right of **representation/appeal**, the **Sealed Cover Procedure**, **digitally-signed (DSC/eSign) non-repudiable** certification, and posting of the final grade to the **PS12 Digital Service Register** — authored here as the **enterprise-specific extension** running on **P01/P02/P05**.

### 1.2 What changed in v3 (platform re-grounding) and v2 (architecture)

**v3** re-anchors the module onto PrimeSoft: appraisal cycles, goal plans, review cycles, calibration and probation are **reconciled to the existing M09 model** (not forked); the APAR multi-tier workflow runs on the **P01 WorkflowEngine** (`SEQUENTIAL` + `DYNAMIC_APPROVER` patterns with reporting-chain approver resolution); confidentiality/field masking is the **P02 PII Protection Ceiling + field-mask-on-serialization**, not a bespoke projection; the invented per-form hash-chain is replaced by the **P05 dual-log DB-trigger audit substrate** plus the platform's proposed **OPEN-PLAT-03** hash-chaining-to-WORM; the invented error codes/envelope are replaced by the **platform 8-code table + `{error:{code,message,field,details}}` + `X-Correlation-Id`**; every entity carries **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`**; notifications ride **X.2/W.3**; migration runs on **P06**. The full v2→v3 delta is catalogued in **Amendments (v2 → v3)** after §16, and the FR→service map in **Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform**.

**v2** (preserved) resolved the council's highest-severity finding: the continuous-performance subsystem and the statutory-APAR subsystem are **separated and bridged by an immutable snapshot-on-lock**, not fused on one row; **calibration is a ratified recommendation** (committee recommends, authority ratifies with step-up + signature); **forced ranking is removed** (absolute grading); and named statutory procedures (Sealed Cover, multi-RO part-period + No-Report Certificate, auto-escalation, digital signature, tamper-evidence, apex-chain handling, probation confirmation, representation escalation ladder) are first-class.

### 1.3 Business outcomes

| Outcome | Measure |
|---|---|
| Timely cycle completion | ≥ 95% of APARs certified within the statutory calendar window |
| Goal alignment | ≥ 90% of employees with approved, weighted, cascaded goals before cycle mid-point |
| Procedural fairness | 100% of adverse remarks disclosed and substantiated by disclosable evidence; 100% of representations adjudicated within SLA |
| Defensible moderation | Every calibration recommendation carries a recorded rationale and an authority's ratification signature |
| Statutory integrity | 100% of final grades posted to the **PS12 SR ledger** as append-only events on the **P05** substrate |
| Non-repudiation | 100% of tier certifications, disclosure acknowledgements and expunctions carry a verifiable digital signature |
| Equity | DPDP-safe adverse-rate / below-benchmark disparity monitored by gender / cadre / region / RO across cycles (min-N suppressed) |
| Workforce insight | Real-time rating-distribution and skew analytics for every org unit, scoped by P02 |

### 1.4 Scope at a glance

In scope: appraisal-cycle configuration (**reusing M09 appraisal periods / review cycles / goal plans**); APAR templates as **W.2 form definitions**; goal/KRA/KPI/OKR management at employee×period with snapshot-on-lock (**reusing M09 `goals`/`goal_plans` + `VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM/ACHV/GOALNAME`**); self-appraisal (**M09 self review**); **multi-RO part-period APAR** three-tier workflow on **P01**; rating scales and numeric grade computation with explicit weightage-policy semantics; **mandatory full disclosure** and representation/appeal with an escalation ladder; **calibration as ratified recommendation** (**extends M09 calibration**, `VAL-DISTRIB` diagnostic-only); continuous feedback and check-ins (**M09 continuous manager feedback + two-way thread**); Multi-Source/360 feedback (**M09 MSF**); competency assessment with skill-gap → **PS07** training linkage; **Sealed Cover Procedure**; **SLA auto-escalation / authoring-right transfer** (**`JOB-M09-SLA`**); **digital signature / non-repudiation** (`GAP`, via X.3 eSign + P05); **probation confirmation appraisal** (**M09 probation + `JOB-M09-PROBATION`**); **cycle errata correction**; custody/confidentiality on **P05/OPEN-PLAT-03** with heir access; posting final ratings to **PS12** and feeding promotion eligibility to **PS06** by reference (suppressed under sealed cover); performance and bias-disparity analytics (feed **PS14**).

Out of scope (owned elsewhere / by the platform): the employee master (**PS01 / PrimeSoft M01**), training delivery (**PS07**), promotion decisioning (**PS06**), disciplinary proceedings (**PS09**), payroll/increment posting (**PS10**), the Service Register ledger itself (**PS12**, on P05), the document object store (**PS13 / PrimeSoft M11**), and **the workflow/RBAC/audit/notification/job/migration/configured-content engines themselves** (**P01/P02/P05/X.1/P06/W** — configured, never re-implemented).

### 1.5 Key design principles

- **Extend, don't fork.** Goal plans, review cycles, calibration, probation and PIP are the **existing PrimeSoft M09 entities**; PS08 adds the statutory APAR adjudication layer over them.
- **Two subsystems, one identity.** Continuous performance (open, employee-owned, cross-cycle) and the statutory APAR (closed, adjudicated, append-only) share identity and analytics but are bridged only by a one-way **snapshot-on-lock**. The legal record never live-references mutable goals.
- **Authority owns the grade, not the committee.** Calibration produces recommendations; only a competent grading authority mutates a certified grade, always with P02 step-up + digital signature.
- **Absolute grading.** Statutory grading is merit-based and absolute; `VAL-DISTRIB` target distributions are diagnostic only. Forced distribution is not supported.
- **Confidentiality by construction.** The **P02 PII Protection Ceiling** + **field-mask-on-serialization** strip fields the caller's tier/role may not see (fields *absent*, not greyed), with plain-language "why hidden" reasons; the platform read NFR (p95 < 500 ms) holds at 200k scale.
- **Append-only, audit-grade certification.** Certification and custody events are captured by the **P05 dual-log DB trigger** (immutable, 7-yr); statutory-grade tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** (hash-chain head to WORM), not a parallel invented mechanism.
- **Separation of duties + declared COI.** Maker ≠ checker at every tier, enforced by **P01/P02**; structural self/chain exclusion is extended to declared conflict-of-interest recusal.
- **Configurable, not hard-coded.** Scales, weightages, benchmarks, workflows (W.1), forms (W.2), disclosure timing, chain-truncation rules and retention are configuration, versioned per cycle (config cascade `platform → tenant → entity → employee`), correctable through a controlled errata path; in-flight instances pin their definition version (P01).

## Section 1A — Amendments (v1 → v2) *(preserved from v2)*

| # | Adopted improvement (Risk) | Incorporated in | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Calibration as ratified recommendation (R1) | E21 `calibration_recommendations`; FR-PS08-09; §10.5; RBAC; E15 requires `recommendation_id`+ratification | Committee recommends; AA/competent authority ratifies with step-up + DSC, or calibration runs pre-certification. No autonomous committee grade mutation. |

| 3 | Sealed Cover Procedure (R3) | FR-PS08-17; E4 `sealed_cover*`; state SEALED_COVER; PS09 boundary; FR-PS08-14 suppression | PS09 charge/sub-judice seals the form; finalisation blocked and PS06 feed suppressed until conclusion; release is signed. |
| 4 | Multi-RO part-period + "No Report Certificate" (R4) | FR-PS08-18; E19 `appraisal_report_periods`; E4 `has_multi_ro`; FR-PS08-04 aggregation; §5.6 | Per-period RO/grade/supervision-months; min-supervision triggers No-Report; supervision-weighted aggregation. |
| 5 | Natural-justice guard on adverse remarks (R5) | FR-PS08-04/05/06/08 BRs; `VAL-PS08-ADVEVID`; §5.6 rule 14 | An adverse/below-benchmark entry must cite disclosable evidence; anonymous MSF/restricted feedback cannot be the sole basis. |
| 6 | Decouple goals/OKRs from form; snapshot-on-lock (R6) | E5 (`form_id` nullable + cycle ownership); E20 `form_goal_snapshots`; FR-PS08-02; FR-PS08-07 roll-up | Goals live at employee×cycle on the M09 model; lock writes an immutable snapshot into the form; roll-up reads the snapshot. |
| 7 | Mandatory full-APAR disclosure (R7) | FR-PS08-08 BR1; §5.5 cycle config; §10.1 | Entire report incl. every grading disclosed to every officer; only channel/timing configurable, never *whether*. |
| 8 | Disclosure / representation clock clarity (R8) | FR-PS08-08; E4 `dispatched_at`,`representation_clock_start`,`representation_window_start_at` | Clock-start (dispatch vs ack) explicit per jurisdiction; both timestamps recorded; deemed-disclosure (`JOB-M09-AUTOACK`) still opens the window. |
| 9 | Auto-escalation on tier default (R9) | FR-PS08-19; §10.1; §11; **`JOB-M09-SLA`** | On missed RO/RvO/AA window, authoring right transfers or a "No Report due to RO/RvO" is recorded — not just a reminder. |
| 10 | Digital signature / non-repudiation (R10) | FR-PS08-20; E23 `digital_signatures` (`GAP`); E8/E18 refs; §9 | DSC/eSign (distinct from MFA) on certification, ack, ratification, expunction, No-Report, sealed-release, disposal — via X.3 provider + P05. |
| 11 | Engineer tamper-evidence (R11) | FR-PS08-15; E18; **P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03**; verify endpoint | Append-only ledger on the P05 substrate + OPEN-PLAT-03 hash-chaining-to-WORM + `/verify`; replaces the invented bare hash-chain. |
| 12 | Apex-officer chain handling (R12) | FR-PS08-01/05/06; E4 `chain_truncated`/`chain_config`; `VAL-PS08-CHAIN` | Configurable truncated-chain rule (designated alternates / single-tier); never a silent "all four distinct" failure. |
| 13 | Bias-disparity analytics (R13) | FR-PS08-16; §12 | DPDP-safe adverse/below-benchmark/grade-mean by gender/cadre/region/RO over time (min-N suppressed) + rater-leniency model. |
| 14 | Tier-projection performance gate (R14) | FR-PS08-15; §9; §13 GA gate | P02 field-mask serving from cache/pre-computed columns; platform read p95 < 500 ms at 200k load is a hard GA gate. |
| 15 | Deceased/heir custody + retention-vs-erasure (R15) | FR-PS08-15; event `HEIR_ACCESS`; §9 Retention | Legal-heir/nominee access path; statutory retention overrides DPDP erasure (P05 redaction-marker basis). |
| 16 | Phase the scope (R16) | §13.3; §14.3; §5.5 flags (RBAC §4.3) | Phase-1 GA = statutory core; continuous (FR-10), MSF/360 (FR-11), calibration (FR-09) capability-flagged Phase-2. |
| 17 | Plain-language role context + "why hidden" (R17) | §7.2/§7.3; FR-PS08-04/05/06; leak-prevention control | Workbench states each user's tier in plain language and shows a reason banner where P02 masks fields. |
| 18 | Cycle errata workflow (R18) | FR-PS08-22; §10.7; `ERR-PS08-ERRATA` | Controlled cycle-correction/re-derivation for config errors mid-cycle, audited and re-notified. |
| 19 | Probation appraisal semantics | FR-PS08-21; E1 probation fields; E4 `probation_outcome`; **`JOB-M09-PROBATION`** → PS01/PS12 | `PROBATION` cycle yields confirmation/extension outcome fed to PS01 + PS12, distinct from annual APAR. |
| 20 | Representation escalation ladder + external reference | FR-PS08-08; E13 `condonation_*`,`disposal_deadline_at`,`external_reference`,`escalation_level`; §10.3 | Statutory disposal deadline, condonation authority, external tribunal (CAT) handoff close the appeal chain. |
| 21 | Clarify weightage-policy semantics | FR-PS08-07; E2 `weightage_policy`; §5.6 rule 1; **`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM`** | DEVELOPMENT goals + competencies sit outside the 100% performance sum; goal-vs-competency split + roll-up formula defined. |
| 22 | Broaden COI / recusal | E22 `coi_recusals`; FR-PS08-09; §3 hard rule (P02) | Self/chain exclusion extended to declared COI with recorded recusal for adjudicators and calibration members. |
| 23 | Dual-control on irreversible actions | FR-PS08-15; `ERR-PS08-DUALCTRL`; §9 | Retention disposal and confidentiality downgrade require a second-person approval (P01 maker-checker) in addition to step-up. |

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from the platform, applied throughout)

- **Audit (P05):** every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE on a PS08 business table fires the **P05 DB trigger** writing one immutable `audit_log` row; auth/permission/admin events go to `security_audit_log`. Reading an APAR audit row is itself audited (P05). PS08 **does not define its own `audit_log`** (override per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C).
- **Workflow (P01):** APAR tier transitions, representation flow, calibration ratification, sealed-cover, errata maker-checker and auto-escalation run as **configured P01 flows** (`startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel`, each idempotent; `workflow_actions` not `workflow_tasks`; 5 patterns Appendix D; in-flight version pinning). PS08 supplies the state machines (§10) as flow definitions.
- **Authz + confidentiality (P02):** every query calls `Authorization.check`; APAR field confidentiality is the **PII Protection Ceiling + field mask on serialization** (FR-P02-002), so an over-broad query cannot leak a masked field; scoping across the five dimensions (reporting chain, `org_unit`, UAG, contribution level, entity); an unscoped query is **rejected, not defaulted to all**.
- **Documents (PS13):** supporting evidence, signed APAR PDFs, acknowledgements and signature artefacts reference platform `documents.document_id`.
- **Notifications (X.2 / W.3):** all task assignments, disclosures, escalations and deadlines resolve recipients via **W.3** and dispatch via **X.2** (IN_APP + EMAIL parallel; statutory notices mandatory/non-suppressible); templates by **`MSG-M09-*`** (reused) and module-unique **`MSG-PS08-*`**.
- **Service Register (PS12):** final grades, sealed-cover and adverse-remark events post to the **PS12 `service_register_events`** ledger on the **P05** substrate.
- **Pagination/idempotency/correlation:** **cursor only** (`?limit=` default 25/max 100 + `cursor=` → `next_cursor`); **`Idempotency-Key`** on unsafe POSTs (24h replay); **`X-Correlation-Id`** echoed and audited.
- **i18n / soft-delete / UTC:** UTC storage, `DD-MMM-YYYY` display; soft-delete `is_deleted` (append-only ledgers exempt); no hard delete (Platform §8.2).

| PS14 / PrimeSoft M16 Analytics | read | Rating-distribution and bias-disparity facts for cross-module dashboards |
| eSign/DSC provider | call (X.3) | DSC token / Aadhaar-eSign / HSM signing (FR-PS08-20); credentials from **P04 `integration_credentials`** |

### 2.4 Explicit exclusions

The module does **not** compute increments/pay (PS10), **not** decide promotions (only feeds eligibility to PS06 by reference), **not** run disciplinary inquiries (PS09 — it only consumes PS09 charge status to seal a cover), and **not** define the competency catalog (consumes PS07's). Forced-distribution / quota-driven grading is explicitly **out of scope**. It does **not** re-implement the workflow/RBAC/audit/notification/job/migration/configured-content engines (P01/P02/P05/X/P06/W).

## Section 3 — Roles & Permissions

### 3.1 Roles as RBAC v1.7 ADDITIONS (no parallel scheme)

The access-control **model** is owned by **RBAC v1.7**; PS08 expresses its actors as **existing roles + new enterprise roles + capability flags ADDED to the taxonomy** (RBAC §2.2/§4.3), enforced by **P02**. SoD (maker ≠ checker, no self-approval) is enforced by **P01/P02**, never re-implemented (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6; `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C). The APAR tier authorities are resolved at runtime by **P01 approver resolution** (reporting-chain position / named role / cost-centre head). Auditor maps to **Org-Admin read + read-only entitlement**; System Administrator maps to **Org Admin / Platform Super Admin**.

| PS08 actor | Expressed in RBAC v1.7 as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Officer Reported Upon (Appraisee) | existing **Employee** (RBAC §2.4) | Sets goals, self-appraises, views/represents APAR after disclosure. **Me** workspace. |
| Reporting Officer (RO) | existing **Manager L1** + P01 reporting-chain position; capability flag `ps08.reporting-officer` | First-tier appraiser over a **part-period**; approves goals, writes assessment, integrity/pen-picture, part-period grade. **My Team** workspace. |
| Reviewing Officer (RvO) | **Skip-level Manager / HOD** + new flag `ps08.reviewing-officer` | Second-tier; concurs/varies with recorded reasons. |
| Accepting Authority (AA) | **new role `ps08_accepting_authority`** (Appointing-Authority analogue, RBAC §2.2) | Final certifying authority; settles grade, ratifies calibration, triggers disclosure; signs with DSC. |
| Competent / Adjudicating Authority | **new role `ps08_competent_authority`** (senior to AA) | Adjudicates representations; may ratify calibration where designated; not in the appraisee's chain. |
| Condonation Authority | **capability flag `ps08.condonation`** | Authorises acceptance of a late representation. |
| Calibration Committee Member | **new flag `ps08.calibration-member`** on Performance Admin / HOD (extends M09 HR calibration) | Proposes/votes **recommendations**; never mutates a certified grade. |
| HR / APAR Cell Officer | existing **HR Admin** + **Performance Admin** (`performance_admin`, M09) | Administers cycles, custody, disclosure dispatch, representation routing, errata (non-adjudicating). **Admin** workspace. |
| APAR Custodian | **new role `ps08_apar_custodian`** (aligns with PS12 SR Custodian / Document Admin pattern) | Confidential custody, retention, expunction execution, heir-access grants. |
| Dual-Control Approver | **capability flag `ps08.dual-control`** (second custodian/HR) | Second-person approval for disposal and confidentiality downgrade (P01 checker). |
| Legal Heir / Nominee | **time-bound individual entitlement** (RBAC §3.2; external, scoped) | Time-boxed read access to a deceased/retired officer's APAR per statute. |
| Auditor (read-only) | **Org-Admin read + read-only entitlement** (RBAC §3.2; P05 query access) | Read APAR + audit log + chain-verify; no write. No parallel "Auditor" write role. |
| System Administrator | **Org Admin / Platform Super Admin** (RBAC §2.1) | Configures scales, templates (W.2), workflows (W.1), RBAC, chain-truncation, feature flags; no self-adjudication. |

**Capability flags to register in RBAC §4.3 (working-group process, RBAC §14):** `ps08.reporting-officer`, `ps08.reviewing-officer`, `ps08.condonation`, `ps08.calibration-member`, `ps08.dual-control`, `ps08.feature-flags`.

### 3.2 Permission matrix (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, D=Soft-Delete/Withdraw, A=Approve/Adjudicate, S=Sign, X=No access)

> Enforcement is by **P02 `Authorization.check`** (deny-by-default → role grant → multi-role INTERSECTION → individual entitlement → capability flag → **PII Protection Ceiling** → data-scope filter → **field mask on serialization**). The matrix is the **model input**, owned with RBAC; P02 enforces it.

| Capability | Appraisee | RO | RvO | AA | Competent Auth | Calib. Member | HR/APAR Cell | Custodian | Auditor | Sys Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Configure cycle / template (W.2) / scale / chain rules | X | X | X | X | X | X | C R U | R | R | C R U |

**Hard rule (SoD + COI, enforced by P01/P02).** A user holding multiple roles is blocked at `Authorization.check` from acting on an APAR where they are the appraisee, or any other tier in the same chain (self-adjudication and adjacent-tier conflict prevention; multi-role **intersection** = more restrictive wins). **In addition**, an adjudicating authority or calibration member with a declared conflict of interest (spouse / close relation / same direct prior posting / financial) must record a recusal (`E22 coi_recusals`) and is blocked from acting on that form. Multi-role callers receive the **lowest-privilege** field mask on serialization.

## Section 4 — Shared Platform Foundation (consumed, not redefined)

PS08 inherits the PrimeSoft platform contracts (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §4–§8) and the existing **M09 Performance** business model. It authors only the statutory APAR extension logic.

- **Frontend:** Behaviour/NFR specified here; physical stack (React/TS/Tailwind/shadcn) is an engineering choice within the platform's logical architecture (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C). WCAG 2.1 AA across screens; canonical UI-state standard (empty/loading/error/no-permission/partial-data; masked fields per RBAC; `E·AR` request-change) per Foundation §3.
- **API:** REST under **`/api/v1`**; **cursor pagination**; **`Idempotency-Key`**; **`X-Correlation-Id`**; **canonical error envelope `{error:{code,message,field,details}}`** with the **8-code standard table** (Foundation §1; §8 below). Endpoints never re-implement permission logic — they call **`Authorization.check`** (P02). Effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` (staged via `VAL-EFFECTIVE`).
- **Datastore:** PostgreSQL with **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`** on every table and data-layer scoping; object storage via **PS13**.
- **Auth/session:** Bearer JWT carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope (P02); **MFA enforced for high-privilege statutory roles** (AA, Competent Authority, Custodian) per Vision §2.2; **MFA step-up** authenticates the session and the **digital signature** binds the record (distinct controls).
- **Workflow:** **P01 WorkflowEngine** for all tier/representation/calibration/sealed-cover/errata/escalation flows; APAR multi-tier expressed as `SEQUENTIAL` with `DYNAMIC_APPROVER` reporting-chain resolution.
- **Authz/confidentiality:** **P02** — APAR CONFIDENTIAL content protected by the **PII Protection Ceiling + field-mask-on-serialization**; tier-aware visibility is a P02 field-mask, not a bespoke projection.
- **Audit:** **P05** dual-log, DB-trigger, immutable, ≥ 7-yr retention; statutory-grade tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** (hash-chain head to WORM) — PS08 invents no parallel mechanism.
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP ASVS L2; TLS 1.2+; encryption at rest; India DPDP Act 2023 alignment; APAR content classified **CONFIDENTIAL**; statutory retention overrides the DPDP erasure right (P05 redaction-marker basis recorded, FR-PS08-15).
- **Integration:** **X.3** for the eSign/DSC provider and any external anchoring; credentials from **P04 `integration_credentials`**; circuit-breaking, outbound idempotency, payload versioning.
- **Jobs:** **X.1** runner; PS08 **reuses `JOB-M09-PLAN-OPEN/REVIEW-OPEN/CALIB/CLOSE/NOTIFY/AUTOACK/PROBATION/SLA`** and registers module-unique **`JOB-PS08-*`** (SR posting, sealed-cover monitor, representation-disposal SLA, chain anchor).
- **Migration:** **P06** ETL+V — three staging dry runs, waves, `migration_runs`, **`gov_source_id`** traceability against the legacy APAR register.

**Platform/M09 entities referenced/extended (not redefined):** `employees`/`org_units`/`users`/`roles`/`designations`/`cadres`/`contribution_levels` (PS01/M01), `documents` (PS13), `notifications`, `consent_records`, `integration_credentials` (P04), `workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions` (P01), `audit_log`/`security_audit_log` (P05), `migration_runs` (P06), `service_register_events` (**PS12** on P05), and the **M09** `goal_plans`/`goals`/`goal_plan_templates`/`review_cycles`/`review_templates`/`performance_reviews`/`calibration_sessions`/PIP/MSF model.

---

## Section 5 — Holistic Data Model

### 5.0 Platform data-model conventions (apply to every PS08 entity)
- **`tenant_id`** (NOT NULL) and **`entity_id`** (NOT NULL where entity-scoped) on every PS08 business table; data-layer scoping per Platform §0.1 (unscoped query rejected, not defaulted to "all").
- Audit fields (`created_at`,`updated_at`,`created_by`,`updated_by`,`is_deleted`) on every non-ledger entity; append-only ledgers carry only `created_at`,`created_by`. **Mutations captured by the P05 DB trigger** — PS08 does not write audit rows in application code.
- **No locally-defined `audit_log`, `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks`, or `service_register_events`-as-platform-entity.** Consumed from **P05**, **P01 (`workflow_actions`)**, and the **PS12 ledger** respectively.
- Master/config records (templates as W.2 forms, scales) publish through a **P01 master-data approval flow**; `code` uniqueness uses **`VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`**.

### 5.1 Entity inventory

**Reused/extended (PrimeSoft M09 — referenced, not redefined):** `goal_plans`, `goals`, `goal_plan_templates`, `review_cycles`, `review_templates`, `performance_reviews` (self & manager), `calibration_sessions` (base), PIP tracking, MSF, continuous feedback + two-way thread, probation confirmation, `contribution_levels`.
**Reused (platform):** `employees`, `users`, `org_units`, `designations`, `cadres`, `roles`, `audit_log`/`security_audit_log` (P05), `documents` (PS13), `notifications` (X.2), `workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions` (P01), `service_register_events` (PS12), `migration_runs` (P06), `integration_credentials` (P04).

> **[v3.2] Config value sets (not enums).** Scale/pillar/metric/goal-plan/review/calibration-template codes are tenant-configurable **master rows** with tenant-scoped UNIQUE codes (CONVENTIONS §4 `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`), not Postgres enums. The giant per-field enable/mandatory/editable/need-approval matrices from the CSV exports are stored as **config `jsonb`** (`field_settings` / `stage_settings` / `moderation_fields` / `parameters`) consumed by the form engine — not enumerated here.

**Feature flags (R16), as RBAC §4.3 capability flags (Org-Admin-granted, audited to P05):** `ps08.calibration` (default off), `ps08.continuous-feedback` (default off), `ps08.msf-360` (default off), `ps08.bell-curve` (default off). Phase-1 GA runs with all four off; the statutory core path requires none.

### 5.6 Data integrity rules

1. **Weightage policy (R21).** Performance goals (KRA/KPI/OKR) at the same cascade level sum to 100 (±0.01) via **`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM`**; sub-goals via **`VAL-SUBWSUM`**; DEVELOPMENT goals excluded. The final grade roll-up applies `weightage_policy.goal_split_pct` to the goal score and `competency_split_pct` to the competency score (sum 100). Enforced on goal-lock and in `GradeRollupEngine`.
2. **Scale bounds.** Any grade within `[rating_scales.min_value, max_value]`.
3. **Achievement bounds.** `achievement_pct`/`progress_pct` validated by **`VAL-ACHV`** (0–cap per template).
4. **Adverse / benchmark derivation.** `is_adverse = final_grade < adverse_threshold`; `below_benchmark = final_grade < benchmark_grade`. Derived on certification, server-side; never client-supplied.
5. **Tier ordering (P01).** A REVIEWING assessment cannot exist before all REPORTING period assessments (E19) are SUBMITTED/NO_REPORT; ACCEPTING requires REVIEWING complete (or the configured truncated-chain path). Ordering is the P01 `SEQUENTIAL` flow.
6. **Self-adjudication + COI block (R22, P02).** `appraisee_id` ∉ {RO(s), RvO, AA, adjudicator, calibration member acting on the form}; all distinct. A declared COI (E22) blocks the actor even where the structural check passes (`Authorization.check` multi-role intersection).
7. **One self-appraisal.** Unique `(form_id)` on `self_appraisals`.
8. **One form per appraisee per cycle.** Unique `(tenant_id, cycle_id, appraisee_id)` on `appraisal_forms`.
9. **Disclosure precedence + mandatory disclosure (R7).** Every certified APAR **must** be disclosed in full; `representations` may be FILED only after `disclosed_at`/deemed-disclosure. No "non-disclosure for favourable" path.
10. **Representation clock (R8).** `representation_window_start_at` = `dispatched_at` or `acknowledged_at` per `cycle.representation_clock_start`; deemed-disclosure after `deemed_disclosure_days` (driven by **`JOB-M09-AUTOACK`**) sets the window start even without acknowledgement.
11. **Immutability after FINALISED.** No update to grade fields once status ≥ FINALISED except via representation or ratified expunction (new signature + P05 audit chain).
12. **Append-only ledgers + tamper-evidence (R11).** `apar_disclosure_log`, `form_goal_snapshots`, `digital_signatures` and PS12 `service_register_events` accept INSERT only; mutation audit is the **P05 DB trigger**; statutory tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** (chain head to WORM); `/verify` queries that chain.
13. **Calibration authority (R1).** A certified `final_grade` may change only through `calibration_adjustments` referencing a **RATIFIED** `calibration_recommendations` signed by AA/competent authority — or a pre-certification recommendation the AA certifies. No committee mutates a certified grade. Applying preserves `pre_calibration_grade` and sets `calibrated=true`.
14. **Confidentiality (R14, R17, P02).** Reading APAR content passes **`Authorization.check`** with the **PII ceiling + field mask on serialization**; denied reads append `ACCESS_DENIED` (and a `security_audit_log` row). The platform read NFR (p95 < 500 ms) holds at 200k scale via cached/pre-computed mask columns.
15. **Adverse-evidence substantiation (R5).** An adverse / below-benchmark assessment requires non-empty `adverse_evidence_refs` to **disclosable** evidence (**`VAL-PS08-ADVEVID`**); anonymous MSF (E12) and visibility-restricted continuous feedback (E10 PRIVATE/MANAGER_ONLY) cannot be the sole reference.
16. **Sealed cover (R3).** While `sealed_cover=true`, the form cannot transition to FINALISED/POSTED and the PS06 feed is suppressed; release requires a signed `SEALED_COVER_RELEASE` and a PS09 conclusion reference.
17. **Multi-RO aggregation (R4).** `provisional_grade` = supervision-weighted aggregate of report-period grades (E19) excluding NO_REPORT periods; a period with `supervision_months < cycle.min_supervision_months` (**`VAL-PS08-SUPV`**) is a No-Report Certificate.
18. **Digital signature (R10).** Tier certification, disclosure ack, calibration ratification, expunction, No-Report Certificate, sealed-cover release and disposal each require a VALID `digital_signatures` row (via X.3 provider) before the act commits.
19. **Dual-control (R23).** Disposal and confidentiality downgrade require a distinct maker and checker (two principals) plus MFA step-up and DSC — modelled as a **P01 maker-checker flow**.
20. **Chain truncation (R12).** When the resolved chain cannot satisfy "all distinct" (apex officers), the form adopts a configured `chain_config` (DESIGNATED_ALTERNATE / SINGLE_TIER) via **`VAL-PS08-CHAIN`**; otherwise materialisation flags `CHAIN_TRUNCATED_UNCONFIGURED` — never a silent failure.
21. **FK respect + soft delete.** All FKs enforced; soft delete via `is_deleted` (append-only ledgers exempt). No hard delete; cascade is logical for statutory records.

## Section 6 — Functional Requirements

> Each FR carries: ID, Module, Primary Role(s), User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Business Rules, Data Model References, API References, UI Behavior Notes, Edge Cases, and a Low-Level Design table. v3 re-grounds every FR onto P01/P02/P05, the `VAL-*`/`JOB-M09-*`/`MSG-*` ids, the platform error table, cursor pagination, `Idempotency-Key` and `tenant_id`/`entity_id`. FR-PS08-17 … FR-PS08-22 are the statutory extensions; FR-PS08-02/04/05/06/07/08/09/14/15/16 amend the M09 base.

---

### FR-PS08-01 — Appraisal Cycle & Template Configuration

- **Module:** PS08
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator, HR/APAR Cell (HR Admin + Performance Admin)
- **User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to configure an appraisal cycle with its calendar, eligible population, template (W.2 form), rating scale, disclosure-clock and chain-truncation rules so that the correct APAR/OKR process runs for the right employees with statutory deadlines.

**Description.** Create and manage `appraisal_cycles` bound to a published `appraisal_template` (a **W.2 form definition**) and `rating_scale`, **reusing the M09 review-cycle / goal-plan window** (opened by `JOB-M09-REVIEW-OPEN` / `JOB-M09-PLAN-OPEN`). Configure goal/self/RO/RvO/AA windows, eligibility (assignment-rule dimensions), disclosure channel and representation clock-start, minimum-supervision threshold, chain-truncation policy, and capability flags. Opening a cycle materialises one `appraisal_forms` per eligible employee with the RO/RvO/AA chain resolved via **P01 approver resolution** (reporting-chain position) and report periods seeded from supervision history.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. A cycle cannot move to OPEN unless `template_id` is PUBLISHED and `rating_scale_id` is ACTIVE.
2. Opening a cycle generates exactly one form per eligible employee (idempotent re-run via `Idempotency-Key` adds only newly eligible).
3. RO/RvO/AA are resolved from the M01 reporting chain at open (P01 resolution); unresolved chains are flagged, not silently dropped.
4. Eligibility filters by cadre/designation/min-service and excludes RETIRED/RESIGNED/DECEASED/TERMINATED `lifecycle_state`.
5. Calendar dates chronologically ordered and within the fiscal year (`VAL-DATE`, `VAL-EFFECTIVE`).
6. **(R12)** Where the resolved chain cannot satisfy "all distinct" (apex officers), the form adopts `chain_truncation_policy` (DESIGNATED_ALTERNATE / SINGLE_TIER) via `VAL-PS08-CHAIN`; if unconfigured, the form is flagged `CHAIN_TRUNCATED_UNCONFIGURED` (HTTP 412 `PRECONDITION_FAILED`) and held — never silently dropped.
7. **(R3)** Employees with an active PS09 charge/sub-judice status are materialised with `sealed_cover=true` (FR-PS08-17).

**Business Rules.**
- BR1: `goal_window_end ≤ appraisal_period_end`; `self_appraisal_due ≤ ro_due ≤ rvo_due ≤ aa_due`.
- BR2: A published template version is immutable (W.2 versioning); changes require a new version; in-flight forms pin their version (P01/§0.3).
- BR3: A cycle in IN_PROGRESS may not change scale/template (correctable only via FR-PS08-22 errata).
- BR4: `disclosure_channel` and `representation_clock_start` snapshot onto each form; disclosure itself is always mandatory (R7).
- BR5: Phase-1 cycles default `calibration_enabled=false`; enabling requires flag `ps08.calibration` (R16).

**Data Model References.** E1 (create/manage), E2 (bind PUBLISHED W.2), E3 (bind ACTIVE), E4 (bulk materialise), E19 (seed), `employees`/`org_units` (read chain/eligibility), M09 `review_cycles`/`goal_plans` (bind).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/cycles` · `PUT /api/v1/ps08/cycles/{cycleId}` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/cycles/{cycleId}/open` (Idempotency-Key) · `GET /api/v1/ps08/cycles?limit=&cursor=` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/templates` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/rating-scales`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Wizard: Basics → Calendar → Eligibility → Template/Scale → Disclosure & Clock → Chain Rules → Review. Eligibility preview shows live count, unresolved-chain/apex-truncation warnings, and sealed-cover count before open. Open is a guarded action with a generated-forms summary. Empty/loading/error/no-permission states per Foundation §3.

**Edge Cases.** Mid-cycle joiners (incremental materialise); no-RO (flag); circular reporting (`VAL-FLOW-NOCYCLE`); apex officer (truncation policy or hold); template retired after binding (block); duplicate open (idempotent); employee under charge (sealed).

### FR-PS08-02 — Goal / Objective Setting (employee×period, cascading, weightages, snapshot-on-lock)

- **Module:** PS08
- **Primary Role(s):** Appraisee, Reporting Officer
- **User Story:** As an officer, I want to set weighted KRAs/KPIs aligned to my reporting officer's objectives — even before a form opens and across cycles — so my appraisal is measured against agreed, cascaded goals, while the statutory record stays immutable.

**Description.** Goals are the **M09 `goals` within the employee's active `goal_plan`** (E5); they may be drafted before a form exists (`form_id` null) and span cycles (`period_scope=CROSS_CYCLE`). ROs review/return/approve. On **goal-lock**, the system writes an **immutable snapshot** (E20) of approved goals into the statutory form; thereafter the roll-up reads the snapshot, not the live goal. Weightage is governed by **`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM`** (perf siblings sum 100, DEVELOPMENT excluded), sub-goals by **`VAL-SUBWSUM`**, names by **`VAL-GOALNAME`**.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. A goal can be owned by an appraisee with no form yet (`form_id` null) and optionally `cycle_id` null for cross-cycle objectives. **(R6)**
2. Sibling APPROVED performance goals sum to 100% before goal-lock via `VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM`; DEVELOPMENT excluded. **(R21)**
3. A goal may cascade from an RO/skip-level goal (`parent_goal_id`/`cascaded_from_employee_id`); `VAL-FLOW-NOCYCLE` prevents cascade cycles.
4. RO can return a goal with comments (PROPOSED→DRAFT); appraisee resubmits.
5. **Goal-lock writes an immutable `form_goal_snapshots` row per approved goal** and transitions GOALS_PENDING→GOALS_APPROVED; the snapshot is append-only. **(R6)**
6. Post-lock changes to the live goal do not alter the snapshot; a re-snapshot occurs only through a controlled re-lock (audited via P05).

**Business Rules.**
- BR1: Weightage ∈ (0,100]; performance total = 100 ±0.01; DEVELOPMENT outside the sum.
- BR2: Only RO may APPROVE; appraisee cannot self-approve (P02 SoD).
- BR3: Revisions after lock require RO approval + reason (`ERR-REASON-REQ`); statutory roll-up uses the snapshot until a controlled re-lock.
- BR4: DROPPED goals excluded from weightage sum and roll-up.
- BR5: The statutory form never live-references E5; it references E20 only.

**Data Model References.** E5 (M09 goals create/approve/revise), E20 (immutable copy), E4 (status transition), `employees` (cascade source), M09 `goal_plans` (owning plan).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/goals` (form-less allowed) · `PUT /api/v1/ps08/goals/{goalId}` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/goals/{goalId}/approve` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/goals/{goalId}/return` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/goals/lock` (Idempotency-Key) · `GET /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/goal-snapshots?limit=&cursor=`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Goal board with weightage meter (running total of performance goals, red until 100; DEVELOPMENT shown separately as "outside sum"). Cascade picker shows RO/skip-level goals. "Carry forward / cross-cycle" toggle. Lock shows a snapshot-preview confirming the immutable statutory record.

**Edge Cases.** Weight ≠ 100 at lock (block with delta); DEVELOPMENT counted (excluded); cascade parent dropped (warn); cross-cycle objective in two forms (each its own snapshot); concurrent edits (optimistic lock `updated_at` / `If-Match`); appraisee edits snapshot (forbidden).

|---|---|
| Components | `GoalService` (M09), `WeightageValidator` (`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM`), `CascadeResolver`, `GoalLockService`, `SnapshotWriter` |
| Backend Flow | CRUD goals (form-less ok) → RO approve/return → lock validates perf sum + all-approved → write E20 in txn → transition form |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE E5; INSERT E20 (append-only); UPDATE E4.status; P05 captures |
| Validation | `VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM/GOALNAME`, transition legality, role check, optimistic lock |
| Authorization | P02: appraisee own goals; RO on reports; org-scoped |
| State Changes | goal DRAFT↔PROPOSED→APPROVED→REVISED; form GOALS_PENDING→GOALS_APPROVED; notify |
| Failure Handling | Lock fails with `VALIDATION_FAILED` (weightage delta); snapshot atomic with transition |
| Dependencies | FR-PS08-01, M09 goal model, PS01 chain |
| Test Guidance | Unit: weightage sum (dev excluded), transition matrix. Integration: form-less drafting, cross-cycle, snapshot immutability, re-lock audit |

### FR-PS08-03 — Self-Appraisal Submission

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Appraisee
- **User Story:** As an officer, I want to record my achievements, self-ratings and constraints so the appraising officers have my account of the year.

**Description.** Appraisee completes the **M09 self review** (E7): achievement narrative, per-goal self-ratings/achievement % (`VAL-ACHV`), competency self-ratings, constraints, training needs. Submission locks self-edit and advances the form to RO_ASSESSMENT. RO may RETURN before assessing.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Submittable only when form is SELF_APPRAISAL and goals are APPROVED (snapshot exists).
2. Achievements narrative mandatory (`VAL-REQUIRED`); per-goal self-ratings within scale bounds.
3. Submission timestamps `submitted_at`, sets SUBMITTED, advances form to RO_ASSESSMENT.
4. RO can RETURN (→SELF_APPRAISAL) with comments; appraisee resubmits.
5. After RO begins assessment, the self-appraisal is read-only to the appraisee.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Exactly one self-appraisal per form. BR2: Self-ratings advisory; do not auto-populate RO grades. BR3: Missing self-appraisal at RO due date allows RO to proceed with a recorded flag.

**Data Model References.** E7 (create/submit), E20 (per-goal self rating vs frozen goals), E4 (status transition).

**API References.** `GET/PUT /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/self-appraisal` · `POST .../self-appraisal/submit` · `POST .../self-appraisal/return`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Tabbed form (Summary / Goals / Competencies / Constraints & Needs). Autosave drafts. Submit confirmation summarising goals and self-grades. Read-only after RO start.

**Edge Cases.** Submit before goals approved (forbidden, 412); rating out of bounds (reject); resubmit after return; deadline passed (RO override → FR-PS08-19 escalation).

**LLD.**
| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SelfAppraisalService` (M09 review), `ScaleValidator`, `FormTransitionService` |
| Backend Flow | Upsert draft → validate on submit → transition form → notify RO (X.2) |

| Failure Handling | OOB → `VALIDATION_FAILED` field-level; return preserves draft |
| Dependencies | FR-PS08-02 |
| Test Guidance | Unit: bounds, single-per-form. Integration: submit/return loop, no-submission override |

### FR-PS08-04 — Reporting Officer Assessment (APAR Tier 1, multi-RO aware, digitally signed)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Reporting Officer
- **User Story:** As a reporting officer, I want to assess my subordinate's goals and competencies for the period I supervised, certify integrity, write the pen-picture and assign a part-period grade, signed with my DSC, so the APAR can proceed to review.

**Description.** Each RO records section/goal grades, competency assessed-levels, the statutory **integrity** certification, the **pen-picture**, and a part-period grade scoped to their `appraisal_report_periods` row (E19). Submission is a **P01 approve action** that creates a REPORTING `appraisal_assessments` row, **requires a DSC/eSign signature (E23)**, and — once all periods are SUBMITTED/NO_REPORT — aggregates (supervision-weighted) to `provisional_grade` and advances to RVO_REVIEW. An adverse part-period grade must cite disclosable evidence (`VAL-PS08-ADVEVID`).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Integrity certification mandatory; if not BEYOND_DOUBT, `integrity_remark` required.
2. Pen-picture meets `penpicture_min_words` if configured.
3. Part-period grade within scale bounds; section grades roll up per `weightage_policy`.
4. Submission writes a REPORTING assessment with a valid `signature_id` (R10); when all periods complete, supervision-weighted aggregate sets `provisional_grade` and advances to RVO_REVIEW. **(R4)**
5. RO may RETURN the self-appraisal before assessing.
6. **(R5)** An adverse/below-benchmark part-period grade requires non-empty `adverse_evidence_refs` to disclosable evidence; anonymous MSF / restricted feedback cannot be the sole basis.

**Business Rules.** BR1: An RO may assess only their assigned period(s); cannot be the appraisee (P02 SoD). BR2: Adverse provisional grade requires disclosable-evidence substantiation. BR3: CRITICAL/MODERATE competency gaps flag for FR-PS08-12 nomination. BR4: RO assessment immutable after RvO begins (anchored by the DSC + P05). BR5: A period below `min_supervision_months` is a No-Report Certificate (FR-PS08-18).

**Data Model References.** E8 (create REPORTING per period), E19 (period scope/aggregation), E23 (DSC), E4 (integrity/pen_picture/provisional/adverse_refs/status), E9 (competency), E20 (ro_rating vs frozen goals).

**API References.** `GET /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/assessment/reporting?periodId=` · `PUT .../assessment/reporting` · `POST .../assessment/reporting/submit` (Idempotency-Key; P01 approve)

**UI Behavior Notes.** Plain-language tier banner: "You are the Reporting Officer for period 1 (Apr–Oct). You may grade and comment." (R17) Split view: appraisee self-input vs RO input.

### FR-PS08-05 — Reviewing Officer Review (APAR Tier 2)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Reviewing Officer
- **User Story:** As a reviewing officer, I want to concur with or vary the reporting officer's assessment with recorded reasons, signed with my DSC, so the APAR reflects a second, independent scrutiny.

**Description.** RvO views all RO part-period assessments, concurs (carries the aggregated grade forward) or varies (sets `reviewed_grade` with mandatory `variance_reason`), may add remarks, and signs. Completing (P01 approve) advances to AA_ACCEPTANCE. RvO may RETURN to RO (P01 sendBack).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. RvO records `concurs_with_lower_tier`; if false, `variance_reason` and `reviewed_grade` required (`ERR-REASON-REQ`).
2. `reviewed_grade` within scale bounds.
3. Completion writes REVIEWING assessment with a valid DSC and advances to AA_ACCEPTANCE.
4. RvO may RETURN to RO (→RO_ASSESSMENT) with comments.
5. RvO cannot be any RO or the appraisee; declared COI triggers recusal (R22) — enforced by P02 + E22.
6. **(R5)** A downward variance crossing the adverse threshold must include substantiating disclosable evidence.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Downward variance crossing adverse threshold needs remarks + evidence. BR2: RvO review immutable after AA begins (DSC + P05). BR3: **(R12)** If RO and RvO collapse by org structure, `chain_truncation_policy` designates an alternate or records SINGLE_TIER/NO_RVO — escalation, never silent collapse.

**Data Model References.** E8 (create REVIEWING), E23 (DSC), E22 (recusal), E4 (reviewed_grade/status).

**API References.** `GET/PUT /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/assessment/reviewing` · `POST .../assessment/reviewing/submit` · `POST .../assessment/reviewing/return` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/recuse`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Plain-language banner: "You are the Reviewing Officer. You may agree or change the grade with a reason." (R17) RO part-period assessments shown read-only beside RvO input. Concur toggle reveals variance fields. Grade-delta indicator. COI "declare conflict / recuse" action. DSC sign on submit.

**Edge Cases.** RvO == any RO (block, require alternate/truncation config); variance without reason/evidence (block); RvO acts after AA started (forbidden); COI declared (recuse, route to alternate); RvO unresponsive (FR-PS08-19).

### FR-PS08-06 — Accepting Authority Acceptance (APAR Tier 3, digitally signed)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Accepting Authority
- **User Story:** As the accepting authority, I want to settle the final grade and certify the APAR with MFA step-up and my DSC so it can be disclosed and posted to the service register — and, where calibration ran, ratify or decline the committee's recommendation.

**Description.** AA reviews RO (per-period) and RvO assessments, settles `final_grade` (reason if differing from `reviewed_grade`), and certifies with **P02 MFA step-up + DSC**. Certification derives `final_grade_label`, `is_adverse`, `below_benchmark`, writes an ACCEPTING assessment (CERTIFIED) with `certification_signature_id`, maps the grade to the M09 `contribution_level`, and advances to DISCLOSURE (or certifies a pre-certification calibration recommendation; post-certification recommendations require explicit ratification — FR-PS08-09).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. AA settles `final_grade` within scale bounds; deviation from `reviewed_grade` requires reason.
2. Certification derives label/adverse/benchmark flags server-side (never client).
3. Certification requires **MFA step-up AND a valid DSC** (`certification_signature_id` set) (R10).
4. AA cannot be any RO, RvO or appraisee; declared COI triggers recusal (R22).
5. Once certified, grade fields immutable except via **ratified** calibration (R1) or representation.
6. **(R1)** A certified grade is never mutated by a committee; only the AA/competent authority ratifying a recommendation (with DSC) may change it.
7. **(R7)** After certification the form proceeds to mandatory DISCLOSURE; there is no non-disclosure branch.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Adverse final grade mandates the disclosure path and substantiating disclosable evidence across tiers. BR2: AA certification is a guarded P01 action requiring step-up + DSC. BR3: AA may RETURN to RvO once with reasons. BR4: **(R3)** A form with `sealed_cover=true` cannot be certified to FINALISED/POSTED; it parks in SEALED_COVER (FR-PS08-17).

**Data Model References.** E8 (ACCEPTING CERTIFIED), E23 (AA DSC), E21 (ratify pre/post-cert), E4 (final_grade/flags/signature/status), E3 (derive label/flags + contribution-level map).

**API References.** `GET/PUT /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/assessment/accepting` · `POST .../assessment/accepting/certify` (Idempotency-Key; step-up) · `POST .../assessment/accepting/return`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Plain-language banner stating AA authority. Multi-column compare (RO periods / RvO / AA). Final-grade input bounded by scale; deviation reason on change. If a calibration recommendation exists, a "ratify / decline with reason" panel. Certify requires MFA step-up then DSC signing ceremony. Post-certify badges (adverse/benchmark). Sealed-cover forms show a locked "Sealed — cannot certify" banner.

**Edge Cases.** AA deviates downward to adverse (force evidence + disclosure); pre-cert recommendation present (certify recommended value); sealed cover active (block certify); DSC/step-up fail (abort); COI declared (recuse).

### FR-PS08-07 — Rating Scales & Numeric Grade Computation (explicit weightage policy)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (config), all assessors (consume)
- **User Story:** As an administrator, I want configurable rating scales with benchmark/adverse thresholds and a deterministic, well-specified grade roll-up so every grade is computed consistently and defensibly.

**Description.** Defines `rating_scales` (numeric range, ordered bands, benchmark/adverse thresholds, precision, contribution-level map) and the deterministic roll-up. **The weightage policy is explicit (R21):** performance goals sum to 100 (`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM`); DEVELOPMENT goals sit outside; competencies score separately; final grade = `goal_split_pct × goal_score + competency_split_pct × competency_score` (splits sum 100). The roll-up reads the **frozen `form_goal_snapshots`** (E20), not live goals.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Grade bands contiguous, non-overlapping, covering `[min,max]`.
2. **Goal score** = Σ(snapshot_goal_score × snapshot_weightage)/100 over performance goals; **competency score** per template; **final** = goal_split·goalScore + comp_split·compScore, rounded to `decimal_places`. **(R21)**
3. `label` resolved from bands; `benchmark_grade`/`adverse_threshold` produce `below_benchmark`/`is_adverse`.
4. Scales in use by an active cycle are RETIRE-locked, not edited.
5. The same roll-up function is the single source used by RO/RvO/AA stages and analytics.
6. DEVELOPMENT goals never contribute to the performance sum or the final numeric grade.

**Business Rules.** BR1: `min < max`; `adverse_threshold ≤ benchmark_grade ≤ max`; `goal_split_pct + competency_split_pct = 100`. BR2: Changing a scale/policy requires a new ACTIVE version; historical forms keep their original via snapshot. BR3: Rounding half-up at scale precision; documented.

**Data Model References.** E3 (define/retire), E2 (weightage_policy), E20 (frozen weights/scores), E4 (grade fields/labels/flags), E8 (section/overall grades).

**API References.** `POST/PUT /api/v1/ps08/rating-scales` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/rating-scales?limit=&cursor=` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/grade/preview`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Scale builder with band editor validating contiguity. Weightage-policy editor showing the goal/competency split and an explicit "DEVELOPMENT goals are outside the 100% sum" note. Grade preview reused across all assessment stages.

**Edge Cases.** Overlapping bands (block); boundary grade (inclusive-lower); zero-weight goals (excluded); split ≠ 100 (block); precision mismatch (single function enforces); DEVELOPMENT weighted >0 (warn).

### FR-PS08-08 — Mandatory Disclosure & Representation / Appeal (with escalation ladder)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** HR/APAR Cell, Appraisee, Accepting/Competent/Condonation Authority
- **User Story:** As an officer, I want the **entire** APAR disclosed to me with a clear appeal clock, and a complete representation ladder up to an external tribunal, so the process is fair, transparent and statutorily compliant.

**Description.** After certification, HR discloses the **full** APAR — every grading and remark — to the appraisee (R7). The system records `dispatched_at` and (on eSign acknowledgement) `acknowledged_at`; the representation window starts per `representation_clock_start` and deemed-disclosure (`JOB-M09-AUTOACK`) still opens the window (R8). The appraisee may file a `representation` within the window; late filings require condonation. A competent authority (senior to AA, not in chain, no COI) adjudicates within `disposal_deadline_at` (`JOB-PS08-REP-SLA`). Outcomes: UPHELD / PARTIALLY_UPHELD / REJECTED / EXPUNGED / MODIFIED / ESCALATED_EXTERNAL. A rejected representation may escalate to an external tribunal (CAT). Expunction/modification updates the final grade via a DSC-signed path and re-discloses. The whole flow runs on **P01**.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. **(R7)** The entire report is disclosed to every officer — no favourable-non-disclosure option. Disclosure transitions to DISCLOSED, sets `dispatched_at`/`disclosed_at`, appends DISPATCHED+DISCLOSED to `apar_disclosure_log`, notifies appraisee (X.2).
2. **(R8)** `representation_window_start_at` = dispatch or acknowledgement per cycle config; non-ack after `deemed_disclosure_days` sets deemed-disclosure and still starts the window. Both timestamps recorded.
3. Representation filed within the window; late filings set `is_late=true` and require condonation by the Condonation Authority. **(R20)**
4. Adjudication records decision/authority/reason within `disposal_deadline_at`; MODIFIED sets `revised_grade`; EXPUNGED nullifies the adverse remark and recomputes flags; both require a DSC.
5. **(R20)** A REJECTED representation can be ESCALATED (escalation_level++) and, for an external tribunal, `external_reference` (CAT/HIGH_COURT/TRIBUNAL) + `external_ref_no` recorded; status ESCALATED — the chain is closed, not dangling.
6. Every disclosure/view/download/denied access recorded in `apar_disclosure_log` (P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03).

**Business Rules.** BR1: Disclosure mandatory; only channel/timing configurable. BR2: A representation may contest only items present in the disclosed APAR. BR3: The adjudicating authority must be senior to AA, not in the chain, free of COI (P02). BR4: Post-adjudication the form returns to FINALISED with a new DSC-signed grade snapshot; prior grade preserved. BR5: An adverse remark resting on undisclosed/anonymous material is re-examined against the disclosable-evidence rule; unsubstantiated adverse remarks are expunged.

**Data Model References.** E13 (file/adjudicate/escalate/condone), E4 (clock/flags), E18 (append events), E23 (adjudication/expunction signature), `documents` (PS13).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/disclose` · `POST .../acknowledge` · `POST .../representations` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/representations/{repId}/condone` · `POST .../decide` · `POST .../escalate` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/disclosure-log?limit=&cursor=`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Disclosure viewer with watermark + eSign acknowledge; a clear "your representation window: opens DD-MMM-YYYY (from dispatch), closes DD-MMM-YYYY" banner (R8). Representation form with item-pickers tied to disclosed remarks and document upload. Adjudication console for competent authority with DSC. Condonation panel. Escalation action capturing external tribunal reference. SLA + disposal-deadline countdown badges.

**Edge Cases.** Late representation (condonation); deemed-disclosure on non-ack (window opens, logged); EXPUNGED grade crossing back above benchmark (recompute eligibility feed FR-PS08-14); multiple representations (sequence; second blocked until first decided); REJECTED → external CAT (status ESCALATED); adjudicator with COI (recuse).

### FR-PS08-09 — Calibration / Normalisation as a Ratified Recommendation (Phase-2, flagged)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Calibration Committee Member, Accepting/Competent Authority, HR/APAR Cell
- **User Story:** As a calibration committee, we want to surface comparability and outliers across a population and **recommend** grade changes that a competent authority ratifies — so ratings are fair and comparable without any committee unlawfully overriding a certified grade.

**Description.** (Flag `ps08.calibration`, Phase-2.) HR convenes an **M09 `calibration_session`** (E14) over an org-scoped population (P02) using **COMMITTEE_REVIEW or NORMALISATION** (BELL_CURVE only if `ps08.bell-curve`; **FORCED_DISTRIBUTION removed**, R2). Grading is **absolute**; `target_distribution` (`VAL-DISTRIB`) is **diagnostic-only**. The committee produces `calibration_recommendations` (proposed grade + mandatory rationale + vote). **A certified `final_grade` changes only when the AA/competent authority ratifies with MFA step-up + DSC** (creating a `calibration_adjustments` row), or — if `runs_before_certification` — the AA certifies the recommended value (R1). Members with self/chain/COI on a form cannot vote (R22).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Only forms within scope and at/after RvO (pre-cert) or certified (post-cert ratification) enter a session.
2. Every recommendation requires a non-empty `rationale`; the committee never writes `final_grade`. **(R1)**
3. Distribution view shows current vs target as **diagnostic only** (`VAL-DISTRIB`); no action enforces a quota. **(R2)**
4. A certified grade changes only via a RATIFIED recommendation → `calibration_adjustments` signed by AA/competent authority, preserving `pre_calibration_grade` and recomputing flags. **(R1)**
5. A member who is RO/RvO/AA/appraisee for a form, or with declared COI, cannot vote (recusal recorded). **(R22)**
6. `FORCED_DISTRIBUTION` unavailable; `BELL_CURVE` disabled by default. **(R2)**

**Business Rules.** BR1: Calibration produces recommendations only; the legal grade mutation is always an authority's signed act. BR2: Magnitude beyond a configured threshold requires committee quorum. BR3: A downward recommendation crossing the adverse threshold must cite disclosable evidence and, on ratification, forces the disclosure path. BR4: Target distributions are diagnostic; the system must not auto-apply or pressure grades.

**Data Model References.** E14 (M09 session), E21 (propose/vote), E15 (applied after ratification), E22 (recusal), E23 (ratification DSC), E4 (grades/flags).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/calibration/sessions` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/calibration/sessions/{id}/distribution` (diagnostic) · `POST .../recommendations` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/calibration/recommendations/{id}/vote` · `POST .../ratify` (step-up) · `POST .../decline`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Distribution histogram (current vs target) labelled "diagnostic — not a quota". Recommendation cards with mandatory rationale and committee vote. A separate **Ratification** screen for the AA/competent authority ("Ratify (sign) / Decline (reason)"). COI "recuse" control. No drag-to-quota interaction.

**Edge Cases.** Borderline adverse/below-benchmark (recompute on ratification); member self/chain/COI (exclude vote, record recusal); session cancelled after partial ratifications (applied stay); empty population (block); AA declines (no grade change, logged); bell-curve flag off (method unavailable).

### FR-PS08-10 — Continuous Feedback & Check-Ins (Phase-2, flagged)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Appraisee, Reporting Officer
- **User Story:** As a manager and employee, we want lightweight, year-round feedback and goal check-ins so the appraisal is grounded in continuous evidence rather than recency bias.

**Description.** (Flag `ps08.continuous-feedback`, Phase-2.) Reuses **M09 continuous manager feedback + two-way thread**. Authenticated users record `continuous_feedback` on a subject with controlled visibility, optionally linked to a goal (employee×period). Appraisees and ROs log `goal_checkins` with progress %. These surface as evidence during RO assessment — but **visibility-restricted feedback cannot be the sole basis of an adverse remark** (R5).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Feedback respects `visibility` (P02 field mask); PRIVATE_TO_SUBJECT hidden from the manager and vice-versa.
2. Check-ins update goal progress/timeline; do not change the final rating automatically.
3. Feedback/check-ins surfaced (read-only) in RO assessment, **labelled by disclosability** (R5).
4. Subject can acknowledge feedback (two-way thread reply via `parent_feedback_id`).
5. Feedback immutable after acknowledgement except by author within an edit window.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Continuous feedback authors are named (no anonymity); MSF anonymity is separate (FR-PS08-11). BR2: No deletion of constructive feedback to manipulate the record (soft-delete only, P05 audited). BR3: Check-in progress is advisory evidence. BR4: MANAGER_ONLY / PRIVATE feedback is non-disclosable and cannot be the sole adverse reference.

**Data Model References.** E10 (create/acknowledge/thread), E6 (create), E5 (progress linkage).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/feedback` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/feedback?subjectId=&limit=&cursor=` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/feedback/{id}/acknowledge` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/goals/{goalId}/checkins`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Feedback feed on employee profile; visibility selector with clear labels and a "disclosable?" indicator. Goal timeline with check-in markers. RO assessment evidence panel distinguishing disclosable items.

**Edge Cases.** Visibility downgrade after creation (P05 audited); feedback on inactive employee (block); check-in progress > 100 (`VAL-ACHV` clamp); cross-org feedback (P02 scope check); cite restricted feedback as sole adverse basis (block at FR-04).

### FR-PS08-11 — Multi-Source / 360-Degree Feedback (Phase-2, flagged)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** HR/APAR Cell, Reporting Officer, Raters
- **User Story:** As an organisation, we want multi-rater (peer/subordinate/customer) feedback so appraisals capture a rounded view — without anonymous input ever becoming the sole basis of an adverse statutory remark.

**Description.** (Flag `ps08.msf-360`, Phase-2.) Reuses **M09 Multi-Source Feedback**. For eligible forms, HR/RO nominate raters across relationships. Raters submit `feedback_360_responses` (per-competency scores + qualitative). Responses aggregate respecting anonymity and minimum-N suppression and surface as input to RO assessment. **Anonymous MSF cannot be the sole basis of an adverse/below-benchmark remark** (R5).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Raters nominated with a relationship type; the appraisee cannot rate themselves.
2. Anonymous responses aggregated only when ≥ minimum-N raters of that relationship responded.
3. A rater submits exactly one response per request; declines/expiries tracked.
4. Aggregated view read-only evidence in RO assessment; individual anonymous responses never attributable; **a MSF aggregate alone cannot substantiate an adverse entry** (R5).
5. MSF windows align to cycle dates.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Minimum-N (default 3) protects anonymity; below-N buckets show "insufficient responses". BR2: External raters use a scoped, time-boxed access token (no full system access). BR3: MSF informs but does not directly set the APAR grade and cannot be the sole adverse basis.

**Data Model References.** E11 (nominate/track), E12 (submit/aggregate), E9 (optional input).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/360/requests` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/360/requests/assigned?limit=&cursor=` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/360/requests/{id}/respond` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/360/summary`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Nomination grid by relationship. Rater questionnaire (mobile-friendly). Summary radar/bar with anonymity-suppressed buckets clearly labelled. RO view marks MSF as "non-disclosable — supporting only, not sole adverse basis".

**Edge Cases.** Fewer than N respond (suppress); rater leaves org mid-window (expire); duplicate submission (block); external token expiry (deny clearly); base adverse remark solely on MSF (block at FR-04).

### FR-PS08-12 — Competency Assessment & Skill-Gap → Training Linkage (PS07)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Reporting Officer, Appraisee, HR
- **User Story:** As a reporting officer, I want to assess competencies against role-required levels and turn gaps into training nominations so development is closed-loop with the training module.

**Description.** Using the **PS07** competency catalog and role-required levels (snapshotted onto the form), the RO assesses each competency's `assessed_level`; the system derives `gap` and `gap_severity`. MODERATE/CRITICAL gaps generate training nominations to **PS07** (linking `training_nomination_id`) via the platform service-contract convention. The competency score feeds the final grade per `weightage_policy` (FR-PS08-07).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Competencies and required levels are read from PS07 (snapshotted onto the form for historical fidelity).
2. `gap = required_level − assessed_level`; severity per configurable bands.
3. MODERATE/CRITICAL gaps offer a one-click "nominate to training" creating a PS07 nomination and storing its ID.
4. Self competency ratings display alongside RO assessed levels.
5. Closed nominations reflect status back on the competency assessment view.

**Business Rules.** BR1: A nomination is created only with an active PS07 training mapped to the competency; otherwise a development-need is logged (and may feed the PS07 Gap Contract). BR2: Competency assessment is part of the RO stage and locks with it (RO DSC). BR3: Required levels come from the role/designation profile in PS07; ad-hoc overrides recorded with reason.

**Data Model References.** E9 (assess/derive gap), PS07 competency catalog (read), PS07 nominations (write by id), E7 (self levels).

**API References.** `GET/PUT /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/competencies` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/competencies/{id}/nominate`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Competency grid: required vs self vs assessed, gap badge (colour by severity), nominate button on gaps. Nomination status chip after creation.

**Edge Cases.** No training mapped to a critical gap (log development-need); PS07 unavailable (queue via X.3 outbound retry); negative gap (over-competent → no nomination); catalog changed after snapshot (use snapshot).

### FR-PS08-13 — Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Reporting Officer, Reviewing Officer, HR
- **User Story:** As a reporting officer, I want to place an underperforming officer on a structured improvement plan with milestones and a fair outcome so improvement is supported and documented.

**Description.** Reuses **M09 PIP tracking**. For below-benchmark/adverse outcomes (or ad hoc), RO initiates a `performance_improvement_plan` with reason, period, success criteria and `pip_milestones`. Progress is tracked; the plan concludes with an outcome. PIP records are CONFIDENTIAL (P02) and P05-audited; an unsuccessful PIP can be referenced by PS06/PS09 per policy.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. A PIP requires reason, start/target dates, success criteria and ≥1 milestone.
2. Milestones track status with progress notes.
3. RvO concurrence required to activate a PIP (SoD via P01 maker-checker).
4. Closing a PIP requires an outcome and summary; outcome is P05-auditable.
5. An active PIP is visible to appraisee, RO, RvO and HR only (P02 mask).

**Business Rules.** BR1: A PIP linked to an APAR references the originating `form_id`. BR2: An EXTENDED outcome creates a successor PIP linked to the prior. BR3: PIP existence does not by itself change an APAR grade.

**Data Model References.** E16 (create/close), E17 (track), E4 (optional origin link).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/pips` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/pips/{id}/activate` · `PUT /api/v1/ps08/pips/{id}/milestones/{mid}` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/pips/{id}/close` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/pips?employeeId=&limit=&cursor=`

**UI Behavior Notes.** PIP wizard (reason → criteria → milestones → review). Milestone board with status chips. Activation gated on RvO concurrence. Outcome modal on close.

**Edge Cases.** Activation without RvO concurrence (block); employee transferred during PIP (custody handoff to new RO); overlapping active PIPs (block second); abandoned due to long leave (record reason).

### FR-PS08-14 — Posting Final Ratings to PS12 SR Ledger & Promotion Eligibility Feed (PS06)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** HR/APAR Cell, APAR Custodian (trigger); System (post)
- **User Story:** As HR, I want certified final grades posted to the statutory Service Register (PS12) and promotion eligibility fed to PS06 — except where a sealed cover suppresses the feed — so the appraisal becomes part of the permanent record and informs progression lawfully.

**Description.** On finalisation (post-disclosure, representation window closed/decided, **not sealed**), the system appends an event to the **PS12 Service Register** ledger and feeds promotion eligibility to **PS06 by reference**. PS08 does **not** write the ledger directly: the module-local `…/post-to-sr` action is an **internal façade that relays to the canonical PS12 write-port `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (REMEDIATION D1; PS12 FR-02). PS08 never targets `/api/v1/sr/events` and never INSERTs `service_register_events` itself — the row is persisted by PS12 on the **P05** substrate. **While `sealed_cover=true`, the PS06 feed is suppressed** (R3). Posting is idempotent (`Idempotency-Key`), transactional with outbox semantics over X.3, and immutable once posted. A grade modified by representation post-posting creates a corrective event, never an edit. Driven by `JOB-PS08-SR-POST`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. A form posts only when status is FINALISED, representation resolved, and **`sealed_cover=false`** (R3).
2. The SR event is append-only and idempotent; **dedup is the PS12 canonical syntactic tuple `(source_module, source_reference_id, source_event_version)`** with `source_module="PS08"` and `source_reference_id=form_id` (replacing the prior per-`form_id`-only dedup); the HTTP `Idempotency-Key` header may carry a writer-local hash but the persisted tuple is the contract (REMEDIATION D1; PS12 FR-01). The event cites the exact PS12-published `event_type_code` **`APAR_FINAL_GRADE`** with `event_category=APPRAISAL`. Re-posts are no-ops (`CONFLICT`/`ERR-PS08-ALREADYPOSTED` or 200 no-op); the event references the disclosure-log chain anchor for verifiability (OPEN-PLAT-03).
3. The PS06 eligibility feed carries `below_benchmark`/`final_grade`/`cycle_id` **by reference**; **suppressed while sealed**; updated by corrective event if a representation later modifies the grade (never silent overwrite).
4. Posting sets `posted_to_sr=true` and appends to `apar_disclosure_log`.
5. If PS12/PS06 are unavailable, posting is queued (X.3 outbound + dead-letter) and retried; no data loss.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Posting is the only sanctioned write of appraisal outcome to PS12 from PS08. BR2: A grade modified by representation post-posting creates a corrective SR event referencing the original (`VAL-SR-EVENT` integrity), not an edit. BR3: Promotion decisioning remains with PS06; PS08 only feeds eligibility evidence. BR4: **(R3)** Sealed-cover forms never feed PS06; on release (FR-PS08-17) the feed is (re)evaluated per the disciplinary outcome.

**Data Model References.** E4 (finalise + posted flag + sealed gate), `service_register_events` (PS12, append), PS06 eligibility (write by reference), E18 (log posting).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/finalise` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/post-to-sr` (Idempotency-Key; **internal façade — relays to canonical `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`**, PS12 FR-02) · `GET /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/posting-status`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Finalise action with checklist (disclosed, representation resolved, not sealed). Posting status panel showing SR event id, chain anchor, and PS06 feed status (or "suppressed — sealed cover"); retry indicator if queued.

**Edge Cases.** Sealed cover active (block post + suppress PS06); representation decided after posting (corrective event); PS12 down (X.3 outbox retry); duplicate post (idempotent no-op); grade unchanged after representation (no corrective event).

### FR-PS08-15 — Custody, Confidentiality, Tamper-Evidence & Access Control of APAR

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** APAR Custodian, Dual-Control Approver, HR/APAR Cell, Legal Heir/Nominee, Auditor
- **User Story:** As the APAR custodian, I want every access to confidential APARs controlled and provably untampered, with custody transferable on officer movement, heir access on death, and dual-control on irreversible actions, so confidentiality and statutory custody obligations are met and auditable.

**Description.** Enforces field-level confidentiality through the **P02 PII Protection Ceiling + field-mask-on-serialization** (fields *absent*, not greyed, with plain-language "why hidden" reasons, R17) served from cache/pre-computed mask columns to hold the platform read NFR (p95 < 500 ms) at 200k scale (R14). Logs all access to `apar_disclosure_log`; the authoritative mutation audit is the **P05 DB trigger** (dual log), and statutory tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** (chain head to WORM) with a `/verify` endpoint (R11). Supports custody transfer on movement (PS05), **legal-heir/nominee access on death/retirement** (R15), retention per statutory schedule (overriding the DPDP erasure right via the P05 redaction-marker basis, R15), and **dual-control** (P01 maker+checker) on disposal and confidentiality downgrade (R23). Generated APAR PDFs are watermarked and encrypted in PS13.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Reading any APAR content passes `Authorization.check` (P02); unauthorised reads return `FORBIDDEN`, append ACCESS_DENIED (+ `security_audit_log`); absent fields carry a reason code. **(R17)**
2. Every successful view/download appends VIEWED/DOWNLOADED with actor/role/IP/timestamp; the **P05** trigger records the immutable audit row. **(R11)**
3. **(R11)** A `/verify` endpoint queries the OPEN-PLAT-03 chain over the form's P05 events and confirms (or fails) integrity; chain heads are anchored to WORM on a schedule (ANCHOR events).
4. Custody transfer reassigns custodian and logs CUSTODY_TRANSFER without altering content; orphaned custody is escalated, never dropped.
5. **(R15)** On death/retirement, a legal-heir/nominee access path grants time-boxed read (HEIR_ACCESS logged) via a time-bound individual entitlement (RBAC §3.2); statutory retention overrides any DPDP erasure (legal basis recorded).
6. APAR PDFs are watermarked (recipient + timestamp) and encrypted at rest in PS13.
7. **(R23)** Retention disposal and confidentiality downgrade require a distinct maker and checker (P01) plus MFA step-up and DSC; single-person attempts blocked.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Confidentiality class CONFIDENTIAL by default; downgrade requires dual-control + authority + reason + DSC. BR2: Auditor has read + log + verify but cannot mutate. BR3: **(R11)** Access ledger is append-only; tamper-evidence is P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03, verifiable not asserted. BR4: Custody follows the officer's service record; orphaned custody escalated. BR5: **(R14)** Field-mask serving must meet p95 < 500 ms at 200k via caching/pre-computation — a GA gate. BR6: **(R15)** Statutory retention overrides the DPDP erasure right; erasure requests against in-retention APARs are recorded and refused with the legal basis.

**Data Model References.** E18 (append access/custody events), E23 (disposal/downgrade signature), E4 (confidentiality_class, custodian), `documents` (PS13 encrypted PDF), `audit_log`/`security_audit_log` (P05).

**API References.** `GET /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}` (P02 masked) · `GET .../pdf` · `POST .../custody-transfer` · `GET .../access-log?limit=&cursor=` · `GET .../access-log/verify` · `POST .../heir-access` · `POST .../dispose` (maker) · `POST .../dispose/approve` (checker) · `POST .../downgrade` (maker+checker)

**UI Behavior Notes.** Content rendered through P02 mask — absent fields show a plain-language reason banner (R17). PDF viewer with watermark. Access-log table for custodian/auditor with a "Verify integrity" button (R11). Custody-transfer dialog. Heir-access grant workflow. Disposal/downgrade require a second approver (dual-control) plus step-up + DSC.

**Edge Cases.** Multi-role caller (lowest-privilege mask via intersection); transfer to office with no custodian (escalate); disposal before retention end (block); disposal single-person (block — `ERR-PS08-DUALCTRL`); erasure request during retention (refuse with legal basis); heir access for unverified claimant (block); chain mismatch on verify (raise `ERR-PS08-TAMPER`, alert auditor).

### FR-PS08-16 — Performance & Bias-Disparity Analytics

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** HR/APAR Cell, Dept Head/AA, Auditor (read), feeds PS14
- **User Story:** As HR leadership, I want analytics on rating distribution, skew, completion, skill gaps **and equity (bias-disparity)** so I can detect bias, monitor progress and meet the enterprise's equity obligation.

**Description.** Provides aggregated, **P02-scoped** analytics: rating distribution vs target (pre/post calibration), grading skew by RO/org unit, cycle completion funnel, adverse/representation rates, competency-gap heatmaps, MSF participation, and **DPDP-safe bias-disparity analytics**: adverse-rate, below-benchmark-rate and grade-mean by **gender / cadre / region / RO over time**, plus a **rater-leniency / central-tendency model across cycles** (R13). All analytics are de-identified aggregates with minimum-N suppression; datamarts feed **PS14**.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. Distribution charts show pre- vs post-calibration and current vs target (diagnostic).
2. Skew detection flags ROs/units deviating beyond a configurable threshold.
3. **(R13)** A bias-disparity view reports adverse-rate / below-benchmark-rate / grade-mean by gender/cadre/region/RO over time, with min-N suppression, and a cross-cycle rater-leniency/central-tendency model.
4. Aggregates honour minimum-N suppression; no drill-down to individual APAR content beyond P02 authorization.
5. Analytics endpoints are cursor-paginated/bounded and cached with freshness ≤ 15 min.

**Business Rules.** BR1: P02 scoping restricts each caller's analytics to their authorised population. BR2: Individual-level data exposed only to those already authorised to view that APAR. BR3: PS14 consumes only the aggregated, suppressed facts. BR4: **(R13)** Protected-attribute disparity metrics computed only on aggregates ≥ min-N; never expose individual protected attributes (PII ceiling).

**Data Model References.** E4 (grades/flags/status), E15/E21 (pre/post comparison), E9 (gap heatmaps), E11/E12 (MSF participation), `employees` (protected-attribute aggregates).

**API References.** `GET /api/v1/ps08/analytics/distribution` · `.../skew` · `.../completion` · `.../competency-gaps` · `.../bias-disparity` · `.../rater-leniency` (all cursor-paginated, P02-scoped)

**UI Behavior Notes.** Dashboard: distribution histogram, skew table with flags, completion funnel, gap heatmap, **bias-disparity panel** (adverse-rate by gender/cadre/region/RO over time, suppressed below min-N) and **rater-leniency model**. Filters by cycle/org/cadre. Export respects authorization and suppression.

**Edge Cases.** Small populations (suppress); mid-cycle (partial data labelled provisional); calibration not run (post = pre); unauthorised drill-down (denied); protected-attribute bucket below min-N (suppressed).

### FR-PS08-17 — Sealed Cover Procedure (statutory)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** HR/APAR Cell, Accepting/Competent Authority, APAR Custodian; driven by PS09
- **User Story:** As HR, when an officer is under charge or whose promotion is sub judice, I want the APAR finalisation and the promotion-eligibility feed kept in a sealed cover until the proceeding concludes.

**Description.** When **PS09** signals an active charge / sub-judice status, the form is placed in **SEALED_COVER**: assessments may be recorded but the form cannot transition to FINALISED/POSTED and the PS06 feed is suppressed (FR-PS08-14). On PS09 conclusion, the Competent Authority releases the sealed cover with a **DSC-signed** release referencing the PS09 outcome; the form proceeds or is acted upon per the disciplinary result. Monitored by `JOB-PS08-SEAL-MONITOR`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. An active PS09 charge/sub-judice sets `sealed_cover=true`, `sealed_cover_reason`, `sealed_cover_case_ref`, `sealed_at`, status SEALED_COVER; appends SEALED to `apar_disclosure_log`.
2. While sealed, transitions to FINALISED/POSTED are blocked and the PS06 feed is suppressed.
3. Release requires a PS09 conclusion reference and a signed `SEALED_COVER_RELEASE` (E23); appends UNSEALED; sets `sealed_released_at`.
4. On release, the form resumes its lifecycle; eligibility is (re)evaluated per the disciplinary outcome.
5. Sealing/unsealing is P05-auditable and notified (X.2) to HR, AA and custodian.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Only the Competent Authority (not the appraisee's RO/RvO) may release a sealed cover, signed. BR2: A sealed form's grade may still be assessed/certified into a held state but never posted while sealed. BR3: Sealed-cover status is CONFIDENTIAL and P02-masked like all APAR content.

**Data Model References.** E4 (sealed_cover*, status), E18 (SEALED/UNSEALED), E23 (release signature), PS09 (read/subscribe).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/seal` · `POST .../seal/release` · `GET .../seal-status`

**UI Behavior Notes.** A prominent "Sealed Cover — finalisation and eligibility feed suppressed" banner with case reference. Release dialog requires PS09 conclusion reference + DSC. Custodian/HR see a sealed-cover queue.

**Edge Cases.** Charge raised after certification but before posting (seal, block post); concluded favourably (release, resume feed); concluded adversely (release, act per PS09); PS09 status flapping (idempotent seal/keep-sealed).

### FR-PS08-18 — Multi-RO Part-Period Reports & "No Report Certificate" (statutory)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** HR/APAR Cell, Reporting Officer(s)
- **User Story:** As HR, I want to represent that an officer had 2–3 reporting officers across the year, each writing a part-period report, with a "No Report Certificate" where supervision was below the minimum, and a correct aggregation to the final grade.

**Description.** Each appraisal year is divided into `appraisal_report_periods` (E19), one per RO. Each RO grades only their period (FR-PS08-04). A period with `supervision_months < cycle.min_supervision_months` (`VAL-PS08-SUPV`) yields a **No-Report Certificate** (DSC-signed), not a grade. Part-period grades aggregate (supervision-weighted) into `provisional_grade`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. HR (or the chain resolver) can define multiple report periods per form with non-overlapping ranges (`VAL-PS08-PERIODTILE`) covering the appraisal period.
2. Each period resolves an RO and `supervision_months`; `has_multi_ro=true` when >1 period.
3. A period below the threshold is `no_report_certificate=true` with reason and DSC-signed No-Report Certificate; excluded from aggregation.
4. `provisional_grade` = supervision-weighted mean of valid period grades, computed deterministically; `weight_in_aggregate` recorded.
5. The form advances to RVO_REVIEW only when every period is SUBMITTED or NO_REPORT.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Periods must tile the appraisal period without gaps/overlaps (gaps explicitly flagged unsupervised). BR2: A No-Report period carries no grade/weight; the certificate is DSC-signed. BR3: An RO change mid-year (transfer per PS05) closes the current period and opens the next. BR4: Aggregation is the single deterministic function reused by analytics.

**Data Model References.** E19 (define/grade/aggregate), E8 (REPORTING per period), E23 (No-Report signature), E4 (has_multi_ro, provisional_grade).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/report-periods` · `PUT .../report-periods/{periodId}` · `POST .../report-periods/{periodId}/no-report` · `POST .../report-periods/aggregate`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Timeline of report periods with RO, dates, supervision months, status. "Issue No-Report Certificate" action (DSC) on short periods. Aggregation preview showing supervision-weighted provisional grade.

**Edge Cases.** Gaps between periods (flag unsupervised); overlapping (block); all periods No-Report (form flagged "No Report for the year"); single RO whole year (one period, has_multi_ro=false); RO transferred mid-period (split).

- **User Story:** As HR, when an RO/RvO/AA fails to act within the statutory window, I want authoring right to transfer automatically to the next higher authority (or a "No Report due to RO/RvO" recorded), so a single non-responsive officer cannot stall the cycle.

**Description.** The **P01 SLA runtime + `JOB-M09-SLA`** monitor tier due dates. On a missed window (beyond reminder grace), it **transfers the authoring right** to the next higher authority per service rule (P01 delegate/reassign), or records a "No Report due to RO/RvO" (a No-Report Certificate at the relevant tier), and notifies all parties (X.2). Escalated assessments are marked `is_escalated_author=true` and still require a DSC.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. The engine sends reminders before due; on overdue beyond grace it triggers escalation, not just another reminder.
2. Escalation transfers the authoring task to the next higher authority (RO→RvO, RvO→AA, AA→competent authority) per the cycle's escalation config; the act is logged and notified.
3. Alternatively, where service rule prescribes, a "No Report due to RO/RvO" is recorded (DSC-signed No-Report at that tier) and the flow continues.
4. An escalated assessment sets `is_escalated_author=true` and still requires a valid DSC.
5. Escalation events are P05-auditable and appear on the cycle SLA dashboard.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Escalation respects SoD and COI (P02) — the transferee cannot be the appraisee or conflicted. BR2: Only one active authoring right per tier at a time (transfer revokes the prior). BR3: Escalation thresholds (grace days) and the ladder are cycle configuration.

**Data Model References.** E8 (is_escalated_author, signature), E19 (No-Report-due-to-RO at RO tier), E4 (status/authoring right), `workflow_actions` (P01 reassignment).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/escalate` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/cycles/{cycleId}/sla-status` · `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/no-report-tier`

**UI Behavior Notes.** SLA dashboard with overdue heatmap and escalation actions. On escalation, the new author sees a banner: "Authoring right transferred to you due to RO non-response by DD-MMM-YYYY." No-Report-due-to-RO action with DSC.

**Edge Cases.** Transferee also overdue (cascade to next tier); apex officer with no higher authority (record No-Report / route to designated alternate per chain config, R12); officer acts just after escalation (escalation wins, prior task revoked); conflicted transferee (skip to next eligible).

### FR-PS08-20 — Digital Signature & Non-Repudiation (statutory `GAP`)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** RO, RvO, AA, Competent/Custodian authorities; eSign/DSC provider
- **User Story:** As a certifying officer, I want my statutory acts bound by a legally-recognised digital signature (DSC/eSign), distinct from session MFA, so the APAR record is non-repudiable.

**Description.** **`GAP (enterprise-specific)`** — the platform provides MFA/session auth (P02) but not a statutory DSC engine; PS08 authors a signing service that runs on the **X.3 integration framework** (eSign/DSC provider; credentials from **P04 `integration_credentials`**), producing `digital_signatures` (E23) over a canonical payload hash using DSC, Aadhaar-eSign, or HSM token. Artefacts are stored encrypted in **PS13**; signature events are captured by **P05**. Signatures are **required** on: tier certification (RO/RvO/AA), disclosure acknowledgement, calibration ratification, expunction, No-Report Certificate, sealed-cover release, disposal and confidentiality downgrade.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. A signing ceremony hashes the canonical payload (SHA-256), invokes the X.3 provider, and stores `signature_value`, `certificate_serial`, `signed_payload_hash`, method and `verification_status=VALID`.
2. The dependent act does not commit unless a VALID signature is attached. **(R10)**
3. **MFA step-up (P02)** authenticates the session; the **digital signature** binds the record — both required where specified (distinct controls).
4. Signatures are re-verifiable; a later REVOKED/EXPIRED/INVALID status is recorded without altering the original payload (append-only).
5. Signature artefacts stored encrypted in PS13 and referenced by entity.

**Business Rules.** BR1: A signature binds exactly one entity (`entity_type`,`entity_id`); reuse rejected. BR2: Signature payload hash must match the record state at signing; tampering invalidates verification. BR3: Provider outages queue the act as pending-signature (X.3 dead-letter), never auto-bypass.

**Data Model References.** E23 (create/verify), E8/E15/E18/E19/E21 (reference signature_id), `documents` (PS13), `integration_credentials` (P04).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/signatures` (sign ceremony, Idempotency-Key) · `GET /api/v1/ps08/signatures/{id}/verify` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/signatures`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Signing ceremony modal (select DSC token / Aadhaar-eSign), showing the canonical payload summary. Signature badges on certified records with a "Verify" action. Pending-signature state if the provider is down.

**Edge Cases.** Provider down (queue pending-signature); certificate expired at signing (block); revoked certificate discovered later (mark INVALID, alert, do not mutate record); payload changed after signing attempt (re-sign required).

**LLD.**
| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SignatureService`, `DSCProviderClient` (X.3), `PayloadCanonicaliser`, `VerificationService` |
| Backend Flow | Canonicalise → hash → X.3 provider sign → store E23 → attach to entity → commit act; verify recomputes/queries status |
| Data Operations | INSERT E23 (append-only); UPDATE referencing entity signature_id; PS13 store; P05 captures |
| Validation | One-entity binding, payload-hash match, certificate validity |
| Authorization | P02: signer = the acting authority; org/tier scoped |
| State Changes | signature created; dependent act commits only with VALID signature |
| Failure Handling | Provider down → pending (X.3 dead-letter); expired/revoked → block/mark INVALID; mismatch → re-sign |
| Dependencies | eSign/DSC provider (X.3), P04, PS13; consumed by FR-04/05/06/08/09/15/17/18 |
| Test Guidance | Unit: canonicalisation, one-entity binding, hash match. Integration: sign→commit, provider-down queue, later-revocation handling |

### FR-PS08-21 — Probation Confirmation Appraisal (statutory)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** Reporting Officer, Reviewing Officer, Accepting Authority, HR/APAR Cell
- **User Story:** As HR, I want the PROBATION cycle to drive a confirmation/extension/discharge recommendation fed to PS01 and PS12, distinct from the annual APAR, so probationers are confirmed lawfully and on time.

**Description.** Reuses **M09 probation confirmation + `JOB-M09-PROBATION`**. A `cycle_type=PROBATION` runs a lighter appraisal whose outcome is a **probation decision** — CONFIRMED, EXTENDED, or DISCHARGE_RECOMMENDED — rather than a numeric annual grade. The flow uses RO→RvO→AA (P01) and disclosure but concludes by writing `probation_outcome` and feeding PS01 (employment status / confirmation date) and PS12 (SR event). Extension respects `probation_extension_max_months`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. A PROBATION cycle materialises probation forms with the probation template; the outcome field is `probation_outcome`.
2. The AA certifies a probation outcome with DSC; CONFIRMED records a confirmation date (mirrors M09 `confirmation_date`).
3. EXTENDED creates a successor probation cycle window within `probation_extension_max_months`; repeated extension beyond the cap is blocked.
4. The outcome is disclosed (mandatory) and, on finalisation, fed to PS01 (status/confirmation) and PS12 (SR event).
5. DISCHARGE_RECOMMENDED routes to the competent authority and is referenced to PS09/PS01 per policy.

**Business Rules.** BR1: Probation outcome is not a numeric APAR grade; it does not feed the PS06 benchmark. BR2: Confirmation feeds PS01 employment status and PS12 as a statutory service event. BR3: Extension beyond the cap requires explicit higher authority and reason.

**Data Model References.** E1 (probation_period_months, extension cap), E4 (probation_outcome), `service_register_events` (PS12), `employees` (PS01 status/confirmation feed).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/forms/{formId}/probation/decide` · `POST .../probation/extend` · `GET /api/v1/ps08/cycles?type=PROBATION&limit=&cursor=`

**UI Behavior Notes.** Probation workbench showing supervision summary and a decision selector (Confirm / Extend / Recommend Discharge) with DSC. Confirmation date picker. Extension capped with a remaining-months indicator.

**Edge Cases.** Extension cap reached (block, escalate); discharge recommendation (route to competent authority + PS09/PS01); probationer transferred (multi-RO periods apply); confirmation overdue (SLA escalation FR-PS08-19).

### FR-PS08-22 — Cycle Errata / Controlled Correction (statutory)

- **Module:** PS08 · **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator, HR/APAR Cell, Accepting/Competent Authority
- **User Story:** As HR, when a configuration error (e.g., wrong adverse threshold or scale binding) is discovered mid-cycle, I want a controlled correction and re-derivation path so I don't have to force every affected case through representation.

**Description.** Provides a guarded **P01 maker-checker errata flow**: an authorised admin proposes a cycle/scale/threshold correction; the system computes the impact set (affected forms); the change is approved (dual-control); and affected derived values (`is_adverse`, `below_benchmark`, labels, eligibility) are **re-derived** in a transaction with full P05 audit and re-notification (X.2). Errata never silently edits certified grades without re-derivation provenance, and affected officers are re-notified.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
1. An errata proposal identifies the corrected parameter, the rationale, and the computed impact set (count + list).
2. Applying errata requires dual-control approval (P01 maker+checker) and, for certified forms, re-derivation provenance (old → new recorded).
3. Re-derivation recomputes flags and, where eligibility changes, emits corrective PS06/PS12 events (never silent overwrite).
4. Affected officers and authorities are re-notified; the cycle records an ERRATA status during application.
5. Errata is fully P05-audited and reversible only via a further errata (append-only provenance).

**Business Rules.** BR1: Errata cannot alter the substantive assessment (remarks/grades chosen by officers); it corrects configuration and re-derives system-computed flags. BR2: An errata that would worsen an officer's outcome (newly adverse) triggers a fresh disclosure + representation window for those cases. BR3: Errata on a posted form emits corrective SR/PS06 events, never destructive edits.

**Data Model References.** E1 (corrected parameters; ERRATA status), E3 (corrected thresholds, new version), E4 (re-derived flags), `service_register_events`/PS06 (corrective events).

**API References.** `POST /api/v1/ps08/cycles/{cycleId}/errata/propose` · `GET .../errata/{errataId}/impact` · `POST .../errata/{errataId}/approve` · `POST .../errata/{errataId}/apply` (Idempotency-Key)

**UI Behavior Notes.** Errata wizard: select parameter → preview impact set (counts, affected officers, before/after flags) → dual-control approval → apply with re-notification summary. Clear "this will re-open disclosure for N newly-adverse cases" warning.

**Edge Cases.** Errata makes a favourable case adverse (fresh disclosure/representation); errata on posted forms (corrective events); concurrent errata (serialize — `ERR-PS08-ERRATA`); zero-impact errata (no-op with audit).

**LLD.**
| Aspect | Detail |

### 7.2 Cross-cutting UI rules

- Mobile-first, responsive (breakpoints 375/768/1280 px, touch targets ≥ 44×44 px); collapsible sidebar with menu icons and hamburger toggle; **Workspace switcher** (Me / My Team / Admin) per Foundation Manager-review model.
- Every screen implements the canonical UI-state standard (empty, loading, error, success, no-permission, partial-data; offline where relevant) — no skeleton-only screens; real fields, data, API calls and states.
- WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, visible focus, AA contrast, ARIA labels; dark mode via design tokens.
- Confidential content uses **P02 field-mask-on-serialization** (hidden, not greyed) and watermarked PDFs (PS13).
- All lists **cursor-paginated** (limit default 25/max 100); destructive/guarded actions confirm with consequence summary; certification/ratification/disposal require MFA step-up **and** DSC; disposal/downgrade require a second approver (P01 dual-control).
- Dates display `DD-MMM-YYYY`; money INR; timestamps in user timezone; UTC storage.

### 7.3 Plain-language role context & "why hidden" (R17 — leak-prevention control)

- Every assessment/disclosure screen shows a **plain-language tier banner** stating who the user is on this APAR and what they may do.
- Where a field is **absent** due to the P02 mask, a **reason banner** explains why ("hidden until disclosure", "not visible to your tier", "sealed cover"), treated as a confidentiality leak-prevention control, not cosmetic.
- Multi-role users see the lowest-privilege mask (P02 intersection) with a note explaining which role is active.

---

## Section 8 — API & Integration

### 8.1 Conventions (platform-adopted)

- Base path **`/api/v1/ps08`**; JSON; Bearer JWT carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; endpoints call **`Authorization.check`** (P02) — never re-implement permission logic.
- **Cursor pagination only** (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100 + `cursor=` → `next_cursor`); `?sort=field:asc|desc`; field filters per endpoint. **No offset paging.**
- **`Idempotency-Key`** on all unsafe POSTs that start a transaction (24h replay) — required for workflow-initiating, certify, ratify, seal, post-to-sr, sign actions.
- **`X-Correlation-Id`** carried/assigned per request, echoed in the response header and written to every P05 audit/log line.
- Effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` (staged, `VAL-EFFECTIVE`).
- Statutory acts (certify, acknowledge, ratify, expunge, No-Report, seal-release, dispose, downgrade) require an attached VALID `signature_id` (FR-PS08-20).

### 8.2 Canonical error envelope (platform)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Performance weightage must total 100% (DEVELOPMENT goals excluded)",
    "field": "goals.weightage",
    "details": { "delta": 5.0 }
  }
}
```

The correlation id is carried in the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header**, not a body `requestId`. 2xx returns the resource payload.

### 8.3 Standard error-code table + module errors

**Platform 8-code standard table (Foundation §1):**

| Code | HTTP | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | **422** | input failed a `VAL-*` rule |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | no/invalid session or step-up needed |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | authenticated but not permitted (never leaks out-of-scope existence) |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | resource absent or out of scope |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | idempotency replay, duplicate workflow start, state conflict |
| `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | 412 | a required precondition not met (incl. missing DSC, unconfigured chain) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | rate limit exceeded |
| `INTERNAL` | 500 | unexpected server error (upstream failures mapped here via X.3 + `ERR-LOADFAIL`) |

> The v2 invented codes are overridden: `VALIDATION_ERROR(400)`→`VALIDATION_FAILED(422)`; `AUTH_REQUIRED(401)`→`UNAUTHENTICATED(401)`; `INTERNAL_ERROR(500)`→`INTERNAL(500)`; `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE(503)` dropped (handled via X.3 mapping + `INTERNAL`/`ERR-LOADFAIL`). No `503` in the standard table.

**Module-unique `ERR-PS08-*` (registered in the Foundation §5 index), each mapped to a standard code:**

| `ERR-PS08-*` id | Standard code/HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR-PS08-WEIGHTAGE` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` 422 | Performance goal weightages ≠ 100% at lock (`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM`) |

| `ERR-PS08-STATE` | `CONFLICT` 409 | Action not allowed in current form status |
| `ERR-PS08-GRADERANGE` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` 422 | Grade outside scale bounds |
| `ERR-PS08-ADVEVID` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` 422 | Adverse remark lacks disclosable evidence (`VAL-PS08-ADVEVID`, R5) |
| `ERR-PS08-REPWINDOW` | `CONFLICT` 409 | Representation window elapsed (condonation required) |
| `ERR-PS08-DISCLOSE` | `CONFLICT` 409 | Action blocked until APAR disclosed |
| `ERR-PS08-RATIFY` | `CONFLICT` 409 | Calibration not ratified by competent authority (R1) |
| `ERR-PS08-FORCEDDIST` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` 422 | Forced distribution removed; method unavailable (R2) |
| `ERR-PS08-SEALED` | `CONFLICT` 409 | Finalise/post/feed blocked while sealed (R3) |
| `ERR-PS08-CHAIN` | `PRECONDITION_FAILED` 412 | Apex chain cannot satisfy "all distinct"; needs config (`VAL-PS08-CHAIN`, R12) |
| `ERR-PS08-SIGN` | `PRECONDITION_FAILED` 412 | Statutory act needs a valid DSC/eSign (R10) |
| `ERR-PS08-SIGNINVALID` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` 422 | Signature verification failed/revoked/expired |
| `ERR-PS08-DUALCTRL` | `FORBIDDEN` 403 | Second-person approval needed for disposal/downgrade (R23) |
| `ERR-PS08-TAMPER` | `CONFLICT` 409 | OPEN-PLAT-03 chain verification failed (R11) |
| `ERR-PS08-ERRATA` | `CONFLICT` 409 | Concurrent cycle errata; serialize (R18) |
| `ERR-PS08-ALREADYPOSTED` | `CONFLICT` 409 | SR posting is an idempotent no-op |

## Section 12 — Reporting & Analytics

| Report | Audience | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Cycle completion funnel | HR, leadership | Counts per form status (incl. SEALED_COVER, ESCALATED), overdue, by org/cadre |
| Rating distribution (pre/post calibration) | HR, AA | Histogram vs target (diagnostic, `VAL-DISTRIB`); skew per RO/unit |
| Grading-skew / bias flags | HR | ROs/units beyond deviation threshold |

## Section 13 — Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data migration (on P06 ETL+V)

| Source | Target | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy APAR records (paper/scanned) | E4 + `documents` (PS13) | Digitise; capture final grade, label, adverse flag, cycle; link scanned PDF; `gov_source_id` traceability |
| Historical grades | `service_register_events` (PS12) | Back-post as historical events (flagged), preserving original dates |
| Multi-RO history | E19 report periods | Reconstruct part-periods where supervision history exists; else single-period |
| Competency framework | PS07 read | Map legacy competencies to PS07 catalog |
| Reporting chains | PS01/M01 | Reconcile RO/RvO/AA history per cycle |
| M09 in-flight goal plans/reviews | M09 entities | Reuse existing PrimeSoft M09 rows; PS08 attaches statutory APAR wrappers |

### 13.2 Migration rules
- Run on **P06** — three mandatory staging dry runs gate cutover; waves; failed records logged with source row + violated rule in `migration_runs`.
- Historical records imported in `ARCHIVED` status; no re-adjudication; final grades validated against the historical scale (snapshot).
- All migrated APARs default to CONFIDENTIAL (P02); access logged from import onward (P05).
- Reconciliation report lists unmapped chains/competencies/periods for manual resolution (no silent drops).
- Migrated records without a digital signature are flagged `legacy-unsigned`; new acts require DSC.

### 13.3 Launch plan (phased — R16)
1. **Phase-1 GA (statutory core, no flags):** Pilot one entity for one cycle exercising the legally-required path: configure cycle → goals (M09, snapshot) → self → multi-RO RO/RvO/AA (DSC, P01) → mandatory disclosure → representation (+escalation) → post to PS12, with sealed-cover, auto-escalation (`JOB-M09-SLA`), P05/OPEN-PLAT-03 custody and P01 dual-control disposal live.
2. **GA gates:** lock the **grade-derivation contract** and the **P02 field-mask contract** as standalone libraries with their own test suites; the **field-mask 200k load-test (p95 < 500 ms)** is a hard GA gate (R14).
3. **Phase-2 (flagged differentiators):** enable `ps08.calibration` (ratified recommendation), `ps08.continuous-feedback`, `ps08.msf-360` after the statutory core is proven (capability flags registered in RBAC §4.3).
4. Verify PS12/PS06/PS07/PS09/eSign integration end-to-end (X.3 outbox retry, sealed-cover suppression, signature-provider outage).
5. Train ROs/RvOs/AAs and custodians; publish confidentiality + sealed-cover + signing SOPs; phased rollout by cadre; monitor SLA/escalation dashboards; cutover legacy capture.

### 13.4 Rollback / contingency
- X.3 outbox enables safe replay if downstream modules lag; pending-signature state holds acts during eSign outage.
- Capability flags per differentiator (calibration, continuous, MSF, bell-curve) for staged enablement; Phase-1 runs with all off.
- Statutory records are append-only with P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03 tamper-evidence; corrections via corrective events / controlled errata, never destructive edits.

### 14.3 Parallel-agent build plan (phased — R16)

| Wave | FRs (parallelisable) | Phase | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 (hard libraries — gate) | FR-07 (grade engine), FR-20 (DSC/X.3), FR-15 (P02 field-mask) | P1 | Built first as standalone tested libraries; field-mask 200k load-test is a GA gate |
| W1 (foundation) | FR-01, FR-18 (report periods) | P1 | Cycle/forms (on M09) + multi-RO scaffolding |
| W2 | FR-02 (+snapshot), FR-17 (sealed cover) | P1 | Goals (M09) decoupled+snapshot; sealing scaffolding |
| W3 | FR-03, FR-12, FR-19 (escalation) | P1 | Self-appraisal, competency, SLA escalation |
| W4 | FR-04, FR-05, FR-06 | P1 | Tier assessments on P01 — consume DSC + periods + sealed guard |
| W5 | FR-08 (disclosure/representation), FR-13 (PIP), FR-21 (probation) | P1 | Mandatory disclosure + appeal ladder; PIP; probation |
| W6 | FR-14 (posting to PS12/PS06), FR-22 (errata) | P1 | Posting (sealed-aware) + errata correction |
| W7 (flagged differentiators) | FR-09 (calibration), FR-10, FR-11 | P2 | Behind capability flags after statutory core proven |
| W8 | FR-16 (analytics incl. bias-disparity) | P1/P2 | Reads all; feeds PS14; last |

Shared contracts (platform error table, P01 state machines, grade engine, P02 field-mask, DSC, OPEN-PLAT-03 verify) are built first as libraries to avoid drift across parallel agents.

## Section 16 — Appendices

### Appendix A — Sample 10-point APAR scale bands
| Band | Range | Descriptor |
|---|---|---|
| Outstanding | 9.00–10.00 | Exceptional, role-model performance |
| Very Good | 7.00–8.99 | Consistently exceeds expectations |
| Good | 6.00–6.99 | Meets expectations (benchmark) |
| Average | 4.00–5.99 | Partially meets expectations |
| Below Average | 1.00–3.99 | Adverse — improvement required |

### Appendix B — Tier-aware field visibility (illustrative; via P02 field-mask; absent fields carry a reason banner, R17)
| Field | Appraisee (pre-disclosure) | RO | RvO | AA | Auditor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Goals / self-appraisal | full | full | full | full | full |
| RO remarks/grade (per period) | masked | full (own period) | full | full | full |
| RvO remarks/grade | masked | masked | full | full | full |
| AA final grade | after disclosure | read | read | full | full |
| Integrity remark | after disclosure | author | read | read | full |
| Sealed-cover status | reason-banner only | masked | masked | full | full |

### Appendix C — Statutory calendar (illustrative APAR year)
| Milestone | Indicative window | Job |
|---|---|---|
| Goal setting (M09 plan) | Apr–May | `JOB-M09-PLAN-OPEN` |
| Self-appraisal | Apr (period end +) | `JOB-M09-REVIEW-OPEN` |
| RO assessment (per period) | within 30 days of self | `JOB-M09-SLA` |
| RvO review | within 15 days of RO | `JOB-M09-SLA` |
| AA acceptance (DSC) | within 15 days of RvO | `JOB-M09-SLA` |
| Calibration (Phase-2, if enabled) | pre-cert or post-cert ratification | `JOB-M09-CALIB` |
| Disclosure (mandatory, full) | within 15 days of acceptance | `JOB-M09-NOTIFY` |
| Representation window | within statutory days of dispatch/ack | `JOB-M09-AUTOACK`, `JOB-PS08-REP-SLA` |
| Posting to SR (PS12) | after representation resolution and not sealed | `JOB-PS08-SR-POST` |

### Appendix D — Assumptions & open items
- Exact statutory representation window, disposal deadline and condonation authority are configuration, set per jurisdiction at deployment (config cascade `platform → tenant → entity`).
- `representation_clock_start` (dispatch vs acknowledgement) is a per-jurisdiction config choice (R8); deemed-disclosure (`JOB-M09-AUTOACK`) still opens the window.
- Competency catalog and role-required levels are owned by PS07; PS08 consumes snapshots.
- Adjudicating-authority seniority and apex chain-truncation rules are configurable to the deploying enterprise's service rules (R12).
- Minimum supervision threshold defaults to 3 months and is configurable (R4, `VAL-PS08-SUPV`).
- The eSign/DSC provider (X.3) and OPEN-PLAT-03 anchoring schedule are environment-specific — **confirm OPEN-PLAT-03 status before build** (Platform §P05/§Z).

### Appendix E — Reuse confirmation
This BRD reuses, without redefining: the **PrimeSoft M09 Performance** model (goal plans, goals, review cycles, review templates, calibration sessions, PIP, MSF, continuous feedback, probation confirmation, contribution levels) and its `VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM/DISTRIB/ACHV/GOALNAME` validators, `JOB-M09-*` jobs and `MSG-M09-*` templates; the platform engines **P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3**; the platform entities `employees`/`org_units`/`designations`/`cadres`/`roles`/`contribution_levels`, `documents`, `notifications`, `consent_records`, `integration_credentials`, `workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`, `audit_log`/`security_audit_log`, `migration_runs`, and the **PS12 `service_register_events`** ledger; the RBAC v1.7 model; and the platform API conventions, error table and NFR baseline. Module-owned entities E1–E23 extend, and do not fork, the M09 model.

| Risk | Adopted improvement | Primary FR/Entity |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Calibration as ratified recommendation | FR-09, E21, E15 |
| R2 | Remove forced distribution; bell-curve off | FR-09, E14 |

## Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform

This section maps every PS08 FR to the platform service(s) it runs on (P01/P02/P05/P06/X/W and the M09 base), and names any `GAP (enterprise-specific)` engine authored. PS08 is an **EXTEND of PrimeSoft M09 Performance**; it authors only the statutory APAR layer and runs everything else on the platform.

| FR | Runs on (platform / M09) | `GAP (enterprise-specific)` authored | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-PS08-01 Cycle/template config | **M09** appraisal period/review cycle; **W.2** form; **P01** chain resolution; `JOB-M09-PLAN-OPEN/REVIEW-OPEN` | APAR statutory calendar/clock/chain config | Cycle binds the M09 review cycle and goal-plan window |
| FR-PS08-02 Goal setting | **M09** `goals`/`goal_plans`; **`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM/GOALNAME`** | snapshot-on-lock (E20) | Reuses the M09 OKR plan; adds immutable statutory snapshot |
| FR-PS08-03 Self-appraisal | **M09** self review | — | — |
| FR-PS08-04 RO assessment | **P01** (`SEQUENTIAL`/`DYNAMIC_APPROVER`); **X.3** DSC; **P05** | multi-tier APAR + adverse-evidence guard | Tier-1 of the statutory chain |
| FR-PS08-05 RvO review | **P01**; **P02** COI; **X.3** DSC | multi-tier APAR | Tier-2 |
| FR-PS08-06 AA acceptance | **P01**; **P02** MFA step-up; **X.3** DSC | certification + ratification | Tier-3; maps grade to M09 contribution level |
| FR-PS08-07 Scales & grade roll-up | **`VAL-WEIGHTAGE/WSUM/SUBWSUM`**; M09 rating | explicit weightage-policy + deterministic roll-up | Single roll-up library |
| FR-PS08-08 Disclosure & representation | **P01**; **X.2**; **P05**; `JOB-M09-AUTOACK`, `JOB-PS08-REP-SLA` | mandatory disclosure + appeal ladder + CAT handoff | Statutory |
| FR-PS08-09 Calibration | **M09 `calibration_sessions`**; **`VAL-DISTRIB`** (diagnostic) | ratified-recommendation control (E21/E15) | Extends M09 calibration |
| FR-PS08-10 Continuous feedback | **M09** continuous feedback + two-way thread | disclosability tagging | Phase-2 flag |
| FR-PS08-11 MSF / 360 | **M09 MSF** | adverse-sole-basis guard | Phase-2 flag |
| FR-PS08-12 Competency & gap | M09 competency; **PS07** (X.3) | — | Writes PS07 nomination |
| FR-PS08-13 PIP | **M09 PIP**; **P01** concurrence | — | — |
| FR-PS08-14 SR posting & PS06 feed | **PS12** ledger (on **P05**); **X.3** outbox; `JOB-PS08-SR-POST` | SR event contract + PS06 reference feed | PS12 owns the ledger; PS08 appends |
| FR-PS08-15 Custody & confidentiality | **P02** field-mask; **P05** + **OPEN-PLAT-03**; **P01** dual-control; **PS13** | disclosure/custody domain ledger + heir access | Replaces invented hash-chain |
| FR-PS08-16 Analytics | **P02** scope; feeds **PS14** | bias-disparity + rater-leniency model | Min-N suppression |
| FR-PS08-17 Sealed Cover | **PS09** subscribe; **P01**; `JOB-PS08-SEAL-MONITOR` | Sealed Cover Procedure | Statutory |
| FR-PS08-18 Multi-RO part-period | **`VAL-PS08-SUPV/PERIODTILE`**; **X.3** DSC | part-period reports + No-Report Certificate | Statutory |
| FR-PS08-19 SLA auto-escalation | **P01 SLA runtime** + **`JOB-M09-SLA`** | authoring-right transfer rules | Reuses M09 SLA job |
| FR-PS08-20 Digital signature | **X.3** eSign provider; **P04** creds; **P05**; **PS13** | **`GAP`**: statutory DSC/eSign engine (E23) | Platform has MFA, not statutory DSC |
| FR-PS08-21 Probation | **M09 probation** + **`JOB-M09-PROBATION`**; **PS01**; **PS12** | probation→SR/employment feed | Reuses M09 probation |
| FR-PS08-22 Cycle errata | **P01** maker-checker; **P05**; **X.2** | controlled re-derivation | Statutory |

**Net-new (`GAP`) engines PS08 authors (each still runs on platform plumbing):** the multi-tier APAR adjudication wrapper (E4/E8), representation/appeal (E13), Sealed Cover (E4 fields/E18), multi-RO part-period + No-Report (E19), snapshot-on-lock bridge (E20), ratified-calibration control (E21/E15), digital-signature/non-repudiation (E23 — on X.3+P05+PS13), and the disclosure/custody domain ledger (E18 — on P05+OPEN-PLAT-03). Everything authored here consumes **P01 (workflow), P02 (authz/PII ceiling), P05 (audit), X.1–X.3 (jobs/notify/integration), W.1–W.3 (flows/forms/notify-config), P06 (migration)** and the **M09 Performance** business model — it never re-implements them.

## Amendments (v3 → v3.1: cross-module remediation)

Surgical alignment to the frozen PS12 SR ingestion contract (REMEDIATION D1; R1 findings F-01/F-03/F-08/F-10/F-11). No new PS08 capability; the appraisal-outcome write path is restated to consume the canonical contract.

| # | v3 (as written) | v3.1 (remediated) | Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `…/post-to-sr` named the SR write but left the actual PS12 endpoint implicit; LLD said "INSERT `service_register_events`" | `…/post-to-sr` documented as an **internal façade that relays to the canonical write-port `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`**; PS08 no longer implies a direct ledger INSERT or a `/api/v1/sr/events` URL (PS12 owns the row on P05) | F-01; D1 write-port |
| 2 | SR dedup was "one event per `(form_id)`" | Populates the **PS12 canonical tuple `(source_module, source_reference_id, source_event_version)`** with `source_module="PS08"`, `source_reference_id=form_id`; `Idempotency-Key` header may be a writer-local hash but the persisted tuple is the contract | F-03; D1 dedup tuple |
| 3 | Event payload `{type:"APAR_FINAL_GRADE", …}` with no category | Cites the exact PS12-published code **`APAR_FINAL_GRADE`** verbatim with **`event_category=APPRAISAL`** (the category PS12 added for PS08) | F-08; D1 taxonomy |
| 4 | No `source_module` field on the SR payload (relied on auth context) | Explicit **`source_module="PS08"`** stamped on the ingest payload (value in `PS01..PS14`), so PS12's `allowed_source_modules` check is deterministic | F-10; D1 provenance |
| 5 | `tenant_id`/`entity_id` carried on PS08 tables but omitted from the SR payload | Explicit **`tenant_id`+`entity_id`** required on the ingest payload (PS12 hashes `tenant_id`+`employee_id` into `entry_hash`) | F-11; D1 scoping |
| 6 | `fact_key` ambiguous for appraisal | **No `fact_key`** sent — `APPRAISAL` final grade is not qualifying-service-bearing, so PS12 FR-01's `fact_correlation_rule` does not apply (fact_key mandatory only for PS04/PS05/PS06/PS10/PS11) | D1 fact_key rule |
| 7 | PS06 eligibility feed | Unchanged — confirmed: PS08 feeds **PS06 promotion eligibility by reference** (`final_grade`/`below_benchmark`/`cycle_id`, sealed-suppressed); promotion decisioning stays in PS06 (no PS06 logic duplicated here) | D2; FR-PS08-14 BR3 |
