# Document Management and Secure Storage — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS13, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Programme:** PrimeSoft HRMS — public-sector configuration & extension of the **PrimeSoft HRMS** platform
**Module:** PS13 — Document Management and Secure Storage (PS13-DMS) — `PS-M13`, ex `M13-DMS`
**Relationship:** **EXTEND / REUSE** of PrimeSoft **M11 Document Management** (Reconciliation §A row PS13; §B code map; §C overrides; §D net-new)
**Owner of the enterprise document surface:** This module — but it does **not** fork a parallel store; it **re-anchors onto the existing PrimeSoft M11 vault** (`letter_templates`, document vault, `signoff_transactions`, retention classes) and adds only the enterprise-statutory extensions (WORM, legal-hold, security-clearance, certified-true-copy, anchored access audit).
**Status:** v3.2 (field-reconciled — v3.0 platform re-grounding + v3.1 error-code hygiene + v3.2 CSV/prototype field reconciliation; supersedes v2.0 for the enterprise build; preserves all v2 content and rigor)
**Reads with:** `docs/brd/PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`, `docs/brd/MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md`, Platform Spec v1.6 (P01–P06, X.1–X.3, W.1–W.3), Foundation FS v1.6 (VAL-*/JOB-*/MSG-*/ERR-* catalogues), RBAC Design v1.7.
**Revision basis:** v2.0 BRD (all 21 Adopted Council Improvements + risks R1–R22) **re-grounded** onto PrimeSoft so the module consumes platform engines by id and never re-authors workflow, RBAC, audit, notification, job, or migration plumbing.

> **Re-grounding rule (Foundation §1.1).** Where v2 invented a convention, contract, or shared entity that the
> real platform already owns, v3 **defers to the platform artefact** and records the override (see
> `## Amendments (v2 → v3)`). PrimeSoft **M11** already ships a versioned, access-controlled, encrypted document
> vault with letter templates/merge fields (`VAL-M11-MERGE`), retention classes (`VAL-M11-RETENTION`), signer
> sign-off (`VAL-M11-SIGNER`), the `DocumentGen.generate / sign-off` service (Platform §Y), `JOB-M11-BULKLTR/
> RETENTION/DISPOSAL/SIGNOFF-REMIND` (Foundation §4), `MSG-M11-*` (Foundation §5), and the **Document Admin**
> role + **Letter Admin** capability flag (RBAC §2.2/§4.3). PS13 **aligns to that model** and adds only the
> **enterprise-specific** statutory controls as **EXTENSIONS**: WORM immutability, legal-hold with SoD, principal
> **security-clearance**, certified-true-copy, DPDPA erasure precedence lattice, and cryptographically anchored
> access audit. The enterprise scope (Reconciliation §A) classes PS13 as **REUSE-AS-IS / EXTEND**.

> **Attach/fetch contract (the platform document service).** PS13 is the **single attach/fetch contract** every
> other enterprise module **PS01–PS12** consumes. Modules do **not** store binaries; they attach documents through
> PS13's frozen `:attach` / `:fetch?intent=` API and store only a `document_id` reference. PS13 expresses this as a
> **platform-consistent document service** layered on PrimeSoft object storage + KMS envelope encryption,
> running document generation/sign-off on **P01 + W.1** via `DocumentGen.generate`, enforcing access via **P02**,
> and auditing every view/download via **P05**.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

This BRD specifies the **Enterprise Document Management and Secure Storage** service (PS13) as a **public-sector
extension of PrimeSoft M11**. It provides a single, governed, encrypted, access-controlled store for every file
produced or consumed across the PrimeSoft HRMS suite: identity proofs for personal-detail changes (PS02), leave
sanction scans and medical certificates (PS03/PS04), relieving/joining orders (PS05), promotion/posting/seniority
orders (PS06), training certificates (PS07), APAR PDFs (PS08), charge-sheets and inquiry exhibits (PS09), payslips
and Form-16 (PS10), Pension Payment Orders / PPOs and terminal-benefit dossiers (PS11), and the statutory Service
Register page-images and certified copies (PS12). Documents are stored once (within a single security domain),
versioned, classified, retained per statutory schedule, and made discoverable through permission-aware search —
while every view, download and print is audited via the **P05** dual-log substrate and every binary is encrypted
at rest (KMS envelope) and in transit (TLS 1.2+). The document-generation and sign-off flows run on the existing
**`DocumentGen.generate / sign-off`** service over **P01 WorkflowEngine + W.1**.

### 1.2 Business context

Public-sector HR is **document-centric and statutory**. Service registers, charge memos, pension orders and
seniority records have legal weight; they must be tamper-evident, retained for decades (some permanently),
disposed of only under an approved disposition schedule, and frozen on legal hold during litigation. PrimeSoft
M11 already governs ordinary HR documents (letters, policy library, vault, retention, sign-off, disposal). The
**enterprise delta** is statutory custody: **WORM** immutability, **legal hold** with segregation of duties,
principal **security clearance**, **certified true copies**, an **erasure precedence lattice** reconciled with
the DPDPA right-to-erasure, and **cryptographically anchored** access audit. v3 delivers these as extensions
that run on the platform engines — DPDPA erasure-redaction follows the **P05 redaction-marker path + JOB-M11-
DISPOSAL**, tamper-evidence tracks the platform **OPEN-PLAT-03** hash-chain proposal rather than inventing a
parallel mechanism — aligned to OWASP ASVS, the India DPDP Act 2023, and the IT Act 2000 §3A (electronic
signatures).

### 1.3 Module objectives

1. **Re-anchor** the enterprise document surface onto the **PrimeSoft M11 vault** (no fork): reuse the vault,
   `letter_templates`/merge-fields, `signoff_transactions`, retention classes, and `DocumentGen.generate`.
2. Provide the **single canonical document service** (`documents` + frozen `:attach`/`:fetch` API) that
   **PS01–PS12** consume, layered on PrimeSoft object storage + KMS envelope encryption.
3. Enforce **encryption at rest** (envelope encryption via KMS, with a defined key-DR/escrow policy) and **in
   transit** (TLS 1.2+).
4. Provide **versioning** with optional (per-type) check-in/check-out, supersede, and immutable version history.
5. Enforce access via **P02** — RBAC v1.7 + org/relationship scope + **enterprise security-clearance** + classification
   PII-tier field masking + need-to-know, deny-by-default, mask-on-serialization.
6. Scan every upload for **malware**, validate file-type/size (`VAL-FILE`), and verify **integrity** by checksum.
7. Provide **OCR + permission-aware search**, sandboxed previews, and **domain-scoped deduplication** with no
   existence oracle.
8. Govern content lifecycle: **retention classes (reuse M11), legal hold (enterprise extension, SoD), approved
   disposition (`JOB-M11-RETENTION/DISPOSAL`)**, with **WORM** immutability for statutory documents and an
   explicit retention/hold/WORM/DPDP-erasure **precedence lattice**.
9. Provide **decade-durable e-signatures** (RFC-3161 + PAdES-LTV) via `DocumentGen` sign-off, watermarking,
   certified copies (v1), redaction (Phase 2), and DLP.
10. **Audit every access** (view/download/print/share) on the **P05** substrate, with enterprise-statutory hash-chain +
    external anchoring tracking **OPEN-PLAT-03**.

### 1.4 Scope summary

In scope: upload/ingestion; document types & metadata taxonomy (extending `letter_templates`/merge-field model);
classification/tagging; folders/cabinets; versioning; encryption/KMS (+ key-DR); access control via P02 (incl.
enterprise clearance); malware scanning; validation (`VAL-FILE`); sandboxed OCR/search; retention (reuse M11 retention
classes)/legal-hold (enterprise)/disposition (`JOB-M11-RETENTION/DISPOSAL`); e-signature (`DocumentGen` sign-off,
LTV-durable); watermarking/certified copies; access audit (P05 + anchoring); secure sharing/expiring links;
WORM; domain-scoped deduplication/integrity; previews; DLP; content lifecycle; orphan reaping; DPDPA
data-subject requests (P05 redaction path); and the provider-abstracted storage/AV/OCR/DLP/PKI layer.
**Phase 2 (fast-follow):** interactive redaction studio. **Out of scope:** business workflows that *use*
documents (those live in PS01–PS12), payroll/pension calculation, and end-user identity management (platform
`users`, P02/P04).

### 1.5 Key outcomes

- One governed source of truth for all enterprise HRMS content, **built on the existing M11 vault**, not a parallel store.
- Tamper-evident (P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03 anchored), encrypted, audited custody for statutory records.
- Faster retrieval (permission-aware search + previews) and lower storage cost (domain-scoped dedup).
- Defensible compliance posture: retention enforced, holds honoured (incl. future matches), erasure reconciled
  with statutory duty via the DPDPA redaction path, disposition certified, signatures verifiable for decades.

### 1.6 Plain-language narrative — "what happens when I drag a PDF in"

> *For non-engineers (records officers, clerks, approvers):*
>
> 1. **You drop a file** (or scan/photograph it). You pick the **document type** (e.g., "Charge Sheet") and fill
>    the short form it asks for (a **W.2 form** with `VAL-*` validation).
> 2. The system **checks it for viruses** and confirms the file is what it claims to be. If it is infected, it
>    is locked away and Security is told; you see only "blocked by security scan."
> 3. The clean file is **encrypted and stored once** in the M11 vault. If an identical file already exists *in
>    the same sensitivity level*, the system quietly reuses storage — you are never told whether a copy already
>    existed (so no one can probe for secret documents).
> 4. The system **reads the text** inside (OCR) so you can find it later — but you only ever see documents you
>    are cleared and permitted to see (enforced by **P02**, masked on serialization).
> 5. The document gets a **retention clock** (an M11 retention class) and, for statutory records, a **WORM lock**
>    (cannot be changed or deleted until its lawful time).
> 6. From then on, **every view, download or print is recorded** on the platform audit log (**P05**, DB-trigger).
>    Sharing, signing (via `DocumentGen` sign-off), certifying a true copy, placing a legal hold, and final
>    disposal all follow **P01** approval steps with a second person signing off where the law requires it
>    (segregation of duties enforced by P01/P02, not re-coded here).

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from the platform, not re-authored)

- **`tenant_id` (non-null) and `entity_id` (where entity-scoped) on every PS13 table**; scoping enforced at the
  **data/persistence layer** (Platform §0.1) — an unscoped query is rejected, never defaulted to "all".
- UUIDv4 PKs; separate human-readable business keys (`doc_no`).
- **Audit is the platform P05 dual log** (`audit_log` + `security_audit_log`), captured by **DB-trigger** on
  every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE — PS13 does **not** define its own mutation `audit_log`. Enterprise-statutory access
  audit (view/download/print) and tamper-evidence are the enterprise extension (FR-PS13-012/020), tracking OPEN-PLAT-03.
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE enums (§5.5); UTC storage; `DD-MMM-YYYY` display; user-locale rendering.
- **Cursor pagination only** (`?limit=` default 25, max 100, `cursor=`, response `next_cursor`); offset paging
  not used (Foundation §1).
- **Maker-checker is a configured P01 flow (W.1)** with SoD enforced by P01/P02 — not re-coded per action —
  for disposition, **legal-hold placement and release**, classification downgrade, clearance grant, DSR decision.
- **Canonical error envelope** `{ error: { code, message, field, details } }` + **`X-Correlation-Id` header**
  (Foundation §1; not a body `requestId`).
- All content-processing engines (AV, OCR, DLP, PKI/eSign) and storage sit behind **provider interfaces**.

### 2.3 Boundaries & integration points

- **PS01 Employee Profile (PrimeSoft M01 master)** — documents linked to `employee_id` context; photo/ID proofs;
  emits `EMPLOYEE_RETIRE`/`EMPLOYEE_MERGE` lifecycle events (anchor recompute) via the platform outbox.
- **PS02 Personal Details** — proof documents for change requests; the `E·AR` "Request change → approval" flow
  (P01, RBAC §7) routes the sensitive-change; PS13 stores the proof.
- **PS03/PS04 Leave/SR** — medical certificates, sanction orders posted to the **PS12 SR ledger**.
- **PS05/PS06 Transfer/Promotion** — relieving/joining/promotion/seniority order PDFs (often `DocumentGen`-generated).
- **PS07 Training** — certificates, course material.
- **PS08 Appraisal (PrimeSoft M09)** — APAR/PDF, calibration evidence.
- **PS09 Disciplinary** — charge-sheets, inquiry exhibits, sealed PI reports (confidential vault); emits
  `CASE_CLOSE` lifecycle events.
- **PS10/PS11 Payroll/Pension** — payslips, Form-16, PPO, terminal-benefit dossiers (long retention); PS11 emits
  `EMPLOYEE_RETIRE` confirmation.
- **PS12 Digital SR** — page-images, certified true copies, WORM statutory records (PS12 ledger runs on P05).
- **PS14 Dashboard (PrimeSoft M16 Analytics)** — reads document compliance metrics (read-only, `analytics.*`).
- **Platform** — P01 WorkflowEngine, P02 Authorization.check, P04 integration credentials, **P05 dual audit**,
  P06 migration, X.1 jobs, X.2 notifications, X.3 integration; **`DocumentGen.generate / sign-off`** (Platform
  §Y); `users`, `roles`, `org_units`, `consent_records`, `notifications`; KMS (+ key-DR), object storage,
  antivirus, OCR, signing/PKI, RFC-3161 TSA.

### 2.4 Explicit non-goals

- PS13 does not implement module-specific business workflows (e.g., disciplinary due-process) — it stores their
  documents and runs only the **document** workflows (generation, sign-off, lifecycle) on P01.
- PS13 does not author content (no word processor); it ingests and renders. (Check-out/check-in is **optional per
  type** — FR-PS13-004.) Letter authoring uses the existing M11 `letter_templates` model.
- PS13 does not own user identity/authentication (platform `users`, P02/P04) — but it **does** own the
  enterprise **security-clearance** attribute attached to a principal (FR-PS13-017), which P02 reads.
- PS13 does not compute payroll/pension; it stores their outputs.
- PS13 does not re-author workflow, RBAC, audit, notification, job-runner, or migration engines — it **consumes**
  P01, P02, P05, P06, X.1–X.3 by id.

## 3. Roles & Permissions

### 3.1 Role mapping to RBAC v1.7 (additions, not a parallel scheme)

Enterprise statutory actors are expressed as **RBAC v1.7 roles + capability flags ADDED to the taxonomy**
(`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6; Reconciliation §C), registered in RBAC §2.2/§4.3 with grant authority + audit.
**SoD (maker ≠ checker, no self-approval) is enforced by P01/P02**, not re-implemented here. The existing
PrimeSoft **Document Admin** role and **Letter Admin** capability flag are the baseline; PS13 adds records/
clearance/legal-hold/DPO roles for statutory custody.

| PS13 actor | Express as (RBAC v1.7) | Why distinct (SoD) |
|------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Employee (Self-Service)** | existing **Employee** role (`document.*` own-scope, RBAC §2.4) | End-user persona; views/downloads own permitted docs; e-signs assigned docs. Cannot manage taxonomy/retention. |
| **Document Owner** | **Employee** + optional "manages a shared cabinet" entitlement | Record-scoped management of own non-statutory docs; same human as Employee, different scope (consolidation note below). |
| **Uploader (Module Service)** | platform **service principal** (machine), per-module token | Machine principal attaching on behalf of a PS01–PS12 workflow; no human read rights. |
| **DMS Librarian** | existing **Document Admin** role (RBAC §2.2) | The **maker** for taxonomy + lifecycle; manages types, folders, classification *upgrades*, retention *assignment*; **proposes** disposition. Cannot approve own proposals. |
| **Records Manager (Custodian)** | **new entity-scoped role** `records_manager` (added, RBAC §2.2) + **Letter Admin** flag where it certifies generated copies | The **checker** for lifecycle; approves disposition, manages WORM, certifies true copies. maker ≠ checker enforced by P01. |
| **Legal Hold Administrator** | **new role** `legal_hold_admin` (added) | **Places** holds; manages e-discovery exports. Separated from the custodian who can destroy. |
| **Legal Hold Approver** | **new role** `legal_hold_approver` (added) | **Approves** high-value placement and **all** releases (dual control). Release re-enables destruction → second authority. |
| **Security / DLP Officer** | **new role** `security_dlp_officer` (added) + capability flags | Classification *downgrade* approval, DLP rules, quarantine release, key policy, **clearance grants**, anti-brute-force unlocks. Holds the "lower the guard" powers. |
| **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** | map to platform **DPO / Org-Admin audit access** (RBAC §6.6; P05 `Audit.query`) + entitlement | Adjudicates DPDP data-subject requests; records legal-basis exemptions. Privacy authority, separate from records custody. |
| **Auditor (read-only)** | **map to existing** Org-Admin audit read + read-only entitlement (RBAC §3.2; P05 query) | Read-only by construction — do **not** invent a parallel write-capable "Auditor" role (Reconciliation §C). |
| **System Administrator** | **map to** Org Admin / Platform Super Admin (RBAC §2.1) | Storage/KMS/scanner/OCR config; **cannot read CONFIDENTIAL+ content** (break-glass only, dual-control, audited to `security_audit_log`). Infrastructure power without content power. |

> **Consolidation note (usability):** *Document Owner* and *Employee (Self-Service)* are the **same human
> persona** acting on, respectively, documents they manage and their own identity records; the platform presents
> them as one **Employee** profile (Foundation §6 menu "Documents") with an optional "manages a shared cabinet"
> flag. *Librarian* (Document Admin, maker) and *Records Manager* (checker) remain distinct to preserve
> disposition SoD — enforced by P01.

> **Segregation of duties (P01/P02-enforced):** disposition approver ≠ proposing Librarian; legal-hold placer ≠
> the approver who releases it; clearance grantee ≠ grantor; no principal may both downgrade a classification and
> access the downgraded record in the same transaction; the DPO who exempts an erasure ≠ the custodian who would
> execute it. P02 multi-role **intersection** (more restrictive wins) and P01 no-self-approval enforce this.

### 3.2 Permission matrix (C=Create/Upload, R=Read/View, U=Update metadata, D=Download, P=Print, A=Approve/Decide, X=No access)

Action-level rights map to RBAC v1.7 four-layer model (Module · Field/Section · Data/row · Action: View · Edit ·
Approve/Reject · Download · Admin). Field masking is applied by **P02 on serialization** (RBAC §3.9), so an
over-broad query cannot leak a masked field.

| Capability | Doc Owner | Uploader | Librarian (Doc Admin) | Records Mgr | LH Admin | LH Approver | Security/DLP | DPO | Auditor | Sys Admin | Employee |

### 3.3 Field-level & record-level confidentiality rules (enforced by P02)

- **Clearance gates visibility — and clearance is a real, stored enterprise attribute read by P02.** A principal sees a
  document only if `effective_clearance_level ≥ document.classification` **AND** an ACL/relationship grant exists
  (deny-by-default). `effective_clearance_level` is read from the enterprise **`security_clearances`** entity
  (FR-PS13-017), defaulting to `INTERNAL` if no active clearance exists. Classifications:
  `PUBLIC < INTERNAL < CONFIDENTIAL < SECRET < TOP_SECRET`. Clearance satisfies only the classification
  dimension; P02 still applies role grant → multi-role intersection → entitlement → **PII Protection Ceiling** →
  data-scope filter → field mask on serialization (Platform §P02).
- **PII tiers / masking are RBAC v1.7 / P02, not a parallel model.** Document fields that surface enterprise
  identifiers (Aadhaar/PAN), bank, or DOB inherit Tier-1/Tier-2 masking (RBAC §3.9, §7 `V/M/H/E/AR`); `E·AR`
  fields route a change through P01, never a direct write.
- **TOP_SECRET — justification.** Retained for genuinely compartmented records (sealed CVC/vigilance PI reports,
  national-security-adjacent matters); restricted to system-seeded statutory types, mandatory dual-approver
  clearance + alerting; never hand-applied by a Librarian.
- **Sealed records** (e.g., PS09 PI reports, vigilance) carry `is_sealed=true` and are invisible to the subject
  employee even when they own related records (P02 returns 404-style "no existence" per §P02).
- **Need-to-know** restricts CONFIDENTIAL+ to principals on the document's ACL or in the originating P01 workflow.
- **Auditor** reads per clearance via P05 `Audit.query`, cannot alter; **Sys Admin** cannot read CONFIDENTIAL+
  content except break-glass (dual-control, audited to `security_audit_log`, rate-limited).

---

## 4. Shared Application Foundation (platform-grounded)

Inherits the **PrimeSoft platform** contracts wholesale (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`); the invented
`SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` conventions are overridden per Reconciliation §C.

- **Architecture:** physical stack is an engineering choice within the platform's logical architecture
  (Reconciliation §C); PS13 specifies behaviour/NFR, not framework. REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL for metadata;
  **object storage** (enterprise cloud blob) for binaries encrypted at rest; KMS for envelope keys; deployed at the
  CGG Data Centre / enterprise cloud (Standalone/Group-Company deployment model, Vision §1.4).
- **Auth (P02/§3.1):** bearer-token (JWT) session carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; never raw
  permissions — resolved per request by **P02**. Google SSO / username-password; **MFA enforced by default for
  high-privilege roles** (Records Manager, Legal Hold Approver, Security/DLP Officer, DPO).
- **Canonical error envelope (Foundation §1):** `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "field": "...",
  "details": { } } }`; correlation id in the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header**, not a body field.
- **Standard error codes (Foundation §1):** `VALIDATION_FAILED(422)`, `UNAUTHENTICATED(401)`, `FORBIDDEN(403)`,
  `NOT_FOUND(404)`, `CONFLICT(409)`, `PRECONDITION_FAILED(412)`, `RATE_LIMITED(429)`, `INTERNAL(500)` + module
  codes (§10.3). No 503 in the standard table — upstream-engine failures map via X.3 to 500/`ERR-LOADFAIL`.
- **API conventions (Foundation §1):** `/api/v1`; **Idempotency-Key** on all unsafe POSTs that create a
  transaction (24h replay returns the original); **cursor pagination** (`limit` 25/100 + `cursor`/`next_cursor`);
  `?sort=field:asc|desc`; `X-Correlation-Id`; effective-dating via `effective_from` (staged, not live).
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP ASVS, TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest, **P05 dual-log audit**, DPDP 2023, IT Act
  §3A signatures, statutory retention.
- **NFR baseline (Vision §2.9; BRD §7 — overrides invented NFR):** standard API **p95 < 500 ms @ 300 concurrent**;
  read-heavy p95 < 300 ms cached / < 1000 ms uncached; writes p95 < 1500 ms; **uptime 99.5%/month**; **RTO < 4 h,
  RPO < 1 h**; audit 100% mutation capture; **WCAG 2.1 AA**; responsive 375/768/1280 px, touch ≥ 44×44; soft

**Platform services consumed (by id, never re-authored):** **P01** WorkflowEngine (doc-gen, sign-off,
maker-checker), **P02** Authorization.check (access + field masking), **P04** integration credentials (KMS/AV/
OCR/PKI/TSA), **P05** dual audit log (view/download capture + DPDPA redaction marker), **P06** migration (legacy
document ETL+V), **X.1** job runner (`JOB-M11-*` reuse + `JOB-PS13-*` enterprise jobs), **X.2** notifications
(`MSG-M11-*` reuse + `MSG-PS13-*`), **X.3** integration framework, **W.1** process-flow definitions (document-
generation/sign-off = 23 configured doc-gen stages), **W.2** forms, **W.3** notification config, and the
**`DocumentGen.generate / sign-off`** service (Platform §Y). All provider-abstracted (storage/AV/OCR/DLP/PKI).

## Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform

This section maps every PS13 functional requirement to the platform service(s) it runs on and names the
`GAP (enterprise-specific)` extensions PS13 authors. **No engine is re-implemented.**

### A. Entity reconciliation with PrimeSoft M11 (no fork)

| PS13 entity (v3) | PrimeSoft M11 / platform anchor | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `documents` | **M11 document vault** master record | **REUSE/EXTEND** — adds enterprise columns (`classification`, `security_domain`, `is_worm`, `is_sealed`, `legal_hold_count`, `anchor_confirmed`, `dpdp_erasure_state`) + `tenant_id`/`entity_id` |
| `document_versions` / `storage_objects` | M11 vault version + blob descriptor | REUSE/EXTEND — adds `security_domain`, `key_scope`, `dek_shared`, `worm_retain_until` |
| `document_types` | **`letter_templates`** + merge-field model (`VAL-M11-MERGE`) | EXTEND — adds `allowed_signature_types`, `checkout_mode`, `default_security_domain`, WORM/TOP_SECRET flags |
| `retention_policies` / `retention_assignments` | **M11 retention classes** (`VAL-M11-RETENTION`) | REUSE/EXTEND — adds event-confirmed anchor + `requires_confirmed_anchor` |
| `signature_requests` / `signatures` | **`signoff_transactions`** + `DocumentGen` sign-off (`VAL-M11-SIGNER`) | REUSE/EXTEND — adds enterprise LTV/legal-basis |
| `disposition_records` | M11 disposal (`JOB-M11-DISPOSAL`) | REUSE/EXTEND — adds certificate + tombstone + crypto-shred guard |
| `document_audit` (access events) | **P05** dual log (`audit_log`/`security_audit_log`, DB-trigger) | RUNS ON P05; enterprise hash-chain + anchor tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** |
| `document_acls` / `folders` / `document_links` / `document_tags` / `document_shares` / `checkout_locks` / `scan_results` / `dlp_findings` | M11 vault structures + platform document service | REUSE/EXTEND |
| **`security_clearances`** | — | **GAP (enterprise-specific)** — read by P02 |
| **`legal_holds` / `legal_hold_items` / `hold_notices`** | — | **GAP (enterprise-specific)** — runs on P01 (SoD) + P05 |
| **`data_subject_requests`** | `consent_records` + DPDPA erasure (Vision §2.7) | **GAP (enterprise-specific)** — uses **P05 redaction-marker path + JOB-M11-DISPOSAL** |
| **`audit_anchors`** | P05 OPEN-PLAT-03 hash-chain proposal | **GAP (enterprise-specific)** — statutory tamper-evidence |
| **`lifecycle_event_inbox`** | platform outbox/event bus | **GAP (enterprise-specific)** — anchor recompute |
| **WORM** (`storage_objects.storage_class`, `worm_retain_until`) | — (M11 lacks WORM) | **GAP (enterprise-specific)** |
| `signature_ltv_artifacts` | — | **GAP (enterprise-specific)** — IT Act §3A LTV durability |

### B. FR → platform service map

| FR | Runs on / consumes | GAP (enterprise-specific) authored |
|----|--------------------|------------------------------|
| FR-PS13-001 Upload & Ingestion | M11 vault ingest; `VAL-FILE`; ScanProvider; X.1 | domain-scoped dedup, anti-oracle |

| FR-PS13-021 Redaction (Phase 2) | `DocumentGen` rendition; sandbox; OCR | irreversible redaction |

### C. Validation, jobs, messages, errors — reuse vs author

- **Reuse (cite, never restate):** `VAL-FILE`, `VAL-M11-MERGE`, `VAL-M11-RETENTION`, `VAL-M11-SIGNER`,
  `VAL-CONSENT`, `VAL-COMMENT`, `VAL-ENUM`, `VAL-DATE`, `VAL-EFFECTIVE`, `VAL-AADHAAR`, `VAL-PAN`, `VAL-IFSC`;

  published, letter-issued, sign-off assigned/remind/declined, disposal-due); shared `ERR-FORBIDDEN`,
  `ERR-LOADFAIL`, `ERR-PRECOND`, `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`, `ERR-REASON-REQ`, `MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL`.
- **Author as enterprise-specific (register in Foundation §2/§4/§5):** `VAL-PS13-WORM` (WORM extend-only, no shorten),
  `VAL-PS13-CLEARANCE` (maker≠checker, level legality), `VAL-PS13-HOLD-SOD` (hold release dual-control),
  `VAL-PS13-DEDUP-DOMAIN` (domain-scoped dedup, no cross-classification), `VAL-PS13-FETCH-INTENT` (intent required),
  `VAL-PS13-LATTICE` (DPDP precedence), `VAL-PS13-LTV` (statutory LTV required), `VAL-PS13-SIGMETHOD` (allowed
  signature method); `JOB-PS13-ANCHOR` (audit anchoring), `JOB-PS13-CHAINVERIFY`, `JOB-PS13-HOLDEVAL` (continuous
  hold eval), `JOB-PS13-ORPHAN`, `JOB-PS13-INTEGRITY`, `JOB-PS13-CLEARANCE-RECERT`, `JOB-PS13-KEYROTATE`;
  `MSG-PS13-*` (quarantine, hold placed/released, clearance, DSR, integrity/chain alerts, key-DR posture);
  `ERR-PS13-*` module error codes (§10.3).

## Amendments (v3 → v3.1: cross-module remediation)

Applies the authoritative cross-module remediation decisions (`docs/review/REMEDIATION.md` D3; integration review
`docs/review/R4-id-registry-collisions.md`, Findings 2 & 3). **Surgical edits only** — no FR, entity, rule, state
table, or NFR was changed; only error-code identifiers were namespaced and the collision resolved.

| # | R-ref | v3 (as authored) | v3.1 (remediated) | Where |
|---|-------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| A | R4 #2 (High) | ~34 module error codes defined as bare `UPPER_SNAKE` strings (e.g. `MALWARE_DETECTED`, `WORM_IMMUTABLE`, `SOD_VIOLATION`) in live FR failure-handling, API examples, and the §10.3 catalog | **All module codes namespaced `ERR-PS13-<NAME>`** (96 occurrences across FR/API/§10.3), each mapped onto one of the 8 standard HTTP codes; §10.3 is the canonical `ERR-PS13-* → HTTP → message id` mapping table | FR-PS13-001…021 failure cells, §10.2–10.4 examples, §10.3 catalog |
| B | R4 #3 (Med) | bare `SIGNATURE_INVALID` — string-identical to PS12's order-signature code with a divergent meaning (cross-module collision) | Namespaced **`ERR-PS13-SIGNATURE_INVALID`**; explicit note that **PS12 owns `ERR-PS12-…`** and neither module emits the other's namespace | §10.3 catalog + footnote; FR-PS13-010 |
| C | R4 #2/§4 | Standard 8-code table retained; `VALIDATION_FAILED`/`FORBIDDEN`/`CONFLICT`/etc. used as HTTP-status codes alongside `ERR-PS13-*` | Unchanged — confirmed **no invented `VALIDATION_ERROR`/`AUTH_REQUIRED`/`503`/`UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`** leaks in any live section (those remain only in the v2→v3 override table, row 4); former-upstream failures already map to `INTERNAL 500` via X.3 | §4, §10.1, §10.3 |
| D | R4 §A.2/§C | Shared platform ids `VAL-M11-MERGE/RETENTION/SIGNER`, `MSG-M11-*`, `JOB-M11-BULKLTR/RETENTION/DISPOSAL/SIGNOFF-REMIND` | Unchanged — **confirmed cited, never redefined** (Alignment §C "Reuse (cite, never restate)") | Alignment §C, §2.1 |

> **Preservation guarantee (v3.1).** This amendment is an identifier-hygiene pass only. Every functional
> requirement, acceptance criterion, business rule, data-integrity rule, state transition, NFR, and council
> mitigation (R1–R22) is retained verbatim; only the spelling of module error-code identifiers changed.

---

## Amendments (v3.1 → v3.2: field reconciliation)

Reconciles the PS13 data model to the ground-truth **DwnB "Additional Config" CSV exports** and the **PrimeSoft
prototype document-management screens** (schema source of truth: `docs/data-model/13-PS13-document-management.sql`
SECTIONS F & G; reconciliation reports: `docs/data-model/reconciliation/ps13-documents.md` and
`docs/data-model/reconciliation/prototype-ps13-documents.md`). **Surgical, add-only edits** — no existing entity,
FR, rule, state table, enum, or NFR was changed; only new PS13-owned config masters and letter-gen/acknowledgement
DATA entities (that the schema now carries and the BRD lacked) were **added** to §5, with brief cross-references
in the affected FRs.

| # | Added entity (E-#) | Kind | Source | Where in §5 |
|---|--------------------|------|--------|-------------|
| A | `document_categories` (E27) | CONFIG master | CSV export `Document_Category_-Export.csv` (DarwinBox "Document Category", `DOCCAT_N`) | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| B | `document_category_profile_fields` (E28) | CONFIG master (child) | CSV export `Document_Category_-Export.csv` ("Select Employee Profile Fields" comma-list) | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| C | `document_template_name_formats` (E29) | CONFIG master | CSV export `Document_Template_Name_Formats_Export_1_.csv` (`DOCFORMAT_N`) | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| D | `policy_letter_settings` (E30) | CONFIG master | CSV export `Policy_And_Letter_Settings_-Export.csv` (per-company) | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| E | `self_generate_settings` (E31) | CONFIG master | CSV export `Self_Generate_Setings_-Export.csv` (`SELFGEN_N`) | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| F | `merge_field_catalog` (E32) | Reference catalogue | Prototype screen `da-merge-fields` (`{{token}}` → source) | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| G | `letter_generation_requests` (E33) | DATA | Prototype screen `da-letter-queue` / `my-letters` | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| H | `bulk_letter_jobs` (E34) | DATA | Prototype screen `da-bulk-letters` | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| I | `acknowledgement_campaigns` (E35) | DATA | Prototype screens `da-ack-campaign` / `da-signoff-tracker` | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |
| J | `document_acknowledgements` (E36) | DATA | Prototype screens `policy-ack` / `documents-oversight` / `da-signoff-tracker` (DM25 non-repudiation) | §5.1, §5.2, §5.4 |

**New enums added to §5.5:** `ps13_config_status` (CSV "Status"), `ps13_letter_request_status`,
`ps13_bulk_job_status`, `ps13_ack_campaign_status`, `ps13_ack_status`.

**FR cross-references (brief, no FR rewritten):** FR-PS13-002 (document categories / template name formats /
self-generate settings), FR-PS13-010 (letter-generation queue, bulk letters, merge-field catalogue), FR-PS13-012
(policy/letter acknowledgement campaigns + per-employee non-repudiation acknowledgement records).

> **Not added (config / derived / other-module-owned, per the recon reports):** the M11 letter-template register
> (`document_types.letter_template_ref` logical ref), the policy library / policy categories (documents + tags +
> derived counts), document-cluster templates & onboarding progress (PS02/M02 config), storage infra/DR telemetry,
> and letter-head / signing-authority / UAG-population masters (stored as **logical refs**, no cross-module FK).

> **Preservation guarantee (v3.2).** Every v2/v3/v3.1 entity, FR, acceptance criterion, business rule,
> data-integrity rule, state transition, NFR, notification, and council mitigation (R1–R22) is retained verbatim.
> This amendment is additive only — it homes ground-truth config/DATA fields the schema reconciliation surfaced.

---

## 5. Holistic Data Model

> **Tenancy (Platform §0.1, Reconciliation §C).** **Every PS13 entity below carries `tenant_id` (non-nullable)
> and, where entity-scoped, `entity_id`.** These are omitted from each field table for brevity but are mandatory;
> all access is scoped at the persistence layer and an unscoped query is rejected. `audit_log` /
> `security_audit_log` / `workflows` / `workflow_instances` / `workflow_actions` / `notifications` /
> `consent_records` / `integration_credentials` / `migration_runs` are **platform-provided** (P05/P01/P04/P06,
> X.2) and are **referenced, never redefined**.

### 5.6 Data integrity rules

- **DI-1:** `documents.current_version_id` references a `document_versions` row of the same document;
  `current_version_no` equals that version's `version_no`.
- **DI-2:** `document_versions` is append-only — corrections are a new version or supersede.
- **DI-3 (R5, OPEN-PLAT-03):** `document_audit` is append-only AND **hash-chained** (`row_hash` =
  SHA-256(payload ‖ prev_hash)), periodically summarised into `audit_anchors` and anchored to WORM/notary/TSA;
  a broken chain raises `ERR-PS13-AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN`. Runs on the P05 substrate; tamper-evidence tracks OPEN-PLAT-03.
- **DI-4:** A document with `legal_hold_count > 0` or `is_worm = true` cannot be soft-deleted, disposed, or
  content-overwritten before `worm_retain_until`.
- **DI-5:** `content_hash` must equal SHA-256 of stored bytes; mismatch sets `integrity_verified=false`, blocks `ACTIVE`.
- **DI-6 (R1/R9):** Dedup is **domain-scoped** — reuse only when `content_hash` AND `security_domain` AND
  `key_scope` match (HMAC `dedup_index_key`). Cross-domain dedup forbidden. `ref_count>1` ⇒ `dek_shared=true`,
  no crypto-shred. No user-visible dedup signal.
- **DI-7:** One `ACTIVE` `checkout_locks` per `document_id`; check-out only where `checkout_mode ≠ NONE`.
- **DI-8:** `document_acls` DENY overrides ALLOW; absence of ALLOW = no access (deny-by-default; **P02**).
- **DI-9:** `classification` downgraded only by Security/DLP via **P01 maker-checker**; upgrades by Librarian.
  Sealed/WORM not downgradable below type default. TOP_SECRET only on `is_top_secret_eligible` types.
- **DI-10:** `disposition_records` requires `approved_by ≠ proposed_by` (P01); EXECUTED only if no active hold
  AND (`requires_confirmed_anchor=false` OR `anchor_confirmed=true`).
- **DI-11:** Every `document_versions` insert is preceded by a `scan_results` row `malware_verdict=CLEAN` before
  it may become `current`.
- **DI-12:** EXTERNAL_LINK shares require `expires_at` not null and `token_hash` set; after N failed password
  attempts, `status=LOCKED` (R16).
- **DI-13:** `disposition_due_date` is null iff governing class `is_permanent=true`.
- **DI-14:** PS01–PS12 references to `documents` are validated on attach via `document_links`; a module entity may
  not point at a `DELETED`/`DISPOSED`/`ORPHANED` document.
- **DI-15 (R8 — DPDP precedence lattice):** ERASURE precedence = **statutory retention / active legal hold /
  WORM-before-retain-until → override erasure** (`EXEMPT_RETAINED`, basis recorded). Only where none applies is
  erasure fulfilled, via **domain-local crypto-shred** (`dek_shared=false`) or PHYSICAL_PURGE — executed on the
  **P05 redaction-marker path + `JOB-M11-DISPOSAL`**.
- **DI-16 (R3):** Every access decision resolves `effective_clearance_level` from `security_clearances`
  (default INTERNAL) and requires it ≥ `classification`; **P02 reads it**. Grants require maker≠checker (P01).
- **DI-17 (R11):** Releasing a hold requires `release_approved_by ≠ release_proposed_by` + a non-null reason;
  high-value placement requires `placement_approved_by` (P01).
- **DI-18 (R12):** A `lifecycle_event_inbox` row is processed idempotently by `dedupe_key`; an unconfirmed event
  may set a provisional anchor but must NOT flip `anchor_confirmed=true`.

## 6. Functional Requirements

> Every FR runs on the platform services named in **Alignment §B**. Maker-checker is a **configured P01 flow
> (W.1)**; access checks call **`Authorization.check` (P02)**; access is audited to **P05**; jobs run on **X.1**;
> notifications via **X.2/W.3**. Validation cites `VAL-*` ids and authors only `VAL-PS13-*`.

### FR-PS13-001 — Document Upload & Ingestion (single, bulk, drag-drop, scanner, mobile)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Document Owner, Uploader (module service), DMS Librarian (Document Admin), Employee

**User Story:** As an uploader, I want to add documents via web (single/bulk/drag-drop), scanner ingestion,
mobile capture, or the attach API, so that content enters the **M11 vault** safely, with the right type and
metadata, and becomes searchable and governed.

**Description:** Ingests binaries through a multi-step pipeline on the M11 vault: pre-flight validation
(`VAL-FILE` type/size) → secure upload (multipart/resumable) → malware scan (archive limits, R17) → integrity
hash → **domain-scoped dedup** → metadata capture (W.2 form) → sandboxed OCR/preview → `ACTIVE`. Supports
single/bulk uploads, drag-drop, watched scanner folders, mobile capture, and the programmatic attach API used by
PS01–PS12. Dedup hits are never surfaced (no existence oracle, R9).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A document is created with `document_type_id`, `title`, target `folder_id`, type-required metadata, `tenant_id`/`entity_id`.
2. Files violating `allowed_mime_types`/`max_size_mb` are rejected pre-upload (`VAL-FILE`) with `ERR-PS13-INVALID_FILE_TYPE`/`ERR-PS13-FILE_TOO_LARGE`.
3. Every upload is virus-scanned before `ACTIVE`; infected files go to `QUARANTINED` (FR-PS13-007).
4. Bulk upload accepts up to 100 files per batch, returning per-file success/failure without aborting.
5. Resumable upload supports files up to the configured cap (default 250 MB) and survives transient loss.
6. On success the response returns `documentId`, `docNo`, `status`, `currentVersionNo=1`; **P05 captures the mutation (DB-trigger)** and a chained `document_audit (VERSION_ADD)` access row is written.
7. The response NEVER indicates whether content was deduplicated; timing is normalised (R9).
8. The unsafe POST accepts an **`Idempotency-Key`**; a 24h replay returns the original result, not a duplicate.

**Business Rules:**
- BR-1: `status` flows DRAFT → SCANNING → (CLEAN ⇒ ACTIVE | INFECTED ⇒ QUARANTINED).
- BR-2: Default classification = `document_types.default_classification` unless caller specifies higher; `security_domain` defaults from the type.
- BR-3: Scanner/mobile sources auto-OCR; system-generated PDFs (e.g., payslips) skip OCR but still index text.
- BR-4: Module attach (API) must include `module_code`, `entity_name`, `entity_ref_id`, `link_role` (FR-PS13-003).
- BR-5: Dedup reuse occurs only within the same `security_domain` + `key_scope` (DI-6).

**Data Model:** `documents`, `document_versions`, `storage_objects`, `scan_results`, `document_links`.

**API:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/documents` | Create + upload (single, multipart) |
| POST | `/api/v1/documents/bulk` | Bulk upload batch |
| POST | `/api/v1/documents/{id}/uploads:resume` | Resumable upload session |
| POST | `/api/v1/documents:attach` | Module attach contract (PS01–PS12) |

**LLD:** Validate `VAL-FILE` → presigned/resumable PUT to staging → SHA-256 + HMAC dedup key → domain-scoped
dedup lookup → AV scan (ScanProvider, archive guards) → on CLEAN promote blob, write
`storage_objects`+`document_versions`+`documents` in a transaction → enqueue sandboxed OCR/preview (X.1) →
P05 captures mutations; chained access audit emitted. Failure: type/size ⇒ 422 `VALIDATION_FAILED`/module code;
infected ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-MALWARE_DETECTED`; archive bomb ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-RENDER_RESOURCE_LIMIT`; storage down ⇒ X.3-mapped 500
`ERR-LOADFAIL` with resumable retry. Dependencies: KMS, object storage, AV/OCR providers, PS01 employee context.

### FR-PS13-002 — Document Types, Metadata Taxonomy, Classification, Tagging & Signature/Checkout Policy

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** DMS Librarian (Document Admin), Security/DLP Officer, Uploader

**User Story:** As a Librarian, I want to define document types (extending the M11 `letter_templates`/merge-field
model) with a metadata schema, defaults, allowed signature methods, and check-out behaviour, so that every
document is consistently described, classified, signed lawfully, and discoverable.

**Description:** Manages the `document_types` taxonomy (JSON-Schema realised as a **W.2 form** referencing
`VAL-*`; default classification/domain/retention-class, allowed MIME/size via `VAL-FILE`, WORM/signature
defaults, allowed signature methods, checkout mode), the classification ladder, and tagging (controlled + free +
auto-applied by OCR/DLP). Where a type is generated rather than uploaded, it links a M11 `letter_template`
(`VAL-M11-MERGE` — every `${token}` resolves). Reclassification downgrade is a **P01 maker-checker** flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A type defines `metadata_schema`, `default_classification`, `default_security_domain`, `allowed_mime_types`, `max_size_mb`, `allowed_signature_types`, `signature_legal_basis`, `checkout_mode`, optional `letter_template_ref`.
2. Uploads validate metadata against the W.2 form/JSON-Schema; missing required fields fail `VALIDATION_FAILED`/`ERR-PS13-METADATA_INVALID`.
3. A document carries exactly one `classification`; changes write chained `document_audit (CLASSIFY)`.
4. Downgrading classification requires Security/DLP + a distinct approver via **P01** + a reason (`VAL-COMMENT`).
5. Tags can be user-applied (controlled vocab, `VAL-ENUM`) and auto-applied by OCR/DLP with a confidence score.
6. Deactivating a type prevents new uploads but preserves existing documents.
7. Statutory types exclude `DRAWN` and pin a `signature_legal_basis` (R7); TOP_SECRET selectable only when `is_top_secret_eligible=true`.
8. Generated types resolve every merge `${token}` against the M11 catalogue before publish (`VAL-M11-MERGE`).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 classification raised by Librarian, lowered only by Security/DLP via P01 (DI-9). BR-2
DLP PII tags auto-suggest CONFIDENTIAL minimum. BR-3 controlled vocab rejects unknown keys. BR-4 `checkout_mode`
defaults OPTIONAL (R22).

**Data Model:** `document_types`, `document_tags`, `documents`, `dlp_findings`, (`letter_templates` ref).

> **RECON note (v3.2):** the tenant-configurable **`document_categories`** (+ `document_category_profile_fields`)
> master groups employee document/profile fields under a named category (`DOCCAT_N`) — distinct from the closed
> `ps13_doc_category` enum; **`document_template_name_formats`** (`DOCFORMAT_N`) defines generated-document file
> naming; **`self_generate_settings`** (`SELFGEN_N`) holds self-service letter-generation defaults. See §5.2
> (E27–E31).

**API:** `POST/PUT /api/v1/document-types`, `GET /api/v1/document-types`, `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/tags`,
`POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:reclassify` (P01 maker-checker).

**LLD:** CRUD types with schema-version pin + signature/checkout policy → validate uploads against pinned W.2
form → reclassify routes through a **configured P01 flow**. Failure: bad schema ⇒ 422; unauthorised downgrade ⇒
403 `ERR-PS13-CLASSIFICATION_LOCKED`; metadata mismatch ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-METADATA_INVALID`; illegal method ⇒ 422
`ERR-PS13-SIGNATURE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`; unbound merge token ⇒ 422 (`VAL-M11-MERGE`). Dependencies: P01, DLP (FR-016),
M11 `letter_templates`.

### FR-PS13-003 — Folder/Cabinet Structure & Module-Context Linking (Attach Contract)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** DMS Librarian, Uploader (module service), System (auto-provision)

**User Story:** As a module service (PS01–PS12), I want to attach a document to my business object and place it in
the correct cabinet, so that documents are organised by employee/module/case context and reliably retrievable.

**Description:** Manages the folder hierarchy (auto-provisioned per employee and per module/case) and the
polymorphic **attach contract** (`document_links`) — the platform document service every enterprise module consumes.
Maintains `documents.link_count` so the orphan reaper (FR-PS13-019) can detect zero-link documents. Folders carry
inheritable classification and ACLs (read by P02).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A per-employee cabinet auto-creates on PS01 employee creation; module/case subfolders auto-provision on first attach.
2. `documents:attach` links a document to a PS01–PS12 entity and returns `linkId`; `is_primary` unique per (entity, link_role); increments `link_count`. Accepts `Idempotency-Key`.
3. A document can be linked from multiple modules (re-use) without duplicating the binary.
4. Moving a document between folders preserves version history, P05 audit, retention, and holds.
5. Folder-level ACLs inherited unless overridden by a document-level DENY (P02 deny-by-default).
6. Detaching a link sets `detached_at`, decrements `link_count`; at 0 the document becomes an orphan candidate (FR-PS13-019).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 a `DELETED`/`DISPOSED`/`ORPHANED` document cannot be attached (DI-14). BR-2 system folders
not renamable/deletable by non-admins. BR-3 folder classification sets the floor for contained documents.

**Data Model:** `folders`, `document_links`, `document_acls`, `documents`.

`GET /api/v1/documents?moduleCode=&entityRefId=&limit=&cursor=` (cursor pagination).

**LLD:** Resolve/auto-provision folder path → attach validates document state + caller scope (P02) → insert link
+ increment link_count → recompute inherited ACLs. Failure: disposed/orphaned doc ⇒ 409
`ERR-PS13-DOCUMENT_NOT_ATTACHABLE`; duplicate primary ⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-LINK_CONFLICT`. Dependencies: PS01 lifecycle events, all

### FR-PS13-004 — Versioning, Optional Check-in/Check-out & Supersede

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Document Owner, Uploader, DMS Librarian

**User Story:** As a document owner, I want to add new versions and (where the type requires it) check a document
out, so that change history is preserved and concurrent edits never collide.

**Description:** Provides immutable version history on the M11 vault, **optional** exclusive check-out/check-in
locks (per `document_types.checkout_mode`), new-version upload, and **supersede**. Check-out is OPTIONAL by
default, NONE for read-only statutory types, REQUIRED only where a type demands serialized edits (R22).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. For `checkout_mode ∈ {OPTIONAL, REQUIRED}`, checking out creates an exclusive `ACTIVE` lock; REQUIRED rejects check-in without a held lock.
2. Check-in increments `version_no`, sets new `current_version_id`, requires `change_summary`, runs the full scan pipeline.
3. Version history lists all versions (author, timestamp, size, hash, kind, summary); any version downloadable per P02.
4. Supersede records `version_kind=SUPERSEDE` + `superseded_version_id`; superseded version retained.
5. Locks auto-expire after TTL (default 8h); admin force-release with reason (audited to P05).
6. WORM documents reject content mutation before `worm_retain_until`.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 only lock holder/force-release admin may check in. BR-2 new version inherits
classification/domain/retention/holds/links. BR-3 supersede requires Librarian/owner right + reason. BR-4
`checkout_mode=NONE` adds versions directly with optimistic-concurrency guard.

**Data Model:** `document_versions`, `checkout_locks`, `documents`, `scan_results`.

**API:** `:checkout`, `:checkin`, `:supersede`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/versions`.

**LLD:** Checkout acquires unique lock (SELECT…FOR UPDATE) → check-in validates lock/optimistic version → scan →
append version in txn → advance current pointer → release lock; P05 captures. Failure: locked ⇒ 409
`ERR-PS13-DOCUMENT_LOCKED`; not holder ⇒ 403; WORM ⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-WORM_IMMUTABLE`; checkout on NONE ⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-CHECKOUT_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
Dependencies: FR-PS13-005/007/014.

### FR-PS13-005 — Encryption at Rest (Envelope/KMS), In Transit & Key Disaster Recovery

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Security/DLP Officer, System Administrator (Org/Platform Admin), System

**User Story:** As a Security Officer, I want every stored binary encrypted with envelope encryption under a KMS
key (credentials via P04), all transfers over TLS, keys rotatable, and a tested key-DR/escrow plan, so content
is protected and no key loss can darken the archive.

**Description:** Envelope encryption: a per-object DEK encrypts the blob (AES-256-GCM); the DEK is wrapped by a
KMS CMK (`wrapped_dek`). CONFIDENTIAL+ use a dedicated CMK per security domain. KMS integration credentials are
stored/rotated via **P04 `integration_credentials`**. All traffic TLS 1.2+. Supports key rotation (re-wrap DEKs
without re-encrypting blobs, `JOB-PS13-KEYROTATE`). Adds key-DR/escrow (R6): CMK backup, multi-region/HSM
replication, recovery runbook, defined key-loss behaviour. Break-glass is dual-control, audited to
`security_audit_log`, rate-limited (R16).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every blob stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM) with a unique DEK; plaintext never persisted.
2. The DEK is wrapped by a KMS CMK; only `wrapped_dek` + `kms_key_id` stored.
3. All transport TLS 1.2+; non-TLS rejected at the gateway.
4. CMK rotation re-wraps DEKs in the background (`JOB-PS13-KEYROTATE`) without rewriting object bytes.
5. Decryption requires an authorised principal (P02); every decrypt-for-download audited (FR-PS13-012).
6. Break-glass requires two approvers, records `document_audit (BREAK_GLASS)` + `security_audit_log`, locks after repeated failures (`ERR-PS13-BREAK_GLASS_LOCKED`).
7. CMKs backed up/escrowed (multi-region/HSM); rehearsed recovery runbook; defined key-loss behaviour (R6).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 CONFIDENTIAL+ use dedicated CMK per domain. BR-2 keys never leave KMS in plaintext.
BR-3 retired/compromised key forces re-wrap. BR-4 shared blob (`dek_shared=true`) never crypto-shredded (DI-6).
BR-5 CMK replicated to an in-country HSM/region; restore tested quarterly. BR-6 recovery runbook before any data
is declared lost.

**Data Model:** `storage_objects`, `documents`, `document_audit`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/admin/keys:rotate`, `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:break-glass`,
`GET /api/v1/admin/encryption/status`, `POST /api/v1/admin/keys:recover` (dual-control).

**LLD:** On store: generate DEK → encrypt → KMS-wrap → persist. On read: KMS-unwrap → decrypt stream → chained
audit. DR: escrow replication continuous; recovery dual-control. Failure: KMS down ⇒ X.3-mapped 500
`ERR-PS13-KEY_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (no plaintext fallback); unauthorised decrypt ⇒ 403; break-glass lockout ⇒ 429
`ERR-PS13-BREAK_GLASS_LOCKED`. Dependencies: KMS (+ HSM/multi-region escrow via P04), object storage, FR-PS13-012.

### FR-PS13-006 — Access Control (P02 + Relationship + Clearance + Classification + Need-to-Know)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Security/DLP Officer, DMS Librarian, all readers

**User Story:** As a Security Officer, I want access decided by RBAC role, org-relationship, a defined clearance
attribute, classification, and explicit need-to-know with deny-by-default, so only entitled principals can see
each document at record and field level.

**Description:** Access is enforced by **`Authorization.check` (P02)** — endpoints never re-implement permission
logic. P02 resolution: deny-by-default → role grant (RBAC §5.1) → multi-role **intersection** (more restrictive)
→ individual entitlement → capability flag → **PII Protection Ceiling** (overrides upward) → data-scope filter →
**field mask on serialization**. PS13 contributes two resource attributes P02 evaluates: (a) the document
`classification`/`is_sealed`/`document_acls`, and (b) the principal's `effective_clearance_level` from
`security_clearances` (FR-PS13-017, default INTERNAL). The clearance gate requires
`effective_clearance_level ≥ classification`. List/search results are masked to metadata-only for restricted
records (P02 mask-on-serialization).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Access granted only when RBAC right AND `effective_clearance_level ≥ classification` AND an effective ALLOW hold, no DENY — resolved by P02.
2. A reporting manager views a direct report's permitted documents via the `REPORTING_MANAGER` relationship grant (RBAC scoping dimension).
3. Sealed documents are invisible to the subject employee even when they own related records (P02 404-style, no existence leak).
4. Need-to-know ACLs require P01 workflow membership in addition to role.
5. Denied access is recorded as chained `document_audit (result=DENIED)` + `security_audit_log` with reason.
6. Time-boxed ACLs (`expires_at`) auto-revoke (platform entitlement-expiry job).
7. Clearance read live; SUSPENDED/EXPIRED/REVOKED immediately denies CONFIDENTIAL+ access.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 DENY always wins (DI-8). BR-2 folder ACLs inherit unless document-level DENY. BR-3
Auditor reads per clearance; Sys Admin cannot read CONFIDENTIAL+ except break-glass. BR-4 missing clearance
defaults INTERNAL (DI-16).

**Data Model:** `document_acls`, `documents`, `folders`, `security_clearances`, `document_audit`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/acls`, `DELETE /api/v1/acls/{aclId}`,
`GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/access:check`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/acls`.

**LLD:** Each access calls `Authorization.check({subject(roles,scope), action, resource_ref, fields[]})` →
`{allowed, scope_filter, field_mask[]}`; PS13 supplies clearance + classification + ACLs as resource context.
Failure: denied ⇒ 403 `FORBIDDEN`/`ERR-PS13-CLEARANCE_INSUFFICIENT` + audited DENIED; sealed ⇒ 404. Dependencies: **P02**,
PS01 relationships/org, FR-PS13-017, FR-PS13-012.

### FR-PS13-007 — Virus/Malware Scanning, File-Type & Size Validation, Quarantine & Render Sandboxing

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Security/DLP Officer, System

**User Story:** As a Security Officer, I want every upload validated, malware-scanned, and processed in
resource-limited sandboxes before it becomes available.

**Description:** Validates file type by magic-byte sniffing, enforces per-type size caps (`VAL-FILE`), scans
every version via `ScanProvider` (ICAP/cloud), and enforces **archive/decompression limits** (R17). Infected
files are quarantined (encrypted, isolated). All content-processing (OCR/preview/render) runs in **sandboxed,
resource-limited workers**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. File type determined by content signature; mismatched extension never trusted.
2. Files exceeding `max_size_mb` rejected pre-storage (`VAL-FILE`).
3. Every version scanned; only `CLEAN` versions become `current`/`ACTIVE`.
4. Infected files `QUARANTINED`, encrypted, hidden; Security notified via X.2 (`MSG-PS13-QUARANTINE`).
5. Quarantine release requires Security/DLP approval.
6. On AV signature update, pending/quarantined items can be re-scanned.
7. Archive depth/ratio/nesting limits enforced; violations ⇒ `ERR-PS13-RENDER_RESOURCE_LIMIT`, recorded in `scan_results` (R17).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 no `ACTIVE` with `scan_status≠CLEAN` (DI-11). BR-2 quarantined binaries never served.
BR-3 repeated infections raise a security alert. BR-4 OCR/preview/render run in ephemeral sandboxes with CPU/
memory/time caps; a breach cannot reach KMS or the metadata DB.

**Data Model:** `scan_results`, `documents`, `document_versions`.

**API:** `GET /api/v1/admin/quarantine`, `POST /api/v1/admin/quarantine/{id}:release`,
`POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:rescan`.

**LLD:** Sniff MIME + size guard (`VAL-FILE`) → archive depth/ratio guard → stream to AV → record verdict →
CLEAN promotes, INFECTED quarantines + alerts (X.2); all extraction in sandbox. Failure: AV down ⇒ keep
SCANNING + retry; infected ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-MALWARE_DETECTED`; bomb ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-RENDER_RESOURCE_LIMIT`. Dependencies: ScanProvider,
sandbox runtime, FR-PS13-001/004.

### FR-PS13-008 — Sandboxed OCR & Permission-Aware Search (Secured Index)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** All readers, DMS Librarian

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search documents by content and metadata with permission-aware results.

**Description:** Runs OCR (sandboxed, `OcrProvider`) on image/scan uploads, indexes content + metadata into a
full-text engine (`IndexProvider`) **encrypted at rest and access-scoped** (R7). **SECRET/TOP_SECRET full text
is excluded** (metadata-only) or routed to a separately-secured per-domain index; results are **post-filtered by
P02** (not rank suppression). Multi-language (en/hi/te) OCR.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Scanned images/PDFs OCR'd in sandboxed workers; `ocr_status` reflects PENDING/DONE/FAILED/NOT_APPLICABLE.
2. Search returns only documents the principal may view (P02 + clearance filtered) with highlighted snippets.
3. Faceted filters (type, classification, date, folder, tag, owner); **cursor-paginated** (limit 25/100).
4. Metadata and OCR text searchable; restricted docs show metadata-only snippet.
5. Re-indexing on new versions and metadata changes.
6. Index encrypted at rest + access-scoped; SECRET/TOP_SECRET excluded from full-text (R7).
7. Multi-language detected (`language_code`) and indexed with the right analyzer.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 search never returns content a principal cannot access (P02 post-filter). BR-2 OCR
failure does not block storage. BR-3 sealed/quarantined excluded from non-privileged search. BR-4 no plaintext
SECRET/TOP_SECRET tokens in the shared index (R7).

**Data Model:** `document_versions`, `scan_results`, `documents`, `document_tags`.

**API:** `GET /api/v1/documents/search?q=&type=&class=&from=&to=&limit=&cursor=`,
`POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:reindex`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/ocr`.

**LLD:** On version DONE → sandboxed extract/OCR → index (full-text for ≤CONFIDENTIAL; metadata-only SECRET+) →
query applies P02 ACL+clearance filter + facets → highlight. Failure: index down ⇒ fallback to metadata DB
search; OCR fail ⇒ mark FAILED. Dependencies: OcrProvider, IndexProvider (encrypted), **P02**.

### FR-PS13-009 — Retention (M11 classes), Legal Hold (SoD + Future-Match) & Event-Driven Disposition

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** DMS Librarian, Records Manager, Legal Hold Administrator, Legal Hold Approver

**User Story:** As a Records Manager, I want documents governed by **M11 retention classes**, frozen by legal
holds (enterprise extension, dual control + future-match capture), and disposed only via approved/certified process on a
confirmed anchor.

**Description:** Assigns **M11 retention classes** (`VAL-M11-RETENTION`), computes disposition-due dates from
**event-confirmed anchors** (R12), places/releases legal holds with **SoD on placement (high-value) and release**
via **P01** (R10), runs a **continuous-evaluation job** (`JOB-PS13-HOLDEVAL`) that auto-adds future documents
matching `match_criteria` and issues custodian hold-notices (X.2) requiring acknowledgement (R11), and runs the
disposition maker-checker on **P01** ending in **`JOB-M11-RETENTION`** (flag due) → **`JOB-M11-DISPOSAL`**
(execute approved disposal / DPDPA erasure via P05 redaction marker). Holds always override disposition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A retention class is assignable at document/type/folder scope; effective class resolves most-specific-first.
2. `disposition_due_date` = anchor + period; permanent classes leave it null.
3. Placing a hold sets `legal_hold_count>0`, blocks disposition/delete/overwrite, marks assignment `HELD`; high-value holds require `placement_approved_by` (P01, R10).
4. Disposition requires proposal (Librarian) + approval (Records Manager) via P01, `proposed_by ≠ approved_by`.
5. Disposition executes only when no active hold AND confirmed anchor; produces a `disposition_records` row with certificate + tombstone via `JOB-M11-DISPOSAL` (DI-10, R12).
6. Releasing a hold requires `release_proposed_by` + distinct `release_approved_by` + mandatory `release_reason` (`VAL-PS13-HOLD-SOD`, R10), then restores eligibility.
7. `JOB-PS13-HOLDEVAL` auto-adds new documents matching an ACTIVE hold's `match_criteria` (`is_auto_added=true`) and issues `hold_notices` (X.2) requiring acknowledgement (R11).
8. Due dates (re)computed from `lifecycle_event_inbox` confirmed events; an unconfirmed/corrected anchor blocks auto-DESTROY (R12).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 hold overrides any retention/disposition (DI-4/DI-10). BR-2 statutory types (SR, PPO)
default permanent/REVIEW. BR-3 destruction is logical+physical (blob purged or crypto-shred if unshared,
tombstone + certificate). BR-4 hold release dual-control via P01 (DI-17). BR-5 auto-DESTROY blocked unless anchor
confirmed (DI-18). BR-6 overdue hold-notices escalate to LH Approver (X.2).

**Data Model:** `retention_policies`/`_assignments`, `legal_holds`/`_items`/`hold_notices`,
`lifecycle_event_inbox`, `disposition_records`, `documents`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/retention-policies`, `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/retention`,
`POST /api/v1/legal-holds` / `:release`, `:approve-placement`, `POST /api/v1/hold-notices/{id}:acknowledge`,
`POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/disposition:propose` / `:approve`.

**LLD:** Resolve effective class → consume confirmed anchor event → compute due → `JOB-M11-RETENTION` flags DUE →
P01 propose/approve → `JOB-M11-DISPOSAL` executes purge+certificate if no hold AND confirmed anchor;
`JOB-PS13-HOLDEVAL` matches new docs, auto-holds, issues notices. Failure: hold present ⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-LEGAL_HOLD_ACTIVE`;
self-approve ⇒ 403 `ERR-PS13-SOD_VIOLATION` (P01-enforced); release without checker ⇒ 403 `ERR-PS13-HOLD_RELEASE_SOD`; permanent
destroy ⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-RETENTION_PERMANENT`; unconfirmed anchor ⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-ANCHOR_UNCONFIRMED`. Dependencies: PS01/PS09/PS11
anchor events (outbox), FR-PS13-014 (WORM), `JOB-M11-RETENTION/DISPOSAL`, P01, X.2.

### FR-PS13-010 — E-Signature & Digital Signing (PAdES-LTV + RFC-3161 Timestamping) on DocumentGen Sign-off

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Document Owner, Employee (signer), Records Manager

**User Story:** As an officer, I want to send a document for one or more legally-valid signatures that remain
verifiable for decades, using the platform's existing sign-off machinery.

**Description:** Runs on the **`DocumentGen.generate / sign-off`** service (Platform §Y) over **P01 + W.1**
(document-generation = 23 configured doc-gen stages) and the M11 `signoff_transactions` model; signer-set
resolvability is enforced by **`VAL-M11-SIGNER`** and pending tasks reminded by **`JOB-M11-SIGNOFF-REMIND`**.
PS13 **extends** this with the enterprise-statutory durability layer: **RFC-3161 trusted timestamping** and **PAdES-LTV**
(embedding OCSP/CRL + validation chain) so signatures verify after certificate expiry (R4). Methods restricted to
the type's `allowed_signature_types`; legal basis recorded per signature (R7).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A signing request (P01 sign-off flow) defines ordered/parallel signers, fields, method (from `allowed_signature_types`), optional expiry; signer set resolvable (`VAL-M11-SIGNER`).
2. Signers notified (X.2 `MSG-M11-*` sign-off assigned) and sign in order; sequential blocks later signers.
3. On completion a new signed `document_version` (`version_kind=SIGNED`) is created; the request marks COMPLETED.
4. Each signature records signer, method, legal basis, certificate subject (DSC), signature hash (PAdES).
5. A decline halts the envelope with reason; an expiry cancels pending signatures; `JOB-M11-SIGNOFF-REMIND` nudges pending.
6. Tampering with a signed version is detectable (hash mismatch invalidates).
7. Statutory/WORM documents receive an RFC-3161 timestamp + PAdES-LTV revocation data in `signature_ltv_artifacts`; `ltv_status` reaches `LTV_ENABLED` (R4, `VAL-PS13-LTV`).
8. `DRAWN` rejected for statutory types; DSC or Aadhaar eSign (IT Act §3A) required, basis recorded (R7).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 a type with `requires_signature=true` cannot be final until signed. BR-2 the signed
version is WORM-eligible. BR-3 signatures bind to a specific `version_id`. BR-4 statutory signatures must be
LTV-enabled before COMPLETE (`ERR-PS13-SIGNATURE_LTV_REQUIRED`). BR-5 method must be in `allowed_signature_types`
(`ERR-PS13-SIGNATURE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`).

**Data Model:** `signature_requests` (`signoff_transactions`), `signatures`, `signature_ltv_artifacts`,
`document_versions`, `documents`.

> **RECON note (v3.2):** the letter-generation surface is homed by **`letter_generation_requests`** (per-letter
> queue: merge-field resolution, requested-by/context, signer state, validation error, produced document — links
> to `signature_requests`), **`bulk_letter_jobs`** (batch progress on `JOB-M11-BULKLTR`), and the
> **`merge_field_catalog`** dictionary (`{{token}}` → source) that generation resolves against. See §5.2
> (E32–E34).

**API:** `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/signature-requests`, `POST /api/v1/signature-requests/{id}/sign`,
`:cancel`, `GET /api/v1/signature-requests/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/signatures/{id}/verify`.

**LLD:** Create envelope on the P01 sign-off flow → notify signer(s) (X.2) → on sign, `DocumentGen` applies PAdES
via SigningProvider → obtain RFC-3161 timestamp → embed OCSP/CRL (LTV) → store artifact → on last signer emit
signed version → mark COMPLETED. Failure: decline ⇒ 200 DECLINED; PKI/TSA down ⇒ X.3-mapped 500
`ERR-PS13-SIGNING_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` / retry; tamper ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-SIGNATURE_INVALID`; missing LTV ⇒ 422
`ERR-PS13-SIGNATURE_LTV_REQUIRED`; bad method ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-SIGNATURE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`. Dependencies: **`DocumentGen` sign-off**,
`VAL-M11-SIGNER`, `JOB-M11-SIGNOFF-REMIND`, PKI/eSign provider, RFC-3161 TSA, FR-PS13-004/014, P01/W.1, X.2.

### FR-PS13-011 — Watermarking & Certified True Copies (v1)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Records Manager, DMS Librarian, Security/DLP Officer

**User Story:** As a Records Manager, I want to issue watermarked, certified true copies of statutory records.

**Description:** Generates dynamic watermarks (user, timestamp, purpose) on previews/downloads/prints of
restricted documents and issues **certified true copies** (stamped, optionally LTV-signed renditions via
`DocumentGen`) with a certificate number, WORM-stored for statutory records. Certified copies are **v1**;
interactive redaction is **FR-PS13-021 (Phase 2)** (R19).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Restricted documents render with a dynamic watermark (viewer identity, timestamp, document number).
2. A certified true copy is a new derivative (`version_kind=CERTIFIED_COPY`) stamped "CERTIFIED TRUE COPY" with `certificate_no`, issuer, date, optionally e-signed (LTV via FR-010).
3. The original is never altered; the derivative links via `derived_from_version_id`.
4. Certified copies of statutory documents are WORM-stored (FR-PS13-014).
5. Every issuance recorded in chained `document_audit` (P05).
6. Watermark mandatory (non-removable) for CONFIDENTIAL+ downloads/prints.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 only Records Manager certifies statutory true copies. BR-2 certified copies
inherit/raise classification. BR-3 watermark rendering in a sandboxed renderer (FR-PS13-007).

**Data Model:** `document_versions`, `documents`, `signatures`/`signature_ltv_artifacts`, `document_audit`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:certified-copy`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/render?watermark=1`
(audited proxy).

**LLD:** Render source → apply watermark/stamp to a derivative (`DocumentGen` rendition) → store as new version
(WORM if statutory) → optional LTV sign → chained audit. Failure: render fail ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-RENDITION_FAILED`; wrong
role ⇒ 403. Dependencies: sandboxed renderer, FR-PS13-010/014.

### FR-PS13-012 — Access Audit (View/Download/Print/Share) & Compliance Reporting (P05)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Auditor, Security/DLP Officer, Records Manager

**User Story:** As an Auditor, I want an immutable, tamper-evident record of every view, download, print and
share, queryable through the platform audit service.

**Description:** Records every access event (success or denied) to the **P05** substrate (`document_audit`
access rows + the platform `audit_log`/`security_audit_log` from DB-triggers on mutations), hash-chained
(FR-PS13-020, tracking OPEN-PLAT-03) with actor, role, IP/user-agent, action, version, share context, result, and
`correlation_id`. Provides per-document access history, per-user activity, and compliance reports via **P05
`Audit.query / Audit.export`**. Immutable (P05: no UPDATE/DELETE; sole exception = DPDPA redaction marker).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every VIEW/PREVIEW/DOWNLOAD/PRINT/SHARE and metadata/lifecycle action writes one immutable, chained access row; mutations are captured by P05 DB-triggers.
2. Denied accesses recorded with `result=DENIED` + reason (and `security_audit_log`).
3. A document's access history viewable by Auditor/Records Manager/owner (own) via `Audit.query`.
4. Compliance reports: documents missing retention, overdue disposition, active holds, sensitive-access log, classification mix, audit-chain health, orphaned documents, DPDP requests.
5. The audit log cannot be updated/deleted (DI-3, P05); attempts fail and alert.
6. Audit data exportable (CSV/JSON) for a date/scope range via `Audit.export`, with chain-verification proof.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 print capture only on the platform watermarked print path; out-of-band printing
best-effort (Appendix D). BR-2 audit retention ≥ document retention and ≥ 7 years (P05). BR-3 reading the audit
trail is itself audited (P05).

**Data Model:** `document_audit`, `audit_anchors`, `documents`, `document_shares`, platform `audit_log`/`security_audit_log`.

> **RECON note (v3.2):** policy/letter **acknowledgement campaigns** (`acknowledgement_campaigns` — audience,
> reminder cadence, SLA/escalation, deadline, rollup counts) and the per-employee **non-repudiation acknowledgement
> record** (`document_acknowledgements` — active version, consent-text snapshot, app version/IP, optional
> `consent_records` linkage; DM25) home the sign-off-tracker / policy-ack compliance surface. Per-company
> acknowledgement/sign-off text comes from `policy_letter_settings`. See §5.2 (E30, E35–E36).

`GET /api/v1/reports/compliance/{reportCode}`, `POST /api/v1/audit:export` (via `Audit.export`).

**LLD:** Every gateway access emits a chained access event to the durable P05 sink → reports aggregate over
`document_audit` + metadata via `Audit.query`. Failure: sink down ⇒ buffer + retry, never drop; tamper attempt ⇒
403 + alert; chain break ⇒ `ERR-PS13-AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN`. Dependencies: **P05**, FR-PS13-013/020.

### FR-PS13-013 — Secure Sharing & Expiring Links (Anti-Brute-Force)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Document Owner, DMS Librarian, Security/DLP Officer

**User Story:** As a document owner, I want to share a document with an internal user or via a time-limited,
optionally password-protected external link that resists guessing.

**Description:** Creates internal shares or external tokenised links with scoped rights, mandatory expiry for
external links, optional argon2id password and access-count cap, optional watermark, and full P05 audit.
**Anti-brute-force (R16):** failed password attempts increment `failed_attempt_count`; past threshold,
`status=LOCKED`/`locked_until`, alert Security (X.2). All served bytes go through the audited proxy and write
`document_audit` (R2).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Internal share grants scoped rights to a named user without a public URL.
2. External link requires `expires_at`, stores only a hashed token.
3. Optional password (argon2id) and `max_access_count` enforced.
4. Accessing via a share writes chained `document_audit` with `share_id` and applies watermark if required.
5. Revoking a share immediately invalidates it.
6. DLP `BLOCK_SHARE` findings prevent external sharing of flagged documents.
7. After N (default 5) failed password attempts the link locks (`ERR-PS13-SHARE_LOCKED`), sets `locked_until`, alerts Security (R16).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 CONFIDENTIAL+ external links require Security/DLP approval + watermark. BR-2 external
links cannot grant PRINT/UPDATE. BR-3 expired/revoked/locked links return 404 to anonymous callers (no leak).

**Data Model:** `document_shares`, `documents`, `dlp_findings`, `document_audit`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/shares`, `GET /api/v1/shared/{token}` (rate-limited),
`POST /api/v1/shares/{id}:revoke`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/shares`.

**LLD:** Validate rights + DLP gate → generate opaque token, store `token_hash` → on access verify
hash/password/expiry/count/lockout → serve watermarked render via audited proxy → chained P05 audit. Failure:
expired/revoked ⇒ 404; over count ⇒ 403 `ERR-PS13-SHARE_LIMIT_REACHED`; DLP block ⇒ 403 `ERR-PS13-SHARE_BLOCKED_DLP`; locked ⇒ 429
`ERR-PS13-SHARE_LOCKED`. Dependencies: FR-PS13-006/011/012/016, X.2, RateLimiter.

### FR-PS13-014 — Immutable WORM Storage for Statutory Documents (enterprise EXTENSION)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Records Manager, Security/DLP Officer, System

**User Story:** As a Records Manager, I want statutory documents stored Write-Once-Read-Many with object-lock
retention, so they cannot be altered or deleted before lawful expiry, even by administrators.

**Description:** **This FR is entirely enterprise-specific — PrimeSoft M11 has no WORM.** Stores statutory documents in
WORM-locked object storage with `worm_retain_until`. WORM documents reject overwrite/supersede/delete/disposition
before the horizon; even Sys Admin/break-glass cannot mutate content. Legal holds extend immutability
indefinitely. The WORM guarantee is **proven on the actual CGG storage backend as a gating launch spike**
(§15.3).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `is_worm=true` documents stored in `WORM_LOCKED` class with `worm_retain_until` set.
2. Any overwrite/version-mutate/delete/dispose before `worm_retain_until` is rejected.
3. WORM defaults applied automatically for statutory types (`is_worm_default=true`).
4. A legal hold on a WORM document blocks disposition even after `worm_retain_until`.
5. WORM status + retain-until visible/auditable (P05); retain-until can only extend (`VAL-PS13-WORM`).
6. After retain-until and no hold, disposition follows the certified workflow (FR-PS13-009).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 WORM immutability enforced at the storage layer (object-lock). BR-2 `worm_retain_until`
extend-only. BR-3 certified true copies of statutory records WORM by default.

**Data Model:** `documents`, `storage_objects`, `document_versions`, `disposition_records`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:declare-worm`, `:extend-retention`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/worm-status`.

**LLD:** Declare ⇒ set object-lock + class + retain-until → all mutation paths check WORM guard. Failure: mutation
⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-WORM_IMMUTABLE`; shorten retain ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-RETENTION_SHORTEN_FORBIDDEN`. Dependencies: object-lock-capable
storage (proven on CGG backend), FR-PS13-004/009.

### FR-PS13-015 — Domain-Scoped Deduplication, Integrity & Sandboxed Thumbnail/Preview

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** System, DMS Librarian

**User Story:** As a system, I want to deduplicate identical content within a single security domain, verify
integrity by checksum, and generate previews in sandboxes.

**Description:** Computes SHA-256 over every blob and an **HMAC dedup index key** scoped to the security domain;
identical content within the same `security_domain` + `key_scope` reuses a single `storage_objects` row
(reference-counted); cross-domain identical content stored separately (R1). Periodic (`JOB-PS13-INTEGRITY`) and
on-read integrity checks detect bit-rot/tampering. A sandboxed renderer (R17) produces thumbnails/previews. Dedup
never surfaced (R9).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Uploading content identical to an existing blob **in the same domain** reuses it (`ref_count++`); cross-domain identical content is NOT deduplicated.
2. A blob is physically deleted only when `ref_count`=0 and no WORM/hold; crypto-shred only when `dek_shared=false`.
3. Stored `content_hash` verified on download and periodically (`JOB-PS13-INTEGRITY`); mismatch flags `integrity_verified=false`, quarantines the version.
4. Thumbnails/multi-page previews generated in sandboxed workers, served per P02.
5. Preview never exposes content to unauthorised principals (P02 + clearance checked).
6. Integrity failures alert and block serving the affected version.
7. No user-visible signal (timing, message, ref_count) reveals dedup (R9).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 dedup on `dedup_index_key` within a domain; metadata/ACLs per-document. BR-2 WORM/held/
shared blobs never GC'd/crypto-shredded. BR-3 preview is a sandbox derivative; watermark for restricted docs.

**Data Model:** `storage_objects`, `document_versions`, `scan_results`, `documents`.

**API:** `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/thumbnail`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/preview?page=`,
`POST /api/v1/admin/integrity:scan`.

**LLD:** On store hash + HMAC domain key → domain-scoped dedup → reuse (set `dek_shared`) or create blob; on read
verify hash; render in sandbox with P02 + watermark. Failure: integrity mismatch ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-INTEGRITY_FAILED` +
quarantine; render over-limit ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-RENDER_RESOURCE_LIMIT`. Dependencies: object storage, sandboxed renderer,
FR-PS13-007/011.

### FR-PS13-016 — DLP, Content Lifecycle, Provider-Abstracted Engines & Corrected Attach/Fetch Contract

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Security/DLP Officer, DMS Librarian, Uploader (module service)

**User Story:** As a Security Officer and integrating developer, I want sensitive content detected (DLP), all
engines provider-abstracted, and a stable attach/fetch contract whose fetch makes "view" and "download"
structurally different.

**Description:** Runs DLP content inspection (`DlpProvider`) producing `dlp_findings`; manages content lifecycle;
exposes the **provider-abstracted** storage/AV/OCR/DLP/PKI layer (R13); and defines the **canonical, day-one-frozen
attach/fetch contract** — the document service every enterprise module consumes. The fetch contract (R2): callers MUST
specify `intent=VIEW|DOWNLOAD` (`VAL-PS13-FETCH-INTENT`) and receive **structurally different** responses — VIEW
returns a short-TTL, one-time, session/user(+IP)-bound **streamed watermarked render URL through the audited
proxy** (no raw blob); DOWNLOAD returns a file only with the DOWNLOAD right. CONFIDENTIAL+ never returns a raw
forwardable blob URL, and every served byte writes `document_audit` (P05).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. DLP scans extracted text on ingest and new versions → `dlp_findings` (rule, severity, count, suggested action).
2. HIGH/CRITICAL PII findings auto-raise classification to ≥ CONFIDENTIAL (and set `security_domain`) and tag the document.
3. The storage layer is provider-agnostic: switching backend/tier never changes `document_id` or the API; AV/OCR/DLP/PKI likewise behind interfaces (R13).
4. Content lifecycle transitions follow §12.1 with chained P05 audit at every transition.
5. `:attach` lets any PS01–PS12 module bind a document, returning a stable `documentId`/`linkId`; accepts `Idempotency-Key`.
6. `:fetch` requires `intent`; VIEW returns a one-time short-TTL session-bound watermarked render URL via the audited proxy; DOWNLOAD returns a file ONLY with the DOWNLOAD right; neither returns a raw forwardable blob URL for CONFIDENTIAL+; every served byte audited (R2).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 DLP `BLOCK_SHARE` prevents external sharing until remediated. BR-2 storage tiering never
weakens encryption/WORM. BR-3 modules never receive raw storage keys — only `document_id` + short-lived,
session-bound, single-use signed render/download URLs through the audited proxy (R2). BR-4 a VIEW grant never
yields a downloadable file (R2).

**Data Model:** `dlp_findings`, `documents`, `storage_objects`, `document_links`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/documents:attach`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}:fetch?intent=VIEW|DOWNLOAD`,
`GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/dlp`, `POST /api/v1/dlp-findings/{id}:resolve`.

**LLD:** Extract text → DLP rules → findings + auto-classify/tag → lifecycle transitions guarded by the state
machine → attach validates + links → fetch resolves intent: VIEW issues one-time session-bound render token
through the audited proxy; DOWNLOAD checks DOWNLOAD right (P02) then streams audited file. Failure: attach
incomplete ⇒ 422; missing intent ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-FETCH_INTENT_REQUIRED`; download without right ⇒ 403; fetch disposed ⇒
404 `ERR-PS13-DOCUMENT_DISPOSED`; DLP engine down ⇒ defer scan, store, block serving until scanned. Dependencies:
DLP/storage/AV/OCR/PKI providers, FR-PS13-002/006/013, all PS01–PS12 modules (consumers), **P05**.

### FR-PS13-017 — Principal Security-Clearance Management (GAP enterprise-specific, R3)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Security/DLP Officer (maker), Records Manager (checker), Auditor

**User Story:** As a Security Officer, I want to grant, time-box, suspend and revoke a principal's document-domain
clearance through a maker-checker workflow, so **P02** has a real, audited `clearance_level` to gate
CONFIDENTIAL+ documents.

**Description:** Owns the enterprise `security_clearances` entity and a **P01 maker-checker** workflow to assign a
`clearance_level` (PUBLIC…TOP_SECRET) to a USER or RBAC ROLE, optionally org-scoped, with validity dates and
periodic recertification (`JOB-PS13-CLEARANCE-RECERT`). Grants proposed by Security (maker), approved by Records
Manager (checker, maker≠checker via P01); every change writes chained audit (P05). **P02** reads
`effective_clearance_level` live; default INTERNAL when none.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A grant specifies principal (USER/ROLE), `clearance_level`, optional org scope, justification, validity window.
2. Grants require a maker (Security) and a distinct checker (Records Manager) via P01; self-grant rejected (`ERR-PS13-SOD_VIOLATION`).
3. ACTIVE clearance resolved live by P02; SUSPENDED/EXPIRED/REVOKED immediately removes CONFIDENTIAL+ access.
4. A principal with no clearance defaults INTERNAL.
5. Clearances support `valid_until` + periodic recert; lapses auto-expire to INTERNAL (`JOB-PS13-CLEARANCE-RECERT`).
6. Every change writes chained `document_audit (CLEARANCE_CHANGE)` + `security_audit_log`.
7. TOP_SECRET requires two approvers and alerts.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 maker≠checker (DI-16, P01). BR-2 ROLE clearance applies to all users holding that RBAC
role within scope; USER overrides upward only. BR-3 clearance only satisfies the classification dimension — an
ALLOW ACL/relationship is still required (P02 deny-by-default). BR-4 recert overdue ⇒ auto-SUSPENDED + notify.

**Data Model:** `security_clearances`, `documents`, `document_audit`, `users`/`roles`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/clearances:propose`, `:approve`, `:suspend`/`:revoke`,
`GET /api/v1/clearances?principal=&limit=&cursor=`.

**LLD:** Propose → checker approve via P01 (maker≠checker) → ACTIVE → P02 resolves effective level per principal
(TTL + invalidation on change); `JOB-PS13-CLEARANCE-RECERT` expires/suspends on lapse. Failure: self-approve ⇒
403 `ERR-PS13-SOD_VIOLATION`; unknown principal ⇒ 404; insufficient approvers (TOP_SECRET) ⇒ 422. Dependencies:
FR-PS13-006 (P02 consumer), **P01**, X.2.

### FR-PS13-018 — DPDP Data-Subject Requests & Erasure Precedence Lattice (GAP enterprise-specific, R8)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Data Protection Officer (DPO), Records Manager, Auditor

**User Story:** As a DPO, I want to receive and adjudicate DPDP data-subject requests against a clear precedence
lattice, so we honour privacy rights without breaching statutory retention, legal holds, or WORM.

**Description:** Owns `data_subject_requests` (linked to platform `consent_records`) and implements the
**precedence lattice (DI-15)**: statutory retention / active legal hold / WORM-before-retain-until **override**
erasure (`EXEMPT_RETAINED` + `legal_basis_exemption`); only where none applies is erasure fulfilled — executed on
the **P05 right-to-erasure redaction-marker path + `JOB-M11-DISPOSAL`**, by **domain-local crypto-shred**
(`dek_shared=false`) or physical purge of the unshared blob. ACCESS/PORTABILITY assemble the subject's permitted
documents; RECTIFICATION routes corrections to the owning module.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A request records subject, type, received timestamp (statutory clock), optional `consent_ref_id`.
2. ERASURE evaluates each in-scope document against the lattice; statutory/hold/WORM documents exempted (`EXEMPT_RETAINED`) with recorded basis.
3. Non-exempt documents erased via the P05 redaction-marker path + `JOB-M11-DISPOSAL` (crypto-shred when `dek_shared=false`, else physical purge); shared blobs never shredded (DI-6).
4. ACCESS/PORTABILITY assemble only entitled documents, watermarked, via the audited fetch path.
5. Every decision/erasure writes chained `document_audit (ERASURE)`; updates `documents.dpdp_erasure_state`; audit PII overwritten with the P05 redaction marker (Vision §2.7).
6. The lifecycle (RECEIVED→UNDER_REVIEW→EXEMPTED/PARTIALLY_FULFILLED/FULFILLED/REJECTED) is auditable/reportable.
7. The DPO who exempts ≠ the custodian who executes the purge (SoD, P01).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 statutory/hold/WORM always overrides erasure (DI-15). BR-2 crypto-shred only on
`dek_shared=false`. BR-3 tombstone + certificate retained. BR-4 ACCESS excludes sealed records the subject is
not entitled to see. **BR-5 statutory data has legally mandated retention — erasure applies to non-statutory data
only (Vision §2.7); statutory floors are never breached.**

**Data Model:** `data_subject_requests`, `documents`, `storage_objects`, `disposition_records`, `document_audit`,
`consent_records`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/dsr`, `:adjudicate`, `:execute` (dual-control), `GET /api/v1/dsr/{id}`.

**LLD:** Register → enumerate subject documents → evaluate lattice per document → adjudicate (DPO) → execute
(P01 dual-control): crypto-shred/purge non-exempt unshared blobs via `JOB-M11-DISPOSAL` + P05 redaction marker,
mark exempt with basis → chained audit. Failure: erasure of held/WORM ⇒ `EXEMPT_RETAINED`; crypto-shred of shared
blob ⇒ blocked (metadata-only removal); self-execute ⇒ 403 `ERR-PS13-SOD_VIOLATION`. Dependencies: FR-PS13-009/014/005,
**P05 redaction path**, **`JOB-M11-DISPOSAL`**, `consent_records`, PS01 (subject).

### FR-PS13-019 — Orphaned-Document Lifecycle (Orphan Reaper) (GAP enterprise-specific, R15)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** DMS Librarian, Records Manager, System

**User Story:** As a Records Manager, I want documents that lose all module links to enter a defined orphan
lifecycle with a default retention and a review queue.

**Description:** When `documents.link_count` reaches 0 and no retention/hold/WORM governs it, the document
transitions to `ORPHANED`, receives a default orphan retention class, and enters a review queue. A periodic
**`JOB-PS13-ORPHAN`** (X.1) surfaces orphans for Librarian review; a Records Manager may re-home, retain, or route
to disposition (never auto-destroy).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A document whose `link_count` drops to 0 and that is not WORM/held transitions to `ORPHANED` + default orphan retention class.
2. Orphans appear in a review queue with last-known links, owner, age.
3. A Librarian/Records Manager may re-link, retain with a new class, or propose disposition (P01 maker-checker).
4. Orphans are never auto-destroyed; disposition follows FR-PS13-009.
5. WORM/held documents never become orphans regardless of `link_count`.
6. Every transition writes chained audit (P05); an "Orphaned documents" report lists current orphans.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 ORPHANED reversible by re-linking (→ ACTIVE). BR-2 default orphan retention configurable
(e.g., 1 year REVIEW), never below statutory floor. BR-3 orphan reaping is a review surface, not an auto-destroyer.

**Data Model:** `documents`, `document_links`, `retention_assignments`, `document_audit`.

**API:** `GET /api/v1/admin/orphans`, `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:rehome`, `POST /api/v1/admin/orphans:scan`.

**LLD:** On detach decrement `link_count` → if 0 and not WORM/held → set ORPHANED + default class → enqueue
review; `JOB-PS13-ORPHAN` reconciles `link_count` vs links. Failure: re-home to disposed entity ⇒ 409; dispose
orphan under hold ⇒ 409 `ERR-PS13-LEGAL_HOLD_ACTIVE`. Dependencies: FR-PS13-003/009, X.1.

### FR-PS13-020 — Audit Hash-Chain Integrity & External Anchoring (GAP enterprise-specific, R5; tracks OPEN-PLAT-03)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** Auditor, Security/DLP Officer, System

**User Story:** As an Auditor, I want the access-audit trail cryptographically tamper-evident and periodically
anchored outside the database.

**Description:** Maintains the `document_audit` **hash chain** (`row_hash` = SHA-256 over canonical payload ‖
prior `row_hash`) on the P05 substrate and a periodic **anchoring job** (`JOB-PS13-ANCHOR`) that computes a Merkle
root over each window and writes it to `audit_anchors`, anchored to WORM/external notary/RFC-3161 TSA. A
**verification job** (`JOB-PS13-CHAINVERIFY`) recomputes and compares; any mismatch raises `ERR-PS13-AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN`
and alerts. **This implements the platform OPEN-PLAT-03 proposal (hash-chaining of audit partitions, chain head
to WORM) for the enterprise-statutory tier rather than inventing a parallel mechanism.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every `document_audit` insert computes `row_hash` chained to `prev_hash`; append-only (P05).
2. `JOB-PS13-ANCHOR` summarises each contiguous window into an `audit_anchors` digest anchored to WORM/notary/TSA.
3. `JOB-PS13-CHAINVERIFY` recomputes a range and compares; a break sets `verification_status=BROKEN` + `ERR-PS13-AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN` + alert.
4. Auditors can request on-demand verification for a date/scope range and receive pass/fail + offending `seq_no`.
5. Anchors are immutable (WORM/notary receipts retained).
6. e-discovery exports (FR-PS13-012) include anchor references + verification proof.

**Business Rules:** BR-1 chain genesis uses a fixed `prev_hash`; ordering by `seq_no`. BR-2 anchoring cadence
configurable. BR-3 a detected break never auto-repairs — investigated as a security incident.

**Data Model:** `document_audit`, `audit_anchors`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/audit:verify?from=&to=`, `GET /api/v1/audit/anchors`, `POST /api/v1/admin/audit:anchor`.

**LLD:** Insert computes `row_hash` from prior row → `JOB-PS13-ANCHOR` builds Merkle root per window → writes
`audit_anchors` to WORM/notary/TSA → `JOB-PS13-CHAINVERIFY` recomputes + compares. Failure: chain break ⇒
`ERR-PS13-AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN` (500) + incident alert; anchor target down ⇒ retry/buffer. Dependencies: **P05**,
FR-PS13-014 (WORM anchor sink), RFC-3161 TSA, X.1. **Open dependency: confirm OPEN-PLAT-03 before build (Platform §Z).**

### FR-PS13-021 — Interactive Redaction Studio (Phase 2 / Fast-Follow) (R19)

- **Module:** PS13-DMS · **Primary Role(s):** DMS Librarian, Security/DLP Officer, Records Manager

**Phasing note:** Fast-follow (Phase 2), deferred from the launch core (R19). Until it ships, disclosure/RTI needs
are served by certified true copies (FR-PS13-011) + manual interim redaction. Specified in full so the contract is
stable.

**User Story:** As a Librarian, I want to produce a redacted derivative where selected regions are irreversibly
removed and verified-removed.

**Description:** Produces a **redacted derivative version** (`version_kind=REDACTED`) where selected regions are
burned out of a rasterised render (`DocumentGen` rendition) and re-OCR'd to **verify the redacted text is
unrecoverable**. The original is never altered; the derivative inherits/raises classification. Runs in the
sandboxed renderer (FR-PS13-007).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Redaction produces a new `REDACTED` derivative with selected regions burned out; redacted text not recoverable.
2. The derivative is re-OCR'd and diffed to confirm removal; incomplete ⇒ `ERR-PS13-REDACTION_INCOMPLETE`.
3. The original is never altered; derivative links via `derived_from_version_id`.
4. Derivatives inherit/raise classification.
5. Every redaction recorded in chained `document_audit` (P05).
6. Redaction of a WORM/held source allowed (read-only source; derivative is a new object).

**Business Rules:** BR-1 redaction irreversible by construction (burned raster). BR-2 re-OCR verification
mandatory. BR-3 runs in the sandboxed renderer (R17).

**Data Model:** `document_versions`, `documents`, `document_audit`.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}:redact`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/redactions`.

**LLD:** Rasterise → burn regions → re-OCR derivative → diff against redacted regions → store derivative (WORM if
statutory) → chained audit. Failure: recoverable redaction ⇒ 422 `ERR-PS13-REDACTION_INCOMPLETE`; render fail ⇒ 422
`ERR-PS13-RENDITION_FAILED`. Dependencies: sandboxed renderer, OCR, FR-PS13-011/014.

### 7.2 Cross-cutting UI rules (canonical UI-state standard, Foundation §3)

- **Five canonical states on every screen:** empty, loading (skeleton, no layout shift), **error** (inline from an
  `ERR-*` id + retry, never a raw stack), **no-permission** (gating menu hidden; deep-linked forbidden shows
  `ERR-FORBIDDEN`, not a 404 leak), **partial-data** (render what is authorised, mask the rest per RBAC §3.9 — never
  fail the whole screen). **No skeleton-only UI** — real fields, data, API calls, states.
- WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard-navigable tree/grid; focus-visible; screen-reader labels; responsive 375/768/1280;
  touch ≥ 44×44.
- Classification badge + status icons (WORM/held/sealed/orphaned) on every document surface.
- **Masked fields** per RBAC §3.9 / P02 (masked-own-view: owner sees Tier-1 IDs masked on screen, may export full
  record unmasked); the access explainer names the failing dimension (RBAC / clearance / ACL / need-to-know).
- Dynamic watermark always visible on restricted previews/downloads/prints; VIEW renders are streamed (no file).
- `E·AR` fields (e.g. linked Aadhaar/PAN/bank metadata) render read-only with a "Request change" control routing
  to the P01 sensitive-changes flow — never a direct write.
- Destructive/lifecycle actions (dispose, release hold, downgrade, clearance revoke, DSR execute) require
  confirmation + reason (`VAL-COMMENT`) and show the SoD second-approver step (P01).
- All lists **cursor-paginated** (limit 25/100) with facets/filters; `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates; user-locale rendering.

---

## 10. API & Integration

### 10.1 Conventions (platform-adopted, Foundation §1)

- Base path `/api/v1`; JSON over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+); OIDC/JWT bearer auth; **P02** RBAC + org scope + clearance.
- **Cursor pagination only** (`?limit=` default 25, max 100, `cursor=`; response `next_cursor`). Offset paging not used.
- Binaries only via short-lived, single-use, session/user-bound signed render/download URLs through the **audited
  proxy** (never a raw blob URL).
- **`Idempotency-Key`** header on all unsafe POSTs that create a transaction (24h replay returns the original).
- **`X-Correlation-Id`** carried/assigned per request, echoed in the response header, written to every P05 audit line.
- Action-style endpoints use the `:verb` suffix (`:attach`, `:checkin`, `:fetch`). `:fetch` REQUIRES
  `intent=VIEW|DOWNLOAD` (`VAL-PS13-FETCH-INTENT`, R2).
- Endpoints never re-implement permission logic — they call `Authorization.check` (P02).

### 10.2 Canonical error envelope (Foundation §1)

```json
{ "error": { "code": "ERR-PS13-WORM_IMMUTABLE", "message": "Document is under WORM lock until 2046-04-01.", "field": "documentId", "details": {} } }
```

> The correlation id is returned in the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header**, **not** a body `requestId` field
> (Reconciliation §C override of the v2 envelope).

### 10.3 Error-code catalog

**Standard platform codes (Foundation §1):** `VALIDATION_FAILED(422)`, `UNAUTHENTICATED(401)`, `FORBIDDEN(403)`,
`NOT_FOUND(404)`, `CONFLICT(409)`, `PRECONDITION_FAILED(412)`, `RATE_LIMITED(429)`, `INTERNAL(500)`. No 503 —
upstream-engine (KMS/PKI/TSA/storage) failures map via X.3 to 500 / `ERR-LOADFAIL`.

**Module-specific `ERR-PS13-*` codes (in addition).** Each module code is namespaced `ERR-PS13-<NAME>` and mapped
onto exactly one of the 8 standard HTTP codes above; the **Meaning** column is the message id rendered in the
envelope `message`. No module code carries a non-standard HTTP status (no 400/503 — upstream failures collapse to
`INTERNAL 500` via X.3 retry).

| `ERR-PS13-*` code | HTTP | Message id (Meaning) |
|------|------|---------|

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements (platform NFR baseline, Vision §2.9 / BRD §7)

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Performance | **p95 < 500 ms @ 300 concurrent** for metadata ops; read-heavy p95 < 300 ms cached / < 1000 ms uncached; writes p95 < 1500 ms; upload 250 MB resumable; preview first-page < 2 s; search p95 < 800 ms; web LCP < 2.5 s (4G) |
| Scalability | Horizontal API scaling; object storage to PB scale; domain-scoped dedup keeps growth sub-linear |
| Availability | **99.5%/month uptime**; degrade gracefully (metadata search if index down; resumable upload on storage blips). KMS named top-tier risk (R6): no single CMK loss may darken the archive — multi-region/HSM escrow + tested recovery runbook |
| Durability | Object storage ≥ 11 nines with cross-zone replication; **RTO < 4 h, RPO < 1 h**; CMK escrow restore tested quarterly |
| Security | Envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM) + KMS; TLS 1.2+; OWASP ASVS L2; **P02** deny-by-default + PII ceiling + field mask on serialization; clearance gate; hash-chained + anchored audit (OPEN-PLAT-03); encrypted access-scoped search index excluding SECRET+ full text; anti-brute-force; sandboxed render workers; no raw storage keys to clients; VIEW/DOWNLOAD structurally separated |
| Privacy | DPDP 2023 alignment; DLP PII detection + minimisation; **P05 right-to-erasure redaction-marker path**; `consent_records`; data-subject-request lifecycle + erasure precedence lattice; no dedup existence oracle |
| Data Residency | All data and all replicas (cross-zone, escrow, index, audit anchors) reside **in-country** (DPDP localisation); no provider/COTS adapter may move PII out of the sovereign boundary (R21) |
| Compliance | Statutory retention (M11 classes, never below floor); WORM immutability (proven on CGG backend); certified destruction; immutable, anchored P05 audit (≥ 7 yr); e-discovery export with chain proof; IT Act §3A signatures (LTV-durable) |
| Audit completeness | 100% mutation capture (P05 DB-trigger, zero gaps) + enterprise access-audit |
| Integrity | SHA-256 checksums; periodic integrity scans (`JOB-PS13-INTEGRITY`); tamper detection blocks serving; audit hash-chain verification |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA across all screens |
| Observability | Metrics on ingest/scan/OCR latency, quarantine rate, integrity failures, disposition backlog, audit-chain health, key-DR posture, hold-notice ack SLA, DSR SLA, dead-letter depth (per Platform §0.5); `JOB-FAIL`→`MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL` |
| Maintainability | Provider-abstracted storage + AV + OCR + DLP + PKI; versioned `document_types` (W.2) schemas; API `/v1` stability; thin orchestration core consuming platform engines |
| Deletions | Soft delete only — no hard delete (platform rule) |

## 13. Notifications (X.2 / W.3; reuse `MSG-M11-*`, author `MSG-PS13-*`)

Channels per BRD §9.1 (IN_APP + EMAIL fire in parallel for approvals); EMAIL for approval-workflow and statutory
notices is **mandatory / non-suppressible** (Platform §X.2, BRD §9.9). Templates referenced by `MSG-*` id;
recipient/channel/timing resolved by **W.3**; delivered by **X.2** (retry ×5 + dead-letter; every dispatch audited).

## 14. Reporting & Analytics (PS14 / PrimeSoft M16 consumes read-only)

| Report | Description | Audience |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Documents without retention | Docs missing a retention class | Records Manager |
| Overdue disposition | DISPOSITION_DUE past due, not held | Records Manager |
| Legal-hold inventory | Active holds + held + auto-added counts | LH Admin/Approver, Auditor |
| Hold-notice acknowledgement | Sent/acknowledged/overdue per matter | LH Approver |
| Sensitive-access log | Who accessed CONFIDENTIAL+ in a period (P05) | Auditor, Security |
| Classification distribution | Counts by classification/type/org unit | Security, PS14 |
| Quarantine/infection rate | AV blocks over time, repeat offenders | Security |
| Integrity health | Verified vs failed checksum scans | Security, Records Manager |
| Audit chain health | Last anchor, last verification, any break (OPEN-PLAT-03) | Auditor, Security |
| Storage & dedup efficiency | Logical vs physical bytes, tier mix, domain-scoped dedup ratio | Sys Admin |
| Signing throughput | Pending/completed/declined envelopes, LTV coverage, cycle time | Records Manager |
| DLP findings | Open/remediated PII findings by rule/severity | Security/DLP |
| Clearance register | Active clearances by level/scope, recert-due | Security, Auditor |
| DPDP request log | DSRs by type/status/SLA, exemptions vs fulfilments | DPO, Auditor |
| Orphaned documents | Current orphans, age, last links | Records Manager, Librarian |
| Key-DR posture | Escrow/replication status, last DR rehearsal | Sys Admin, Security |

All reports are permission-scoped (P02), cursor-paginated, and exportable (CSV/JSON); PS14 consumes aggregates
read-only via `analytics.*`.

## 15. Migration & Launch (on P06 ETL+V)

### 15.0 Day-one contract freeze (R14)

Before any internals are built, **freeze and publish the stubbed attach/fetch contract** (`:attach`,
`:fetch?intent=VIEW|DOWNLOAD`, error catalog §10.3, `documentId`/`securityDomain` semantics, the enterprise
`clearance_level`/`security_clearances` model read by P02) as a **mock service** (Appendix F). All other PS01–PS12
module teams develop against this mock while PS13's internals are built behind it, removing PS13 from the program
critical path. The contract version is pinned (`/api/v1`) and changes only via amendment.

### 15.1 Data migration (gated programme on P06, R18)

- Run on **P06 ETL+V** (Extract → Validate → Transform → Load → Verify), scripted idempotently, with **three
  mandatory staging dry runs**, **waves**, a **`migration_runs`** ledger, and a permanent **`<enterprise>_source_id`**
  traceability/dedup column (follows the `darwinbox_source_id` pattern against the actual legacy register —
  `GAP (enterprise-specific)` source system).
- Inventory legacy stores (file shares, scanned archives, module-local blobs); classify by type, sensitivity, and
  **security domain**.
- Ingest each file through the standard pipeline (scan + hash + domain-scoped dedup + sandboxed OCR), encrypting
  on ingest; assign `document_type` (M11 `letter_template` where applicable), classification, **M11 retention
  class**, WORM for statutory records, and clearance-bearing ACLs.
- Backfill `document_links` from each module's attachment references; verify FK integrity (DI-14); recompute
  `link_count` (orphan detection).
- **Reconciliation tolerances + dead-letter:** every batch reports matched/unmatched counts and checksum parity
  against a target SLA; failures route to a **dead-letter queue** (P06), never silent drop; a migration audit
  report (P05) is produced per batch.

### 15.2 Cutover & launch

- Stand up storage buckets (HOT/WARM/COLD/WORM), KMS keys (+ escrow/replication via P04), AV/OCR/DLP/PKI/TSA
  integrations (X.3), encrypted search index; smoke-test the pipeline.
- Dual-run: modules attach to PS13 (real) while legacy remains read-only; verify fetch(VIEW/DOWNLOAD)/preview/
  search parity and P05 audit chaining.
- Freeze legacy writes; flip modules to the PS13 attach contract; decommission legacy after reconciliation sign-off
  (legacy kept read-only ≥ 4 weeks post-go-live, per P06).

### 15.3 Launch readiness checklist

- [ ] Encryption (KMS) + TLS verified; no plaintext at rest.
- [ ] **Key-DR proven:** CMK escrow/replication live; recovery runbook rehearsed end-to-end (R6).
- [ ] **WORM object-lock verified on the ACTUAL CGG storage backend** (gating spike — M11 has no WORM, this is net-new).
- [ ] AV (archive limits), sandboxed OCR/preview/render, DLP, PKI, **RFC-3161 TSA + PAdES-LTV** integrations green.
- [ ] Retention (M11 classes) / hold / disposition tested on **P01** with maker-checker, **hold-release dual control**, and **event-driven anchor** recompute; `JOB-M11-RETENTION/DISPOSAL` wired.
- [ ] **Audit hash-chain + anchoring** verified against **OPEN-PLAT-03** (insert→anchor→verify; tamper detected); confirm OPEN-PLAT-03 status before build.
- [ ] **Clearance model** seeded; **P02** reads `effective_clearance_level`; default-INTERNAL verified.
- [ ] **Fetch contract** VIEW vs DOWNLOAD structurally separated; no raw blob URL for CONFIDENTIAL+; every byte audited (P05).
- [ ] **Anti-brute-force** lockouts active on `/shared/{token}` and break-glass.
- [ ] **DPDP DSR** lattice tested (exempt held/WORM; crypto-shred unshared via **P05 redaction + JOB-M11-DISPOSAL**).
- [ ] **Search index** encrypted + access-scoped; SECRET/TOP_SECRET excluded from full text.
- [ ] **DB-restore-vs-immutable-store/KMS consistency runbook** validated (§15.4).
- [ ] **Data residency** confirmed: all replicas/escrow/index/anchors in-country (R21).
- [ ] Attach/fetch contract validated against PS01, PS02, PS09, PS11; `tenant_id`/`entity_id` scoping enforced.
- [ ] Compliance reports populated; PS14 read-only access confirmed; `MSG-M11-*`/`MSG-PS13-*` registered (X.2).
- [ ] Migration reconciliation: 0 unmatched links, 0 failed checksums (or dead-lettered + logged) on P06.

### 15.4 DB-restore vs immutable-store/KMS consistency runbook (R19)

A point-in-time PostgreSQL restore can desynchronise metadata from the immutable object store and KMS. The
runbook: (1) after restore, run a **consistency reconciler** cross-checking `documents`/`document_versions`
against `storage_objects`, disposition tombstones, and KMS key state; (2) any **disposed** document whose
metadata reappears is re-tombstoned; (3) any metadata referencing a missing blob is flagged for integrity review;
(4) the audit chain is re-verified against `audit_anchors` (OPEN-PLAT-03) to detect restore-window gaps. No
restored state is trusted until the reconciler passes.

### 16.2 Dependency / build order

0. **Day-one (R14):** freeze + publish the stubbed attach/fetch contract, error catalog, `documents` entity, and
   `clearance_level`/`security_clearances` model as a mock (Appendix F) — unblocks all PS01–PS12 modules.
1. **Foundation:** confirm M11 vault reuse + storage abstraction + KMS encryption + key-DR (FR-005) and core
   entities (documents, versions, storage_objects with security_domain).
2. **Ingestion safety:** validation (`VAL-FILE`) + malware scan + render sandboxing (FR-007), then upload (FR-001).
3. **Organisation:** types/taxonomy/signature-checkout policy (FR-002, extends `letter_templates`), folders +
   attach contract (FR-003).
4. **Content ops:** versioning (FR-004), domain-scoped dedup/integrity/sandboxed preview (FR-015), secured
   OCR/search (FR-008).
5. **Governance core:** clearance (FR-017, P01/P02), access control (FR-006, P02), audit + hash-chain + anchoring
   (FR-012/020, P05/OPEN-PLAT-03), retention/hold/event-disposition (FR-009, `JOB-M11-*`/P01), WORM (FR-014).
6. **Privacy & hygiene:** DPDP DSR lattice (FR-018, P05 redaction + `JOB-M11-DISPOSAL`), orphan reaper (FR-019).
7. **Advanced:** e-signature LTV (FR-010, `DocumentGen` sign-off), watermark/certified copies (FR-011), sharing
   (FR-013), DLP/lifecycle/providers/fetch (FR-016). **Phase 2 fast-follow:** interactive redaction (FR-021).

### 16.3 Parallel-agent plan

## 18. Appendices

### Appendix A — Default retention schedule (illustrative — realised as M11 retention classes)

| Document type | Trigger | Period | Action |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Service Register page | ON_CREATE | Permanent | REVIEW (never auto-destroy) |
| Pension Payment Order (PPO) | ON_EMPLOYEE_RETIRE | Permanent | REVIEW |
| Charge-sheet / inquiry record | ON_CASE_CLOSE | 30 years | REVIEW |
| Payslip / Form-16 | FISCAL_YEAR_END | 8 years | DESTROY |
| Training certificate | ON_CREATE | 10 years | REVIEW |
| ID proof (change request) | ON_CREATE | 3 years post-verification | DESTROY |
| Orphaned document (default) | ON_ORPHAN | 1 year | REVIEW (never auto-destroy) |

> Each row is a configured **M11 retention class** (`VAL-M11-RETENTION`); exact statutory periods are confirmed
> against governing rules at deployment and never set below the statutory floor.

### Appendix B — Classification → control map (enterprise extension over M11)

| Classification | Watermark | External share | Default key (per domain) | Search index | Audit (P05) |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------|
| PUBLIC | optional | allowed | shared CMK | full-text | yes |
| INTERNAL | optional | allowed | shared CMK | full-text | yes |
| CONFIDENTIAL | mandatory | Security approval | dedicated CMK | full-text (encrypted) | yes |
| SECRET | mandatory | blocked (internal only) | dedicated CMK | **metadata-only** | yes |
| TOP_SECRET | mandatory | blocked | dedicated CMK | **metadata-only (per-domain index)** | yes + alert |

> TOP_SECRET retained (justified, §3.3) for compartmented sealed vigilance/PI records; only `is_top_secret_eligible`
> system-seeded types; two-approver clearance required. Field masking for any document metadata carrying enterprise
> identifiers follows **RBAC v1.7 PII tiers** (§3.3), enforced by P02 on serialization.

### Appendix C — Allowed MIME types (baseline, `VAL-FILE`, per type override)

`application/pdf`, `image/tiff`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `application/msword`,
`application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`, `application/vnd.ms-excel`,
`application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`.

### Appendix D — Assumptions & caveats

- KMS (+ in-country HSM/multi-region escrow, credentials via P04), object-storage object-lock, AV (ICAP),
  sandboxed OCR/preview, DLP, PKI/eSign (`DocumentGen` SigningProvider), and an RFC-3161 TSA are available
  platform services at CGG; each is provider-abstracted.
- **Print auditing is reliable only through the platform's watermarked print path; out-of-band printing is
  best-effort** (FR-012 BR-1).
- Exact statutory retention periods are configurable M11 retention classes, confirmed at deployment.
- SHA-256 collision risk treated as cryptographically negligible for integrity/dedup.
- **The WORM guarantee must be proven on the actual CGG storage backend** before FR-014 is credible (gating
  spike, §15.3) — M11 has no WORM, so this is net-new enterprise infrastructure.
- **Audit tamper-evidence depends on confirming platform OPEN-PLAT-03** (hash-chain proposal) before build
  (Platform §Z); PS13 tracks it rather than authoring a parallel mechanism.
- Whether AV/OCR/DLP/PKI are built in-house or COTS is a deployment choice behind provider interfaces;
  data-sovereignty (NFR residency) may force on-prem implementations for PII.

### Appendix E — KMS Key-DR / Escrow Runbook (R6)

1. **Replication:** every CMK replicated to a geographically separate, **in-country** HSM/region; wrapped DEKs
   stored alongside their objects (`storage_objects.wrapped_dek`).
2. **Escrow:** CMK material escrowed under split-knowledge / dual-control (Shamir-style); no single custodian can
   extract a key. Credentials managed via **P04 `integration_credentials`**.
3. **Recovery:** on suspected loss/corruption, execute `/admin/keys:recover` (dual-control) to restore the CMK
   from escrow/replica **before** any data is declared lost; re-wrap affected DEKs if the key was rotated.
4. **Rehearsal:** the recovery drill is rehearsed **quarterly**; results feed the Key-DR posture report.
5. **Key-loss behaviour:** if recovery is genuinely impossible, affected documents are marked unrecoverable and
   reported — a *defined, alarmed* state reached only after escrow recovery fails, never a silent loss.

### Appendix F — Day-One Stub Attach/Fetch Contract (R14)

A mock service implementing the frozen contract is published on day one so all PS01–PS12 modules build against it:

- `POST /api/v1/documents:attach` → `{documentId, docNo, linkId, status:"SCANNING", securityDomain}`; accepts
  `Idempotency-Key`; `X-Correlation-Id` echoed.
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}:fetch?intent=VIEW` → `renderUrl` (stub streams a placeholder watermarked PDF),
  `downloadAvailable:false`.
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}:fetch?intent=DOWNLOAD` → `downloadUrl` only if the stub token carries the DOWNLOAD
  right, else `403`.
- Error catalog (§10.3) returned verbatim with the **platform envelope** (`{error:{code,message,field,details}}`,
  `X-Correlation-Id` header), including `ERR-PS13-FETCH_INTENT_REQUIRED`, `ERR-PS13-CLEARANCE_INSUFFICIENT`, `ERR-PS13-DOCUMENT_NOT_ATTACHABLE`.
- `clearance_level` semantics published: principals default to INTERNAL; CONFIDENTIAL+ requires an ACTIVE
  `security_clearances` row that **P02** reads.

The mock's responses are byte-compatible with the production service so the cutover (§15.2) requires no module
code changes.
