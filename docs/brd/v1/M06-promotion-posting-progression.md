## Section 1 — Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Promotion, Posting & Progression Monitoring module (M06-PPP) is the statutory and managerial engine that governs how a public-sector employee **moves upward** through the organisation: how seniority is established, how promotions are adjudicated by Departmental Promotion Committees (DPCs) and promotion panels, how the resulting orders and probation are managed, how financial up-gradation schemes (ACP/MACP) are sanctioned even in the absence of a functional promotion, how the employee is **posted** into the new role, and how the organisation **monitors** every employee's progression — due-for-promotion alerts, stagnation, increment timeliness, and career-path modelling.

Promotion in a enterprise context is a quasi-judicial, rule-bound, reservation-aware, audit-heavy process. A wrongly computed seniority position, an overlooked vigilance case, a mis-applied reservation roster point, or an un-recorded probation declaration can each trigger litigation, tribunal proceedings, and the unwinding of an entire promotion batch. M06-PPP therefore treats **eligibility computation, panel adjudication, roster compliance, and immutable service-register posting** as first-class, fully-audited capabilities.

### 1.2 Business context & statutory drivers

- **Seniority** is the spine of public-sector careers. It determines eligibility zones, panel inclusion, and order-of-promotion. Tentative seniority lists are published, objections/representations invited, disposed, and a final list notified — all with statutory cut-off dates.
- **Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC)** is the constitutional body that evaluates the eligible field and prepares Select Lists. Its proceedings, benchmarks (e.g., APAR grading thresholds), and minutes are statutory records.
- **Reservation roster** (SC/ST/OBC/EWS/PwBD) compliance is mandatory; roster points, carry-forward, and de-reservation rules must be enforced and auditable.
- **Vigilance/disciplinary clearance** is a precondition; "sealed cover" procedure must be supported where a charge is pending.
- **Financial up-gradation** schemes (Time-Bound Promotion / Assured Career Progression / Modified Assured Career Progression — ACP/MACP) guarantee pay progression on completion of qualifying service (e.g., 10/20/30 years) to combat stagnation, independent of vacancy-based promotion.
- Every promotion, posting, officiating arrangement, probation declaration, and financial up-gradation is a **statutory service event** that must post to the Digital Service Register (M12) as an append-only entry.

### 1.3 Scope summary

In scope: seniority management; eligibility computation; DPC/panel workflow; select-list and promotion-order generation; probation lifecycle; ad-hoc/officiating/in-situ promotion; ACP/MACP financial up-gradation; post-promotion posting; and progression monitoring (due-for-promotion, stagnation, increment monitoring, career-path & succession modelling).

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): APAR capture & ratings (M08, referenced), disciplinary/vigilance case management (M09, referenced), lateral transfer/relieving/joining mechanics (M05, reused for posting movement), payroll fixation arithmetic execution (M10, M06 sanctions and hands off the pay event), the SR ledger itself (M12, M06 writes events).

### 1.4 Primary outcomes & KPIs

| Outcome | KPI | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Accurate seniority | Seniority objections upheld vs. raised | < 3% |
| Timely promotions | Vacancies filled within statutory DPC cycle | ≥ 95% within cycle |
| Roster compliance | Roster points filled per reservation policy | 100% audited, 0 unresolved deviations |
| Zero stagnation surprises | Eligible employees not flagged before due date | 0 |
| Financial up-gradation timeliness | MACP sanctioned within 30 days of due date | ≥ 98% |
| Audit integrity | Promotion events posted to Digital SR | 100%, reconciled |
| Litigation reduction | Promotion orders set aside on procedural grounds | Year-on-year decline |

### 1.5 Module personas (summary)

HR Officer (case preparation), Establishment/Seniority Section, DPC Member & DPC Secretary, Reviewing/Appointing Authority, Vigilance Clearance Officer, Reservation/Roster Officer, Department Head, Employee (self-service progression view & representations), SR Custodian (M12), Auditor (read-only). Full matrix in Section 3.

## Section 2 — Scope & Boundaries

### 2.1 Feature Module Map

| Sub-module | Code | Description | Key entities |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seniority Management | PPP-SEN | Cadre-wise seniority lists, eligibility zone, tentative/final lists, objections | `seniority_lists`, `seniority_entries`, `seniority_objections` |
| Eligibility Computation | PPP-ELG | Rule-driven eligibility (qualifying service, APAR, vigilance, roster) | `eligibility_rules`, `eligibility_assessments` |
| Promotion Case & DPC | PPP-DPC | Promotion case, DPC/panel constitution, proceedings, select list | `promotion_cases`, `promotion_panels`, `promotion_panel_members`, `promotion_candidates`, `dpc_proceedings` |
| Promotion Orders & Probation | PPP-ORD | Order generation, acceptance, probation period & declaration | `promotion_orders`, `probation_records` |
| Ad-hoc / Officiating / In-situ | PPP-OFF | Temporary upward arrangements pending regular promotion | `officiating_arrangements` |
| Financial Up-gradation (ACP/MACP) | PPP-FIN | Time-bound/assured career progression sanctions | `financial_upgradations`, `macp_assessments` |
| Posting after Promotion | PPP-POST | Place promoted employee into a post/station | `promotion_postings` (reuses M05 movement) |
| Reservation Roster | PPP-ROS | Roster registers, point allocation, carry-forward, de-reservation | `reservation_rosters`, `roster_points` |
| Progression Monitoring | PPP-MON | Due-for-promotion, stagnation, increment monitoring | `progression_alerts`, `increment_monitor` |
| Career-Path & Succession | PPP-CAR | Career-path models, succession plans, eligibility dashboards | `career_paths`, `career_path_stages`, `succession_plans`, `succession_candidates` |

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from Shared Foundation, applied here)

- **Maker-checker** on every statutory artefact (seniority list publication, select list approval, order issue, MACP sanction) via shared `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks`.
- **Immutable audit** (`audit_log`) on every state change; **append-only SR posting** (`service_register_events`) on every promotion/posting/financial event.
- **Document management** (M13 `documents`) for DPC minutes, orders, objection letters, roster registers — versioned, access-controlled.
- **Notifications** (shared ledger) for alerts, panel invitations, order publication, representation acknowledgements.
- **RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping**; **segregation of duties** (maker ≠ checker; no self-promotion adjudication).
- **Pagination** (max page size 100) on all list endpoints; **i18n** (DD-MMM-YYYY, INR).

### 2.3 In-scope / Out-of-scope boundary table

| Capability | In M06 | Owned/relied elsewhere |
|---|---|---|
| Seniority computation & lists | ✅ | Source person/job data from M01 |
| Eligibility rule engine | ✅ | APAR ratings from M08; disciplinary/vigilance from M09 |
| DPC / panel proceedings | ✅ | — |
| Promotion orders & probation | ✅ | Document storage M13 |
| Officiating/ad-hoc/in-situ | ✅ | — |
| ACP/MACP sanction | ✅ (sanction) | Pay fixation arithmetic & disbursement M10 |
| Posting movement execution | ✅ (initiate) | Relieving/joining mechanics reuse M05 |
| Service event ledger | Writes events | Ledger owned by M12 |
| Workforce dashboards (cross-module) | Module dashboards | Enterprise analytics M14 |

### 2.4 Assumptions & dependencies

- M01 provides authoritative `employees`, `designations`, `cadres`, `pay_scales`, `org_units`.
- M08 exposes a stable APAR rating read API (per-employee, per-year, grading + benchmark band).
- M09 exposes a disciplinary/vigilance status read API (pending charge, penalty currency, sealed-cover applicability).
- M12 accepts SR event writes idempotently (keyed by `source_module` + `source_event_id`).
- M05 provides the relieving/joining workflow that PPP-POST hands a promotion-posting movement to.
- Reservation policy parameters (percentages, roster cycle length) are configurable master data, not hard-coded.

### 5.6 Data integrity rules

1. **Unique rank per list:** `(seniority_list_id, rank_position)` and `(seniority_list_id, employee_id)` both unique; no duplicate or skipped ranks (enforced on publish).
2. **Single active final list per scope:** at most one `seniority_lists` with `list_type=FINAL, status=FINALISED` per `(cadre_id, grade_designation_id, org_unit_scope_id)`; superseding one flips the prior to `SUPERSEDED`.
3. **Eligibility immutability after DPC:** `eligibility_assessments` for a case are frozen (copy-on-write snapshot) once the case reaches `DPC_HELD`.
4. **Selected ⇒ eligible:** `promotion_candidates.is_selected=true` requires linked `eligibility_assessment.overall_result ∈ {ELIGIBLE, SEALED_COVER}` (sealed cover kept in sealed envelope, not effected until cleared).
5. **Vacancy cap:** count of `is_selected=true` candidates ≤ `promotion_cases.vacancy_count` (reserve list excluded).
6. **Roster point single fill:** a `roster_points.status=FILLED` row links exactly one `filled_by_employee_id`; reserved point cannot be filled by a non-matching category unless `DE_RESERVED`/`INTERCHANGED` with recorded authority.
7. **Order references valid candidate:** a `REGULAR_PROMOTION` order requires `candidate_id` with `dpc_verdict=FIT` and `is_selected=true`.
8. **No self-adjudication:** an employee appearing in `promotion_candidates` for a case cannot be a `promotion_panel_members` member of that case's panel (must `RECUSED`).
9. **SR posting completeness:** every `promotion_orders.status=EFFECTED`, `promotion_postings.status=JOINED`, and `financial_upgradations.status=EFFECTED` must have a non-null `sr_event_id`.
10. **MACP cap:** `financial_upgradations` count per employee ≤ 3 across scheme lifetime; `promotions_earned_count + macp_count ≤ 3` (configurable per policy).
11. **Probation arithmetic:** `scheduled_end = probation_start + probation_months`; declaration only when `status=ON_PROBATION/EXTENDED` and probation period lapsed.
12. **Effective dates monotonic:** `promotion_orders.effective_date ≥ DPC approval date` unless `notional_date` recorded with authority reference.
13. **Soft delete:** statutory entities (orders, SR-linked, finalised lists) cannot be hard-deleted; only `SUPERSEDED`/`CANCELLED` with audit.
14. **Transactional writes:** select-list approval (writes candidates + proceedings + roster points + workflow), order issue (order + SR event + notification), and MACP sanction (upgradation + order + SR event) each execute in a single DB transaction.

### FR-PPP-001 — Cadre-wise Seniority List Generation

- **Module:** PPP-SEN
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment/Seniority Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As an Establishment Officer, I want to generate a cadre/grade-scoped seniority list reckoned on a chosen date so that promotions and eligibility zones rest on a defensible seniority order.
- **Description:** System assembles all employees in a feeder grade within scope, computes a provisional rank using a configurable reckoning basis (date of joining in grade, regularisation date, merit-batch rank), applies tie-breakers (DOB, batch order), tags reservation category, and produces a `DRAFT` seniority list with ranked entries.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Given a cadre + grade + as-on date, the system lists every active employee in that feeder grade within org scope.
2. Ranks are contiguous (1..N) with no duplicates or gaps.
3. Tie-breaks apply deterministically and the applied basis is recorded per entry.
4. The draft is editable until publication; every manual rank override is audited with a reason.
5. Reservation category is populated from M01 and shown per entry.

**Business Rules**
- Reckoning basis precedence and tie-break order are configuration, not code.
- Officers on deputation/long leave are included with a status flag but retain seniority position.
- An employee may appear in exactly one active list per scope.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `seniority_lists` | Create draft header |
| `seniority_entries` | Ranked rows |
| `employees`, `designations`, `cadres` | Source population |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/seniority-lists` | Create + auto-generate entries |
| GET | `/api/v1/seniority-lists/{id}` | Fetch list + entries |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/seniority-lists/{id}/entries/{entryId}` | Manual rank override (audited) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Wizard (scope → basis → preview ranked grid). Drag-to-reorder with mandatory reason modal; tie-break column visible; export to PDF preview.

**Edge Cases:** identical DOJ and DOB (fall to next tie-break/seniority-no); employee with grade entry date missing (flagged, excluded from ranking until resolved); retro-regularisation altering position.

**LLD**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SeniorityListController`, `SeniorityComputationService`, `TieBreakResolver`, `SeniorityRepository` |
| Backend Flow | Validate scope → query feeder-grade population from M01 → apply reckoning basis → resolve ties → assign 1..N → persist header+entries in one tx |
| Data Operations | INSERT `seniority_lists` (DRAFT); bulk INSERT `seniority_entries`; audit each |
| Validation | Scope exists; as-on date not future beyond config; population non-empty |
| Authorization | `seniority.list.create` + org-unit scope |
| State Changes & Side Effects | List → DRAFT; audit_log entries; no SR posting (not yet statutory) |
| Failure Handling | Missing grade-entry date → partial result with `flagged_entries[]`; tx rollback on any constraint breach |
| Dependencies | M01 master data |
| Test Guidance | Unit: tie-break determinism; integration: contiguous-rank invariant; override audit recorded |

### FR-PPP-002 — Tentative Seniority Publication, Objections & Finalisation

- **Module:** PPP-SEN
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment Officer, Employee (objector), Appointing Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to view the tentative seniority list and file objections within the statutory window so that errors are corrected before the list is finalised.
- **Description:** Publishes a draft as `PUBLISHED_TENTATIVE`, opens a configurable objection window, lets in-scope employees file objections/representations, routes them for disposal, applies upheld corrections (re-ranking with audit), then finalises the list (`FINALISED`) and notifies.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Publication requires checker approval via workflow and freezes the entry set as the tentative baseline.
2. Objections accepted only within `[objection_window_start, objection_window_end]`.
3. Each objection has a recorded disposal (UPHELD/REJECTED/PARTIALLY_UPHELD) with remarks; objector is notified.
4. Upheld objections trigger a re-rank that preserves contiguity and is fully audited.
5. Finalisation supersedes any prior final list for the scope and produces a notified PDF stored in M13.

**Business Rules**
- Objections after window close are auto-rejected as `TIME_BARRED` unless an authority grants condonation.
- Finalisation blocked while any objection is `SUBMITTED`/`UNDER_REVIEW`.
- A finalised list is immutable; corrections post-finalisation require a fresh superseding list.

### FR-PPP-003 — Configurable Eligibility Rule Engine & Computation

- **Module:** PPP-ELG
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (rule config), HR Promotion Officer (run), Vigilance Officer (attest)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want the system to compute each employee's promotion eligibility against configured rules so that the eligible field is objective, explainable, and audit-proof.
- **Description:** Evaluates qualifying service, APAR benchmark (read from M08), vigilance/disciplinary status (read from M09), mandatory qualification, and roster applicability per `eligibility_rules`, producing an `eligibility_assessments` record with overall result and itemised pass/fail reasons including sealed-cover handling.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Qualifying service computed as continuous service in feeder grade up to `crucial_date`.
2. APAR pass = at least `apar_min_count_meeting_benchmark` of last `apar_lookback_years` meet `apar_benchmark`.
3. Pending disciplinary charge ⇒ result `SEALED_COVER`; current penalty ⇒ `NOT_ELIGIBLE` (per rule flags).
4. Every assessment stores an explainable reason set (`failure_reasons[]`).
5. Re-running re-computes only `DRAFT`/`FIELD_ASSEMBLED` cases; frozen post `DPC_HELD`.

**Business Rules**
- Rules are version-effective-dated; the rule effective on `crucial_date` applies.
- Missing APAR years are treated per policy (e.g., counted as below-benchmark or as gap-blocking alert).
- Vigilance "not cleared" overrides APAR pass.

### FR-PPP-004 — Promotion Case Creation & Eligible-Field Assembly

- **Module:** PPP-DPC
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to create a promotion case for a from→to grade with a vacancy count and assemble the zone of consideration so that the DPC evaluates the correct field.
- **Description:** Creates a `promotion_cases` record, computes the zone of consideration (e.g., vacancies × multiplier, extended zone for reserved categories), pulls candidates from the relevant final seniority list, links eligibility assessments, and marks candidates `IN_ZONE`/`EXTENDED_ZONE`/`OUT_OF_ZONE`.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Case requires a finalised seniority list for the feeder grade/scope.
2. Zone of consideration computed from configurable multiplier of `vacancy_count`.
3. Candidates ordered by seniority; reserved-category extended zone applied where roster requires.
4. Each candidate links to its eligibility assessment.
5. Case status advances DRAFT → FIELD_ASSEMBLED → ELIGIBILITY_DONE.

**Business Rules**
- Vacancy count must be sanctioned (validated against an establishment input/parameter).
- Zone multiplier and extended-zone rules are configurable.
- Out-of-zone candidates are retained for audit but not placed before DPC unless zone extended with authority.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |

### FR-PPP-005 — DPC / Promotion Panel Constitution & Proceedings

- **Module:** PPP-DPC
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer (constitute), DPC Secretary, DPC Members, Appointing Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As a DPC Secretary, I want to constitute the committee, record attendance/quorum, capture each candidate's fitness verdict against the benchmark, and compile a select list so that the promotion decision is statutorily valid.
- **Description:** Constitutes a `promotion_panels` with members (internal + external/commission nominee), records `dpc_proceedings` (benchmark applied, quorum, minutes), captures per-candidate `dpc_verdict`, builds a select list + reserve list + sealed-cover list, and routes for appointing-authority approval.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Panel constitution validates quorum config and conflict-of-interest recusal (candidate cannot be member).
2. Proceedings record benchmark, quorum-met flag, and a minutes document.
3. Each in-zone candidate receives a verdict; sealed-cover candidates flagged and excluded from effected select list.
4. Select-list count ≤ vacancy count; reserve list ordered.
5. Approval by appointing authority is a checker step distinct from the secretary/maker.

**Business Rules**
- Quorum must be met for a valid sitting; otherwise meeting recorded as adjourned.
- Benchmark applied must match the rule's `apar_benchmark` unless an authority records a deviation.
- Supersession (placing a junior above a senior) requires recorded reasons.

**Data Model References**

| POST | `/api/v1/promotion-cases/{id}/select-list/approve` | Approve select list |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Panel builder with recusal warnings; live quorum indicator; candidate evaluation grid with verdict dropdown + benchmark reference; minutes upload; select-list approval screen with vacancy/roster reconciliation panel.

**Edge Cases:** member recuses mid-meeting dropping below quorum; benchmark deviation; supersession requiring reason; sealed-cover candidate later cleared (FR-008 re-open path).

### FR-PPP-006 — Reservation Roster Management & Compliance

- **Module:** PPP-ROS
- **Primary Role(s):** Reservation/Roster Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As a Roster Officer, I want to maintain the reservation roster and validate that each promotion fills the correct roster point so that reservation policy (SC/ST/OBC/EWS/PwBD), carry-forward, and de-reservation are demonstrably compliant.
- **Description:** Maintains `reservation_rosters` and `roster_points`, assigns selected candidates to roster points by category, handles carry-forward of unfilled reserved points and de-reservation/interchange with recorded authority, and produces a roster-compliance report reconciling the case's selections against policy.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Each selected candidate maps to a roster point matching their reservation category, or an explicitly de-reserved/interchanged point.
2. Unfilled reserved points are carried forward (linked) rather than silently dropped.
3. Roster compliance report shows points filled vs. due per category with deviations.
4. De-reservation/interchange requires authority reference and is audited.
5. Roster point cannot be double-filled.

**Business Rules**
- Reservation percentages and cycle size are policy configuration.
- Backlog/carry-forward vacancies are prioritised per policy before fresh points.
- PwBD horizontal reservation applied across categories per policy.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|

| GET | `/api/v1/promotion-cases/{id}/roster-compliance` | Compliance report |

**UI Behavior Notes:** 100-point roster grid with category color legend; filled/vacant/carried-forward states; compliance panel with category tallies and deviation flags; de-reserve action with mandatory authority field.

**Edge Cases:** no eligible reserved candidate (carry-forward + possible de-reservation after policy limit); interchange between SC/ST; EWS roster overlap; over-reservation breaching 50% ceiling (warning).

### FR-PPP-007 — Promotion Order Generation, Acceptance & SR Posting

- **Module:** PPP-ORD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer (maker), Appointing Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to generate promotion orders for selected candidates, capture acceptance, and post the event to the Digital Service Register so that the promotion is legally effected and permanently recorded.
- **Description:** Generates `promotion_orders` from approved select-list candidates, produces the order document (M13), captures acceptance/decline (with deemed acceptance after a window), transitions order to `EFFECTED`, and writes an idempotent SR event to M12 — all transactionally.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Orders generate only for `is_selected=true, dpc_verdict=FIT` candidates.
2. Each order carries from/to designation + pay scale, effective (and optional notional) date.
3. Acceptance window enforced; non-response after window ⇒ `DEEMED_ACCEPTED` per policy.
4. On `EFFECTED`, an SR event is posted to M12 with `sr_event_id` stored; `employees.designation_id` update is initiated for M01.
5. Order issue + SR posting + notification occur in one transaction; partial failure rolls back.

**Business Rules**
- A declined promotion is recorded; the next reserve-list candidate may be considered per policy.
- Notional dates require authority reference; affect seniority, not arrears unless sanctioned.
- Order numbering is gap-free per series.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `promotion_orders` | order record |
| `promotion_candidates` | source |
| `service_register_events` (M12), `documents` (M13), `notifications` | side effects |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |

| POST | `/api/v1/orders/{id}/accept` | Record acceptance |
| POST | `/api/v1/orders/{id}/effect` | Effect + SR post |
| GET | `/api/v1/orders/{id}` | Fetch order |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Batch order generation with preview; per-order status chips; acceptance capture (self-service or on behalf); "Effect & Post to SR" action shows SR confirmation; declined orders surface reserve-list suggestion.

**Edge Cases:** SR (M12) unavailable at effect time (order held in `ISSUED`, retried, not falsely EFFECTED); duplicate effect call (idempotent on SR key); candidate retires/dies between selection and order (order cancelled, SR not posted).

### FR-PPP-008 — Sealed Cover Handling & Deferred/Review DPC

- **Module:** PPP-DPC
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer, Vigilance Officer, Appointing Authority
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to keep promotion recommendations of employees with pending disciplinary/vigilance proceedings in a sealed cover and open it on case conclusion so that due process is honoured without prejudicing or pre-judging the employee.
- **Description:** When eligibility yields `SEALED_COVER`, the DPC still assesses fitness but the recommendation is sealed; the post is filled provisionally/kept vacant per policy; on conclusion of the disciplinary case (M09 signal), a Review DPC opens the cover and either effects promotion (with notional date/seniority) or records supersession.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Sealed-cover candidates are flagged; their verdict is recorded but not effected.
2. The system tracks the linked M09 case and listens for its conclusion.
3. On exoneration, a Review DPC effects the promotion with notional date preserving seniority.
4. On penalty, the sealed cover results in supersession/deferral per policy, audited.
5. Sealed-cover status visible only to authorised roles.

**Business Rules**
- Sealed cover cannot remain open indefinitely; periodic review reminders generated.
- Notional promotion on exoneration may carry arrears only if separately sanctioned.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `promotion_candidates` (dpc_verdict=SEALED_COVER) | sealed record |
| `eligibility_assessments` (SEALED_COVER) | source |
| `promotion_orders` (notional_date) | on opening |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/sealed-covers?status=open` | List sealed covers |
| POST | `/api/v1/sealed-covers/{candidateId}/review` | Open cover via Review DPC |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Restricted "Sealed Covers" workspace; linked disciplinary case status badge; review action gated until M09 conclusion; notional-date input on opening.

**Edge Cases:** disciplinary case partially upheld (minor penalty) — policy decides; employee retires while sealed (handled per pension rules, flagged to M11); multiple sealed covers across cycles.

**LLD**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SealedCoverService`, `DisciplinaryGateway(M09)`, `ReviewDpcService` |
| Backend Flow | on SEALED_COVER verdict → mark sealed → subscribe to M09 conclusion → on signal → Review DPC → effect (notional) or supersede |
| Data Operations | UPDATE candidate/verdict; INSERT order on opening; audit; SR post if effected |

| Authorization | restricted to vigilance/appointing roles |
| State Changes & Side Effects | sealed→opened→(EFFECTED notional / SUPERSEDED); reminders |
| Failure Handling | M09 signal missing → periodic review alert; cannot open prematurely → `SEALED_COVER_NOT_REVIEWABLE` |

### FR-PPP-009 — Probation Lifecycle on Promotion

- **Module:** PPP-ORD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer, Reporting Manager (input), Appointing Authority (declare)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want promotion to optionally start a probation period that is tracked, extendable, and concluded by a satisfactory declaration so that confirmation in the promoted grade is properly governed.
- **Description:** On effecting a promotion that carries probation, the system creates `probation_records`, schedules the end date, raises a `PROBATION_ENDING` alert before due, supports extension or reversion, and records the satisfactory-completion declaration (which posts a confirmation SR event).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Probation auto-created when the promotion grade has a configured probation period.
2. `scheduled_end = probation_start + probation_months`.
3. Alert raised configurable days before `scheduled_end`.
4. Extension records new `extended_to` and reason; reversion transitions employee back and audits.
5. Satisfactory declaration sets `DECLARED_SATISFACTORY` and posts a confirmation SR event.

**Business Rules**
- Multiple extensions allowed up to a policy cap.
- Reversion during probation reverses the promotion order (`SUPERSEDED`) with SR posting.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |

### FR-PPP-010 — Ad-hoc / Officiating / In-situ Promotion

- **Module:** PPP-OFF
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer, Department Head, Appointing Authority
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want to place an employee in a higher post on ad-hoc/officiating/in-situ basis pending a regular DPC so that operational continuity is maintained without bypassing due process.
- **Description:** Creates `officiating_arrangements` of a chosen type with start (and optional end) dates, optional officiating pay, links to a pending regular promotion case, supports extension/termination, and regularises into a regular promotion order when the DPC concludes (preserving service for seniority/MACP as policy allows).

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Arrangement records type, post, org unit, dates, and pay eligibility.
2. Ad-hoc/officiating duration tracked; extensions audited; lapses auto-flagged.
3. Linking to a regular case enables one-click regularisation on DPC selection.
4. Regularisation creates a regular order and closes the arrangement (`REGULARISED`).
5. Arrangement posts an SR event (officiating start/end).

**Business Rules**
- Ad-hoc promotion confers no automatic seniority unless regularised.
- Officiating pay allowed only when the arrangement type/policy permits.
- An employee cannot hold two conflicting upward arrangements for the same post simultaneously.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |

| POST | `/api/v1/officiating/{id}/terminate` | Terminate |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Arrangement form with type and pay toggle; active-arrangements list with duration meter; regularise CTA appears when linked case is `SELECT_LIST_APPROVED`.

**Edge Cases:** officiating exceeds permissible duration (compliance flag); regular DPC supersedes the officiating incumbent (officiating terminated, not regularised); overlapping arrangements (blocked).

### FR-PPP-011 — Financial Up-gradation (ACP/MACP) Sanction

- **Module:** PPP-FIN
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Promotion Officer (maker), Screening Committee, Appointing Authority (sanction)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want the system to detect when an employee is due for a financial up-gradation (TBP/ACP/MACP) on completing qualifying service and to process the screening and sanction so that stagnating employees get assured pay progression on time.
- **Description:** Continuously evaluates qualifying service to flag `financial_upgradations` as `DUE`, runs a screening-committee assessment (`macp_assessments`) against the benchmark, applies the up-gradation cap (max three, counting regular promotions), sanctions the next pay level, generates a MACP order (reusing FR-007), and posts the SR + hands the pay event to M10.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Due detection on completing the configured qualifying service (e.g., 10/20/30 years) with no qualifying promotion in the interim.
2. Screening assessment records benchmark-met; failing benchmark defers per policy.
3. Total financial up-gradations + regular promotions capped per policy (default 3).
4. Sanction grants the next pay level effective from due date; deferred if penalty current.
5. Sanction creates a `MACP` order, posts SR, and emits a pay-fixation event to M10.

**Business Rules**
- MACP counts promotions already availed; a regular promotion may reset/adjust the MACP clock per policy.
- Refusal of regular promotion may affect MACP entitlement per policy.
- Deferral on disciplinary penalty currency; re-evaluated on penalty expiry.

**Data Model References**

| POST | `/api/v1/financial-upgradations/{id}/sanction` | Sanction + order + SR |
| POST | `/api/v1/financial-upgradations/{id}/defer` | Defer |

**UI Behavior Notes:** MACP due dashboard with countdown and cap tracker; screening form with benchmark; sanction action shows pay-level change preview; deferred items with reason.

**Edge Cases:** employee took regular promotion shortly before MACP due (recompute clock); penalty imposed between due and sanction (defer); cap reached (no further up-gradation, informational).

- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to post a promoted employee to a specific post/station and drive the relieving/joining through the transfer workflow so that the promotion translates into an actual placement with a clean service record.
- **Description:** Creates `promotion_postings` for an effected promotion, selects the destination org unit/post and posting type, hands a movement to the M05 relieving/joining workflow, tracks relieving and joining, and posts the posting/joining SR event on completion.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Posting can be created only for an `EFFECTED` promotion order.
2. Destination post/org unit validated as sanctioned/vacant.
3. M05 movement reference stored; status reflects RELIEVED/JOINED.
4. Report-by date enforced; non-joining handled per policy.
5. On JOINED, a posting SR event is posted and `employees.org_unit_id` update initiated for M01.

**Business Rules**
- A promotion may be local (no station change) or out-station (full relieving/joining).
- Failure to join by deadline may lead to order review per policy.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `promotion_postings` | posting record |
| `promotion_orders` | source |
| M05 movement, `service_register_events` | side effects |

**API References**

| POST | `/api/v1/orders/{id}/postings` | Create posting |
| GET | `/api/v1/postings/{id}` | Status |
| POST | `/api/v1/postings/{id}/sync-movement` | Sync with M05 |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Posting form with destination picker and vacancy check; movement status timeline (relieved → in-transit → joined); report-by countdown.

**Edge Cases:** no vacant post at destination (blocked/queued); employee declines posting (links to acceptance in FR-007); local promotion (skip relieving, immediate join).

### FR-PPP-013 — Progression Monitoring (Due-for-Promotion, Stagnation, Increment)

- **Module:** PPP-MON
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Reporting Manager, Employee (self), System (scheduler)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want the system to proactively flag who is due for promotion, who is stagnating, whose increment is due, and whose probation/APAR blocks progression so that no entitlement is missed and no employee stagnates unseen.
- **Description:** A scheduled engine evaluates each employee against career rules and generates `progression_alerts` (DUE_FOR_PROMOTION, MACP_DUE, STAGNATION, INCREMENT_DUE, PROBATION_ENDING, APAR_GAP_BLOCKING) and maintains `increment_monitor` rows; surfaces dashboards and self-service progression timelines; supports acknowledgement/action.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Alerts generated on configurable lead time before due dates; deduplicated per employee/type/cycle.
2. Stagnation defined as years in grade beyond a configurable threshold without promotion/up-gradation.
3. Increment due rows track ANNUAL/STAGNATION/EFFICIENCY_BAR with release/withhold status.
4. Employees see their own progression timeline and open alerts.
5. Alerts can be acknowledged, actioned (linking to a case/MACP), or dismissed with reason.

**Business Rules**
- Alert thresholds are configuration per cadre/grade.
- APAR gaps blocking eligibility raise `APAR_GAP_BLOCKING` to prompt M08 follow-up.
- Increment withheld due to penalty (M09) is reflected and auto-released on expiry.

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `progression_alerts`, `increment_monitor` | monitoring |
| `eligibility_assessments`, `financial_upgradations` | inputs |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/progression/alerts?type=&status=` | List alerts |
| POST | `/api/v1/progression/alerts/{id}/acknowledge` | Acknowledge |
| GET | `/api/v1/employees/{id}/progression-timeline` | Self timeline |
| POST | `/api/v1/progression/run` | Trigger run (admin) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** HR monitoring dashboard with alert counts by type/severity; filters by cadre/org; employee self-service timeline (joining → grades → promotions → upcoming due dates); increment register grid.

**Edge Cases:** employee due in two cycles simultaneously (dedupe by cycle); alert generated then employee promoted (alert auto-closed); increment withheld then penalty set aside (auto-release).

**LLD**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ProgressionEngine`, `AlertScheduler`, `IncrementMonitorService`, `EligibilityEngine(reuse)` |
| Backend Flow | nightly job → evaluate each in-scope employee → compute due/stagnation/increment → upsert alerts (dedupe) → notify; ack/action handlers |
| Data Operations | UPSERT progression_alerts, increment_monitor; notifications; audit |

| Authorization | HR/manager read scope; employee self only |
| State Changes & Side Effects | alerts OPEN→ACKNOWLEDGED→ACTIONED/DISMISSED/EXPIRED; notifications |
| Failure Handling | job partial failure → resumable checkpoint; missing thresholds → config alert |

### FR-PPP-014 — Career-Path Modelling, Succession Planning & Eligibility Dashboard

- **Module:** PPP-CAR
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, System Administrator (templates), Employee (self view)
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want to model career paths, maintain succession plans for critical positions, and view eligibility dashboards so that the organisation plans talent flow and an employee understands their growth route.
- **Description:** Defines `career_paths` with ordered `career_path_stages` (designation, typical tenure, competencies linked to M07), builds `succession_plans` with ranked `succession_candidates` and readiness levels for critical positions, and presents an eligibility dashboard projecting who becomes eligible when.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. A career path is an ordered sequence of designations with typical tenure and competency links.
2. Employees can view their mapped career path and next stage with projected eligibility date.
3. Succession plans identify critical positions, incumbents, risk of loss, and ranked successors with readiness.
4. Eligibility dashboard projects upcoming eligible cohorts per grade/cycle.
5. Templates are configurable by admin; plans are versioned.

**Business Rules**
- Career-path stages must reference valid designations; ordering unique and contiguous.
- Succession readiness derived from tenure, APAR, and competency coverage (advisory, not auto-promotion).
- Critical-position risk is set by HR/dept head, not auto-computed (may be assisted).

**Data Model References**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `career_paths`, `career_path_stages` | path model |
| `succession_plans`, `succession_candidates` | succession |
| `eligibility_assessments` | dashboard projection |

**API References**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT | `/api/v1/career-paths` | Manage paths |
| GET | `/api/v1/employees/{id}/career-path` | Self path |
| GET/POST | `/api/v1/succession-plans` | Manage plans |
| GET | `/api/v1/eligibility-dashboard?grade=&cycle=` | Projection |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Career-path visual stepper; succession "9-box"-style readiness grid; eligibility dashboard with cohort projection and drill-down; employee self-service growth view.

**Edge Cases:** position with no ready successor (bench-risk highlight); employee mapped to multiple paths (primary path flagged); designation deprecated mid-path (path versioned).

**LLD**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `CareerPathService`, `SuccessionService`, `EligibilityProjectionService`, `CompetencyGateway(M07)` |
| Backend Flow | manage path templates → map employees → compute projected eligibility (reuse engine) → render dashboards; succession plan CRUD with readiness |
| Data Operations | CRUD career_paths/stages, succession_plans/candidates; audit |
| Validation | contiguous stage order; valid designations; readiness enum |
| Authorization | template: admin; plans: HR/dept head; self view: employee |
| State Changes & Side Effects | plan status DRAFT→ACTIVE→REVIEWED→ARCHIVED |
| Failure Handling | invalid stage order → `CAREER_PATH_INVALID`; deprecated designation → version + warn |
| Dependencies | M07 competencies, FR-003 |
| Test Guidance | stage ordering; projection accuracy; readiness grid; self-view scoping |

- Dark mode supported via design tokens; no hardcoded colors.
- Every list paginated (max 100), with server-side sort/filter; empty/loading/error/success/permission states explicit (no skeleton-only screens).
- Destructive/statutory actions (finalise, effect order, sanction MACP, revert probation) require confirmation with summary of side effects (SR posting, pay change).
- Dates display DD-MMM-YYYY; money INR formatted; all times shown in user timezone.
- Row-level scoping: users see only data within their org/cadre authorisation.

## Section 9 — API & Integration

### 9.1 Conventions

- Base path `/api/v1`; JSON; JWT bearer; RBAC + org scoping enforced server-side.
- All list endpoints support `?page=&limit=` (max 100), `?sort=`, and resource-specific filters; responses include `pagination` metadata.
- Idempotency: SR-posting and order-effecting endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key` header; SR writes keyed by `source_module=M06` + `source_event_id`.

## Section 14 — Migration & Launch

### 14.1 Data migration

| Step | Source | Target | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Legacy seniority lists | Existing registers/spreadsheets | `seniority_lists`/`seniority_entries` | rank contiguity; employee match by service_no |
| Past promotions | Service books / legacy HRMS | `promotion_orders` (status=EFFECTED, historical) | designation transitions valid; SR backfill |
| Existing MACP grants | Pay records | `financial_upgradations` (EFFECTED) | cap ≤ 3; scheme/level mapping |
| Active officiating | Office orders | `officiating_arrangements` (ACTIVE) | no overlaps |
| Reservation rosters | Roster registers | `reservation_rosters`/`roster_points` | cycle integrity; filled points reconcile |
| Ongoing probations | Service records | `probation_records` | end-date arithmetic |

- Migration runs in a staging environment; reconciliation report must show 0 unmatched mandatory records before cutover.
- Historical SR backfill posts idempotently to M12 with `historical=true` flag.

### 14.2 Configuration before launch

- Eligibility rules per grade pair; zone multipliers; benchmark thresholds.
- Reservation policy parameters; roster cycle sizes.
- Probation periods per grade; MACP qualifying-year schedule and cap.
- Alert lead times and stagnation thresholds; career-path templates.

### 14.3 Launch strategy

- Phase 1: Seniority + eligibility (read-only verification with HR).
- Phase 2: Promotion case → DPC → orders + SR posting (pilot cadre).
- Phase 3: MACP, officiating, posting integration with M05/M10.
- Phase 4: Progression monitoring, career-path/succession, dashboards.
- Each phase gated by reconciliation against legacy and SR posting verification.

### 14.4 Rollback & cutover

- Feature-flagged module; legacy registers retained read-only during parallel run.
- Rollback plan: disable write endpoints, retain data, revert to legacy for in-flight cases; no SR events deleted (corrections only).
