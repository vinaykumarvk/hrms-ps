### 1.1 Traceability convention
Every case carries `Traces-to` = `FR-PPP-NNN` + AC/BR/edge-case or contract clause. Negative cases assert the **exact** `error.code` in the platform envelope and the wire HTTP status (e.g. `ENTITY_SUB_JUDICE` → **412**; most PS06 domain codes → **409**). The correlation id is asserted in the `X-Correlation-Id` **response header**, never the body.

### 1.2 Test environment & data assumptions
1. **Multi-tenant.** Seed ≥2 tenants (`ten-01`, `ten-02`) and ≥2 entities (`ent-07`, `ent-09`). Every list/read query must resolve a tenant/entity scope; a scopeless query is rejected (P02 step 7), not defaulted to all.
2. **Masters (PS01).** Cadre `cad-ASO`; feeder grade `desg-ASO`; promotion grade `desg-SO`; pay-scales attached. ≥30 active incumbents in `desg-ASO` with mixed `recruitment_stream ∈ {DIRECT, PROMOTEE, LDCE}`, reservation categories `{GEN, OBC, SC, ST, EWS, PwBD}`, and DOJ/DOB values including one identical-DOJ+DOB pair and one missing grade-entry-date row.
3. **Establishment (FR-015).** `sanctioned_posts` row `sp-SO-HO` with `sanctioned_strength=20`, `filled_count=14`, `dr_quota_pct=25`, `promotion_quota_pct=67`, `ldce_quota_pct=8`, sanction-order ref present.
4. **QSL (FR-016).** `qualifying_service_ledger` snapshots seeded per employee/grade at `crucial_date=2026-01-01`; `service_exclusion_rules` pinned per Appendix D.3 (EOL beyond condonable, dies-non, suspension, ad-hoc, deputation).
5. **APAR (PS08) seeded by reference.** For `emp-1001`: 5 usable years meeting benchmark. For `emp-1110`: an adverse entry with `apar_communicated=false`. For `emp-1120`: adverse entry `apar_communicated=true, representation_status=DISPOSED` (usable).
6. **Disciplinary/vigilance (PS09) seeded by reference.** `emp-1200` pending charge (⇒ SEALED_COVER); `emp-1201` current penalty (⇒ NOT_ELIGIBLE); `emp-1200` case concluded=EXONERATED available for the sealed-cover review path; suspension facts for QSL.
7. **Quota rule (FR-020).** `seniority_quota_rules` `qr-ASO` = DR:Promotee:LDCE `3:2:1`, `rotation_method=ROTA_QUOTA`, matching Appendix D.4 worked vector.
8. **Roles (auth-matrix PS06).** Provision distinct principals: `ps06_establishment_officer`, `ps06_strength_officer`, `ps06_roster_officer`, `ps06_vigilance_clearance`, `ps06_dpc_secretary`, `ps06_dpc_member` (×3), `ps06_appointing_authority`, `ps06_reviewing_authority`, `ps06_legal_officer`, `sr_custodian`, plus an `employee` and an out-of-scope tenant principal.
9. **Config.** Objection window, panel validity, probation months, MACP cap=3, debarment months, zone slab (Appendix D.1) — all set via config cascade before run. `REFUSAL_POLICY_MISSING` fixture: one cadre with debarment/MACP-clock config deliberately absent.
10. **Idempotency.** All unsafe POSTs send `Idempotency-Key` + `X-Correlation-Id`; 24h replay returns the original result.

| Test data | `PATCH /candidates/{id}/verdict` as `ps06_dpc_secretary` |
| Expected | `403 FORBIDDEN`; only `ps06_dpc_member` may grade. |
| Priority | P2 |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-097** | Authorization — SR post write enforces maker ≠ checker |
| Traces-to | auth `ps06.sr.post` sod; §9.7.1 |
| Test data | `POST /sr/ingest` where writer == the checker of the originating order |
| Expected | `403 FORBIDDEN` (SoD) / P01-enforced maker≠checker on the SR write. |
| Priority | P2 |

### Cross-cutting — API-Contract

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-098** | API-Contract — Canonical error envelope + correlation id header |
| Traces-to | taxonomy envelope §1 |
| Test data | Any negative (e.g. TC-052) |
| Expected | Body = `{error:{code,message,field,details}}` and nothing else; `X-Correlation-Id` in **response header**, not body; message resolved from an ERR-*/MSG-* id. |
| Priority | P1 |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-099** | API-Contract — Cursor pagination bound (default 25 / max 100) |
| Traces-to | conventions `pagination_bound`; OpenAPI Limit/Cursor |
| Test data | `GET /promotion-cases/{id}/candidates?limit=500` and default |
| Expected | `limit` clamped to max 100; `next_cursor` returned; stable ordering by `sort`. |
| Priority | P2 |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-100** | API-Contract — Idempotency-Key required on unsafe POST; 24h replay |
| Traces-to | conventions; OpenAPI IdempotencyKey |
| Test data | `POST /promotion-cases` without `Idempotency-Key`, then twice with same key |
| Expected | Missing key → rejected per contract; same-key replay within 24h returns the original result (no duplicate case). |
| Priority | P1 |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-101** | Data-Integrity — No double SR-claim of the pay event |
| Traces-to | §9.7.1 pay-fixation boundary; FR-PPP-007 AC4 / FR-PPP-011 AC5 |
| Test data | Inspect all SR calls from `effect` and `sanction` |
| Expected | PS06 emits only establishment codes (`PROMOTION/OFFICIATING/MACP/CONFIRMATION/POSTING/REVERSION`); **never** `PAY_FIXATION`/`ANNUAL_INCREMENT` and never a `TRANSFER/RELIEVING/JOINING` code — those belong to PS10/PS05. |
| Priority | P1 |

### Cross-cutting — E2E Flow

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-102** | E2E-Flow — DPC → promotion order → effect posts PROMOTION to /sr/ingest |
| Traces-to | FR-PPP-004→005→006→007; state 11.2/11.3; §9.7.1 |
| Preconditions | Finalised seniority list; sanctioned post; eligible field; roster |
| Test data | assemble-field → compute-eligibility → constitute panel → verdicts FIT → approve select list (≤ vacancies, roster ok) → generate orders → accept → effect |
| Steps | Drive the full chain end to end for a clean candidate. |
| Expected | Case `DRAFT→FIELD_ASSEMBLED→ELIGIBILITY_DONE→PANEL_CONSTITUTED→DPC_HELD→SELECT_LIST_APPROVED→ORDERS_ISSUED`; order `ISSUED→ACCEPTED→EFFECTED`; a single SR `PROMOTION` event posted to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` with correct dedup tuple + `fact_key` + tenant/entity; probation created; roster point tagged; PS01 designation signal emitted; **no** pay SR from PS06. |
| Priority | P1 |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-103** | E2E-Flow — MACP due → screen → sanction posts MACP to /sr/ingest, pay event to PS10 |
| Traces-to | FR-PPP-011; FR-PPP-016; §9.7.1 |
| Preconditions | QSL net years meet threshold; no current penalty; cap<3 |
| Test data | `JOB-PS06-MACP-DUE` → `screen` → `sanction` |
| Expected | `financial_upgradation` `DUE→UNDER_SCREENING→SANCTIONED→EFFECTED`; SR `MACP` posted by PS06 (source_reference_id = upgradation id); pay-fixation handed to PS10; cap and QSL citation honoured. |
| Priority | P1 |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **TC-PS06-104** | E2E-Flow — Officiating → regular DPC selects another → SUPERSEDED_BY_REGULAR |
| Traces-to | FR-PPP-010 AC4; state 11.5 |
| Preconditions | Active officiating on `sp-SO-HO`; regular case selects a different incumbent |
| Test data | approve regular select-list → attempt regularise → terminate |
| Expected | Regularise refused (`NO_REGULAR_SELECTION`); arrangement → `SUPERSEDED_BY_REGULAR`; SR `OFFICIATING_CANCELLED` posted; regular order effected for the selected candidate. |
| Priority | P2 |
