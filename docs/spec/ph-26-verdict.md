# PH-26 (Remediation Tranche 13) — Human-Gate Verdict

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Chains from:** `docs/spec/ph-25-verdict.md` (tranche 12)
**Baseline:** `docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md`
**Branch:** ph02-rerun (merged to main per sub-phase)

## Suite evidence (oracle-recomputed)

- API `npm test`: **456 pass**, 0 fail, 1 skipped (DATABASE_URL-gated PH-06 persistence test).
- Web `npm run web:test`: **121 pass**, 0 fail.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run web:typecheck`: green.

All three PH-26A..C oracles were run **externally** by the driver and are GREEN; each carries a
fail-closed negative asserted via `error.code ===` in an executed `ph26*-*.test.cjs`. Built by hand —
subagents remain credit-exhausted until 2026-07-08.

> **GREEN here is necessary, not sufficient.** A GREEN oracle means the tranche's named behaviors are
> built and tested; it does NOT mean the BRDs are complete. This gate requires a human to review the
> residual gaps below before the pipeline advances.

## What tranche 13 closed (delta vs the 2026-07-03 baseline)

| Module | Closed in PH-26 | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **PS13** | OCR extraction engine binding — OcrProvider seam + built-in extractor (text is EXTRACTED from the payload, not caller-supplied), unsupported-format guard | `ph26a-ps13-ocr-engine.test.cjs` |
| **PS12** | RFC-3161 timestamp authority binding — LocalTimestampAuthority issues a token over a digest with a keyed signature; verify detects a tampered digest | `ph26b-ps12-tsa.test.cjs` |
| **PS14** | probabilistic predictive analytics + fairness — attrition scoring that EXCLUDES protected features (rejects protected input) + a disparity metric over a monitored attribute | `ph26c-ps14-predictive.test.cjs` |

## Remaining gaps (still open — this is NOT a 100% claim)

Tranche 13 closed the last of the real-engine bindings; the residual is now dominated by **UI
surfaces** plus a few deep-analytics/tax edge cases and a build-pipeline gate:

- **PS01**: privacy/DPDP console UI (the DSR engine exists from PH-15E).
- **PS02**: additional fraud/velocity detectors.
- **PS03**: backdated-leave team-calendar conflict threshold.
- **PS04**: CI port-conformance gate in the build pipeline (runtime conformance exists).
- **PS05**: interactive counselling UI (the counselling engine exists from PH-16D).
- **PS06**: sealed-cover full workflow UI.
- **PS07**: content/assessment-item bank.
- **PS08**: calibration analytics depth.
- **PS09**: POSH conciliation depth, evidence-vault UI listing.
- **PS10**: remaining TDS edge cases, Form-16 Part-A remittance matching depth.
- **PS14**: embedded BI dashboards, mobile briefing.

**Contract-op coverage caveat:** implemented routes still cover only a small fraction of the **1,306**
OpenAPI operations frozen in `docs/contracts/openapi/*.yaml`. "All oracles GREEN" reflects the tranche's
targeted behaviors, not full API coverage.

## Recommendation for the human reviewer

Approve PH-26D to record the tranche as reviewed, OR direct a further tranche (PH-27) scoped from the
remaining-gaps list above — the next tranches are predominantly **web UI surfaces** wiring the
already-built engines (DSR console, counselling UI, evidence-vault listing) into forms and states.
Carried engineering debts (unchanged): the newest hand-built services (PH-16F..PH-26) use in-memory
repositories only; and the `ph06-persistence` migration-list assertion froze at 0008.
