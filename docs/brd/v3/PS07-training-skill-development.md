# Training and Skill Development Management — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS07, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Module code:** PS07 (alias `PS-M07`; supersedes `M07-TSD`) — see `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §B.
**Program:** PrimeSoft HRMS — a public-sector configuration and extension of the **PrimeSoft HRMS** platform (Vision §1.1), hosted at the CGG Data Centre / enterprise cloud (Standalone / Group-Company deployment model, Vision §1.4).
**Document version:** v3.0 (platform re-grounded on PrimeSoft Master BRD v2.1 · Vision v2.6 · Platform Spec v1.6 · RBAC v1.7 · Foundation FS v1.6).
**Status:** Approved for build, conditional on v3 amendments (platform-native, parallel-agent ready).
**Supersedes:** v2.0 (`/Users/n15318/hrms/docs/brd/v2/M07-training-skill-development.md`) and v1.0.
**Relationship to platform:** **NET-NEW / EXTEND.** PrimeSoft Phase-1 has **no dedicated L&D/LMS module** — the Product Vision lists the "Employee Learning Center" as a future phase (RBAC Appendix B; `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A row PS07). PS07 is therefore authored as a **platform-native module** whose competency framework, training calendar, nominations, certifications and campaigns are **new business logic** that **runs on the existing platform engines** — nomination/approval on **P01**, jobs on **X.1**, LMS/LRS integration on **X.3**, forms on **W.2**, audit on **P05**, authz on **P02**, notifications on **X.2**, migration on **P06**. It consumes the real employee master (**PS01**), feeds appraisal skill-gaps to **PS08**, and posts significant certifications/trainings to the **PS12 Service Register ledger** (which itself runs on the **P05** substrate).
**Grounding contract:** This BRD **consumes** the PrimeSoft platform contracts by id and **never re-authors** them (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §1, §9). Platform entities (`workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`, `audit_log`/`security_audit_log`, `notifications`, `documents`, `consent_records`, `integration_credentials`, `migration_runs`, `employees`/`org_units`/`roles`/`designations`) are **referenced, not redefined**. Where the platform genuinely lacks a enterprise capability it is marked **`GAP (enterprise-specific)`** and authored here, still running on the named engines.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Training and Skill Development Management module (**PS07**) closes the loop between **what the workforce can do today** and **what each role demands**, built as a **platform-native extension of PrimeSoft**. It establishes a governed **competency and skill framework**, maintains a per-employee **skill inventory** with **freshness/decay controls**, computes **incremental skill-gap analysis**, converts gaps into a governed **annual training plan and calendar**, manages the full **training delivery lifecycle** (catalog, nomination, scheduling, attendance, assessment, Kirkpatrick evaluation, certification), runs **mandatory-compliance campaigns at workforce scale**, tracks induction training, governs the **training budget**, captures **externally-acquired professional credentials**, manages **vendor empanelment and sponsorship/service-bond obligations**, and **posts significant trainings and qualifications to the statutory Digital Service Register (PS12, on the P05 substrate)**.

Every approval/maker-checker process in this module is a **configured P01 workflow (W.1 flow definition)**, every data-collection screen is a **W.2 form** referencing the shared `VAL-*` library, every scheduled process is a **JOB-PS07-\*** registered on the **X.1** runner, and every external LMS/LRS exchange runs on the **X.3 integration framework** — not a bespoke engine.

### 1.2 Business context
For a public-sector employer, training is not only a capability lever but a **statutory and audit obligation**: mandatory compliance training (conduct rules, cyber-security, POSH, ethics), induction for new entrants, and the recording of significant qualifications/trainings in the service register are legally consequential. PS07 combines **world-class HCM learning capabilities** (learning paths, skills marketplace, micro-learning, LMS/LRS/SCORM/xAPI integration via X.3, AI/rule recommendations, CPD credit tracking) with **public-sector rigour** (P01 maker-checker nominations, budget sanction, P02-enforced segregation of duties, P05 immutable audit, PS12 SR posting).

The v2 revision **separated the statutory spine from the developmental layer** (council First-Principles finding). v3 **preserves that separation** and re-anchors both layers onto the platform: the statutory spine — mandatory-compliance campaigns, certification, induction, and PS12 SR posting — is launch-required, high-volume, and proven end-to-end on a pilot entity first. The developmental layer — weighted competency scoring, recommendations, and the skills marketplace — remains feature-flagged Phase 2 (capability flags registered in **RBAC §4.3**), gated on **evidence of framework curation**.

### 1.3 Key outcomes
- A single competency taxonomy and role-based competency models, **with review cadence and ownership**, drive objective skill-gap measurement; framework masters publish through a **P01 master-data approval flow**.
- Skill inventory carries **freshness**: stale, never-revalidated skills are discounted from gap closure; freshness is recomputed by **JOB-PS07-FRESHNESS** on X.1.
- Training needs originate from three reconciled sources: competency gaps, **PS08 appraisal development gaps** imported via a versioned X.3-governed feed, and statutory mandates.
- Mandatory annual training for the entire workforce is orchestrated by a **campaign engine** (bulk nominate → auto-wave into capacity-bounded sessions → rolling renewal → escalation), driven by **JOB-PS07-CAMPAIGN** and reachable even by **non-login field staff** via attributed kiosk/assisted/offline capture.
- Every nomination, attendance mark, assessment, certificate, credential, and cost entry is captured immutably by the **P05 DB-trigger audit** and traceable to a need.
- Significant trainings/qualifications post automatically to the **PS12 SR ledger** as append-only events using a **pinned event contract**, through the **X.3** outbound pattern (idempotent, circuit-broken, payload-versioned).

### 1.4 Scope summary
PS07 owns competency/skill master data, the skill inventory, training programs and sessions, content/assessment-item assets, nominations, campaigns, attendance, assessment, feedback, certification, external credentials, learning paths, CPD records, the training budget, vendor empanelment, sponsorship/service-bond records, and LMS/LRS-integration metadata. It **consumes** the PrimeSoft employee master (**PS01**), PS08 appraisal gaps, org structure, **platform `documents` (PS13)** and **`notifications` (X.2)**; it **writes events to the PS12 SR ledger** and **datamarts to PS14**. Every entity it owns carries **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`** and is scoped at the data layer (Platform §0.1).

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### 2.1 In scope
1. Skill taxonomy and competency framework (categories, skills, competencies, proficiency-level catalog **with behavioural anchors**).
2. Role-based competency models with required proficiency targets, **scope key for ROLE (`role_id`)**, **review cadence and ownership**.
3. Per-employee skill inventory with self/manager/validated assessment, **currency/expiry and freshness/decay**.
4. **Incremental** skill-gap analysis vs competency model and reconciled with **PS08** appraisal development gaps; **binary critical/non-critical at launch**, weighted scoring feature-flagged.
5. Training needs identification, consolidation, and prioritisation.
6. Annual training calendar and plan with budget allocation (**canonical entity/org-unit + FY reconciliation key**).
7. Course catalog and program management: internal, external, e-learning/LMS, blended, micro-learning.
8. **Content & assessment-item management**: SCORM/xAPI content packages, versions, item banks, accessibility metadata.
9. Session/batch scheduling, trainer management, venue management, capacity and waitlist (**with persisted waitlist position**).
10. Nomination and multi-level approval workflow **on P01** (maker-checker, budget sanction).
11. **Mandatory-compliance campaign engine**: bulk/wave nomination, rolling renewal, escalation, coverage tracking.
12. Attendance capture (per session/day) including **proxy/kiosk/assisted and offline-sync** capture for non-login staff; pre/post assessment; Kirkpatrick L1–L4 (L3/L4 optional/sampled/programme-level).
13. Certification issuance, validity, **enforced** renewal/recertification with auto re-nomination; lapsed-mandatory flag (consumed by PS06).
14. **External & professional credential capture with issuer verification.**
15. Induction/onboarding training (driven by the PS01 joiner event).
16. Learning paths, skill-based recommendations, CPD/credit tracking, skills marketplace (Phase-2 feature-flagged).
17. **Vendor/external-trainer empanelment & procurement linkage.**
18. **Sponsorship / study-leave / deputation with service-bond obligation tracking.**
19. LMS/LRS integration (SCORM 1.2/2004 via reporting-API poll; xAPI via LRS) enrollment and completion sync, **on the X.3 framework**.
20. Training budget and cost tracking (planned vs committed vs actual; **cost-per-completion**).
21. Posting of significant trainings/qualifications to the **PS12 SR ledger** using a **pinned event contract** and an explicit **`is_significant` rule set**.
22. **DPDP retention/erasure of learning PII** at employee exit (executing through the P05 redaction-marker path).
23. **Published Gap Contract** consumed by PS06/PS08.

### 2.2 Out of scope (owned elsewhere / by the platform)
- Employee master record and job data → **PS01** (PrimeSoft `employees` master; PS07 reads it).
- Appraisal goals, ratings, and the development-gap source data → **PS08** (PS07 consumes a read-only feed via the pinned contract; PS08 = PrimeSoft M09 Performance extended).
- Promotion/seniority decisions that may consider training → **PS06** (PS07 supplies certification + Gap Contract data; decision is PS06).
- Payroll disbursement of training reimbursements and sponsorship recoveries → **PS10** (PS07 supplies an approved-cost / bond-recovery payable feed only; PS10 extends PrimeSoft M06/M07 in Phase 2).
- Statutory SR ledger itself → **PS12-SR** (PS07 writes events; PS12 owns the ledger and event-contract authority, running on **P05**).
- Document binary storage and encryption → **PS13 / PrimeSoft M11 Document Management** (PS07 stores `document_id` references).
- Cross-module executive dashboards → **PS14 / PrimeSoft M16 Analytics** (PS07 exposes datamarts/queries).
- **Procurement/tendering workflow itself** → external procurement system via **X.3** (PS07 stores empanelment + contract references only).
- **The workflow, RBAC, audit, notification, job-runner, migration and configured-content engines themselves** → **P01/P02/P05/X.1/P06/W** (PS07 configures, never re-implements).

### 2.4 Common Capabilities (inherited from the platform, applied throughout)
- **Audit (P05):** every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE on a PS07 business table fires the **P05 database trigger** writing one immutable `audit_log` row — including **FIFO waitlist promotions** and **campaign wave assignments**. Auth/permission events go to `security_audit_log`. PS07 **does not define its own audit table** (override per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C).
- **Soft delete:** `is_deleted` on all non-ledger entities; ledgers (assessment results, SR events, credential verifications, retention actions) are append-only. No hard delete (Platform §8.2).
- **Maker-checker (P01):** nominations, budget changes, certificate revocation, credential verification override, vendor empanelment, sponsorship sanction, and master-data publication run as **configured P01 flows**; SoD (maker ≠ checker, no self-approval) is enforced by **P01/P02**, never re-coded.
- **RBAC + row-level scoping (P02):** every query calls `Authorization.check`; scoping is enforced at the data layer across the five dimensions (reporting chain, `org_unit`, UAG, contribution level, entity); an unscoped query is **rejected, not defaulted to all**.
- **Pagination:** **cursor only** — `?limit=` (default 25, max 100) + `cursor=`, response carries `next_cursor` (Foundation §1). No offset paging.
- **Idempotency:** unsafe POSTs that start a transaction accept an **`Idempotency-Key`** header; a repeat within 24h returns the original result.
- **Correlation:** every request carries/receives **`X-Correlation-Id`**, echoed and written to every audit/log line.
- **i18n / locale:** UTC storage, `DD-MMM-YYYY` display, INR default, banker's rounding to paise (§5.6 rule 16).
- **Notifications (X.2 / W.3):** state transitions resolve recipients via **W.3** and dispatch through **X.2** (IN_APP + EMAIL in parallel; statutory notices mandatory/non-suppressible); templates referenced by **MSG-PS07-\*** id.
- **Documents (PS13):** all uploads (certificates, materials, attendance sheets, invoices, verification evidence) reference the platform `documents.document_id`.

### 2.5 Capability phasing & feature flags (developmental layer gating)
The statutory spine ships **on by default**. The developmental layer is **feature-flagged via RBAC capability flags (RBAC §4.3)** and gated on **framework-curation evidence** (≥ 80% of in-scope competency models within review-due date for the entity/org-unit). Flags are **Org-Admin-granted and audit-logged to P05** (RBAC §4.3).

| Capability | Capability flag (RBAC §4.3) | Default at launch | Gate to enable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binary critical/non-critical gap | (always on) | ON | — |
| Weighted decimal gap scoring | `ld.gap-weighted` | OFF | Curation evidence + L&D Manager sign-off |
| AI/rule recommendation engine | `ld.recommendations` | OFF | Curation evidence |
| Skills marketplace | `ld.marketplace` | OFF | Curation evidence + DPDP opt-in live |
| CPD targets (vs tracking) | `ld.cpd-targets` | OFF | Phase 2 |
| LRS/xAPI ingestion | `ld.lms-lrs` | OFF | LRS provisioned & X.3 round-trip validated |

## 3. Roles & Permissions

### 3.1 Roles as RBAC v1.7 ADDITIONS (no parallel scheme)
The access-control **model** is owned by **RBAC v1.7**; PS07 expresses its actors as **new roles + capability flags ADDED to the taxonomy** (RBAC §2.2/§4.3), enforced by **P02**. SoD is enforced by **P01/P02**, never re-implemented (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6; `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C). Auditor maps to **Org-Admin read + read-only entitlement**; System Administrator maps to **Org Admin / Platform Super Admin**.

**Capability flags to register in RBAC §4.3 (working-group process, RBAC §14):** `ld.gap-weighted`, `ld.campaign-launch`, `ld.credential-verify`, `ld.vendor-admin`, `ld.feature-flags`.

### 3.2 Permission matrix (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, D=Soft-delete/Disable, A=Approve, X=Execute/Operate)
> Enforcement is by **P02 `Authorization.check`** (deny-by-default → role grant → multi-role intersection → entitlement → capability flag → PII ceiling → scope filter → field mask on serialization). The matrix below is the **model input**, owned with RBAC; P02 enforces it.

Segregation-of-duties is enforced by **P02** everywhere: **maker ≠ checker**, no self-approval of one's own nomination, budget sanctioner ≠ cost recorder, vendor empanelment requester ≠ approver, credential self-capture ≠ verifier, DPO erasure approver ≠ requester. PII Protection Ceiling and field masking on serialization apply per RBAC §3.9 / Platform §P02.

## 4. Shared Platform Foundation (consumed, not redefined)

PS07 inherits the PrimeSoft platform contracts (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §4–§8). It authors business logic only.

- **Frontend:** Behaviour/NFR specified here; physical stack (React/TypeScript/Tailwind/shadcn) is an engineering choice within the platform's logical architecture (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C). WCAG 2.1 AA across screens **and assessment/e-learning content** (§9). Canonical UI-state standard (empty/loading/error/no-permission/partial-data; masked fields; `E·AR` request-change) per Foundation §3.
- **API:** REST under **`/api/v1`**; **cursor pagination**; **`Idempotency-Key`**; **`X-Correlation-Id`**; **canonical error envelope `{error:{code,message,field,details}}`** with the **8-code standard table** (Foundation §1; §10 below). Endpoints never re-implement permission logic — they call **`Authorization.check`** (P02).
- **Datastore:** PostgreSQL primary with **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`** on every table and data-layer scoping; object storage for documents via **PS13**; xAPI statements proxied through the **LRS** via **X.3** (FR-PS07-015).
- **Auth/session:** Bearer JWT carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope (P02); MFA enforced for high-privilege roles (`ld_manager`, DPO) per Vision §2.2; **kiosk/assisted sessions use an attributed operator principal**.
- **Workflow:** **P01 WorkflowEngine** (`startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel/query`, each idempotent; 5 patterns from Appendix D; in-flight version pinning) for all maker-checker and multi-level approvals.
- **Audit:** **P05** dual-log, DB-trigger, immutable, ≥ 7-yr retention; tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** (hash-chain) — PS07 does not invent a parallel mechanism.
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP ASVS, TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest, India DPDP Act 2023 alignment (incl. learning-PII erasure at exit via the P05 redaction-marker path), statutory retention.
- **Integration:** **X.3 integration framework** for all outbound/inbound external calls (LMS/LRS, procurement) — credentials from **P04 `integration_credentials`**, circuit-breaking, outbound idempotency, payload versioning, per-integration error mapping. Cross-module exchanges (PS08 gap feed, PS12 SR posting, PS10 payable, PS01 joiner) ride the platform service-contract convention (auth context + idempotency key + correlation id + standard envelope).
- **Jobs:** **X.1** runner; PS07 registers **JOB-PS07-\*** with `{job_id, schedule, tenant_scope}`; runner guarantees idempotency, exponential backoff ×3, terminal failure → `JOB-FAIL` → `MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL`, per-tenant isolation, run audit row.
- **Migration:** **P06** ETL+V — three staging dry runs, waves, `migration_runs`, **`gov_source_id`** traceability column against the legacy training register.

**Platform/enterprise entities referenced (not redefined):** `employees`/`org_units`/`users`/`roles`/`designations`/`cadres` (PS01/PrimeSoft M01), `documents` (PS13), `notifications`, `consent_records`, `integration_credentials` (P04), `workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions` (P01), `audit_log`/`security_audit_log` (P05), `migration_runs` (P06), `service_register_events` (**PS12 SR ledger** on P05).

---

## 5. Holistic Data Model

### 5.0 Platform data-model conventions (apply to every PS07 entity)
- **`tenant_id`** (non-nullable) and, where entity-scoped, **`entity_id`** on **every** PS07 business table; data-layer scoping per Platform §0.1 (an unscoped query is rejected, not defaulted to "all").
- Audit fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `is_deleted`) apply to every non-ledger entity; append-only ledgers carry only `created_at`, `created_by`. **Mutations are captured by the P05 DB trigger** — PS07 does not write audit rows in application code.
- **No locally-defined `audit_log`, `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks`, or `service_register_events`-as-platform-entity.** Those are consumed from **P05**, **P01 (`workflow_actions`)**, and the **PS12 ledger** respectively.
- Master records publish through a **P01 master-data approval flow**; `code` uniqueness uses **`VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`** (code unique within type + tenant).

### 5.6 Data integrity rules
1. **Proficiency ordering:** `skill_gap_items.gap_size = max(0, target.level_order − current.level_order)` (`VAL-PS07-GAPSIZE`); never negative.
2. **One current skill row:** `UNIQUE(tenant_id, employee_id, skill_id)` on `employee_skills`; history in `skill_assessments`.
3. **No duplicate enrolment:** `UNIQUE(tenant_id, training_session_id, employee_id)` on `training_nominations`.
4. **Capacity invariant:** `enrolled_count ≤ capacity` (`VAL-PS07-CAPACITY`); beyond capacity → WAITLISTED with persisted `waitlist_position`, not APPROVED.
5. **Score bounds:** `0 ≤ obtained_score ≤ max_score`; `result=PASS` iff `obtained ≥ pass_threshold`.
6. **Date sanity (`VAL-DATE`/`VAL-EFFECTIVE`):** `end_date ≥ start_date`; `nomination_deadline ≤ start_date`; `certifications.valid_until > issue_date`; `window_end ≥ window_start`; `vendor_empanelments.valid_until ≥ valid_from`.
7. **Budget reconciliation — canonical key (`VAL-PS07-BUDGETKEY`):** the single canonical reconciliation key is **`(financial_year, entity_id/org_unit_id)`**. `skill_category_id`/`competency_id` are **reporting dimensions only**, never reconciliation keys. The invariant `committed + actual ≤ allocated` is evaluated only at the entity/org-unit + FY grain. Worked example: budget `tb-8001` (ou-12, FY2026-2027) allocated ₹50,00,000; plan items sum ₹48,00,000 (≤ allocated ✓); committed ₹12,00,000; actual ₹3,50,000; utilisation 24%. Category breakdowns are reporting-only.
8. **SR posting only when due:** `service_register_event_id` set only when `sr_posting_status=POSTED`; significant/mandatory certs require POSTED before SUPERSEDED. Significance resolved by the `is_significant` rule set (`VAL-PS07-SIGNIF`, FR-PS07-016), not ad-hoc.
9. **Append-only ledgers:** `skill_assessments`, `training_assessments`, `training_feedback`, `cpd_records`, `credential_verifications`, `learning_data_retention_actions` accept no UPDATE/DELETE; PS12 SR events are append-only on the P05 substrate.
10. **Segregation of duties (enforced by P02):** `nominated_by ≠ approver`; budget `approved_by ≠ training_costs.created_by`; empanelment requester ≠ `approved_by`; credential self-capture ≠ `verified_by`; retention requester ≠ DPO `approved_by`.
11. **Mandatory completion:** a mandatory/campaign nomination cannot be CANCELLED/WITHDRAWN by the employee; only L&D with reason (`VAL-COMMENT`) → `ERR-REVOKE-FORBIDDEN`/`ERR-PS07-MANDATORY`.
12. **Referential currency & freshness:** `employee_skill` with `expires_on < today` → EXPIRED; with `last_validated_at` older than `skill.revalidation_interval_months` → `freshness_status=STALE`. **JOB-PS07-FRESHNESS** sets both nightly. STALE skills are discounted from gap closure per FR-PS07-004 policy.
13. **No polymorphic FKs:** `training_attendance.marked_by_*` and `training_assessments.assessed_by_*` use an `actor_type` discriminator + `actor_id`; integrity enforced in the service layer / via partial FKs. External trainers are never coerced into `employees`.
14. **Incremental gap recompute:** gap analysis is recomputed **event-driven** on skill/validation/model/mandate events; the full **JOB-PS07-GAPRECOMPUTE** batch is a fallback reconciliation, not the primary path.
15. **Campaign coverage denominator (`VAL-PS07-COVERAGE`):** `eligible_count = targets where is_eligible=true`; completion % measured against `eligible_count`; exemptions explicitly recorded with reason — no silent denominator manipulation.
16. **Money rounding:** INR amounts rounded to paise using banker's rounding (`VAL-CURRENCY`); differences ≤ ₹0.01 absorbed by the budget line owner and logged.
17. **Service-bond integrity (`VAL-PS07-BOND`):** a `training_sponsorships` with `obligation_status=BREACHED` must produce a `BOND_RECOVERY` cost feeding PS10 before it can move to RECOVERED.
18. **One primary LRS (`VAL-PS07-PRIMARYLRS`):** exactly one `learning_record_stores` row may have `is_primary=true`.

### FR-PS07-001 — Skill Taxonomy & Competency Framework Management
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (`ld_officer`, maker), L&D Manager/SysAdmin (publish/approve), Auditor (read)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to define and publish a governed skill taxonomy and competency catalog so that all downstream processes use a single controlled vocabulary.
- **Description:** CRUD for `skill_categories`, `skills`, `competencies`, `proficiency_levels` with a DRAFT→PUBLISHED→ARCHIVED lifecycle. **Publication runs as a configured P01 master-data approval flow (W.1).** Compliance skills carry a default validity. Non-compliance skills may carry `revalidation_interval_months`; proficiency levels require a concrete behavioural `descriptor` (`VAL-PS07-ANCHOR`).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An L&D Officer can create categories, skills, competencies, and proficiency levels in DRAFT (W.2 forms).
  2. Publication of any master record starts a **P01 instance** (`WorkflowEngine.startInstance`) routed to L&D Manager; PUBLISHED on approval.
  3. PUBLISHED records cannot have their `code` changed; only ARCHIVE or new version.
  4. A skill flagged `is_compliance_skill=true` must have `default_validity_months` set.
  5. Archiving a category is blocked if it has PUBLISHED child skills (`CONFLICT` 409, `ERR-PRECOND`).
  6. A proficiency level cannot be PUBLISHED without a non-empty `descriptor` (`VAL-PS07-ANCHOR`, 422 `VALIDATION_FAILED`).
  7. A non-compliance skill may set `revalidation_interval_months`; if set it must be ≥ 1 (`VAL-PS07-REVAL`).
- **Business Rules:** `code` is `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE` per entity and immutable once PUBLISHED. Proficiency levels globally ordered, each with a behavioural anchor. A competency composes 0..N skills; deleting a skill referenced by a PUBLISHED competency is blocked.
- **Data Model References:** `skill_categories`/`skills`/`competencies`/`proficiency_levels` (C/R/U/Archive); **P05 audit (trigger)**, **P01 workflow_instances** (write via service).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/skills`, `/api/v1/competencies`, `/api/v1/skill-categories`, `/api/v1/proficiency-levels` |
  | PATCH | `/api/v1/skills/{id}` (incl. `:publish` → P01, `:archive`) |
  | GET | `/api/v1/skills?categoryId=&status=&cursor=&limit=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Tree view; competency builder with skill multi-select; publish routes to the P01 checker queue; status badges; inline validation for compliance validity and mandatory descriptor (helper text). Implements the five canonical UI states (Foundation §3).
- **Edge Cases:** Duplicate `code` (409 `CONFLICT`/`ERR-DUP-INSTANCE` semantics); archiving in-use master (409 `ERR-PRECOND`); reordering referenced levels (allowed, warns, recomputes gaps lazily); publishing a level without descriptor (422 `VALIDATION_FAILED`).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `TaxonomyController`, `CompetencyService`, `MasterDataPublisher`, **`P01WorkflowClient`** |
  | Backend Flow | Validate (descriptor, revalidation) → persist DRAFT → on publish `startInstance(workflow_code=PS07_MASTER_PUBLISH)` → on approve set PUBLISHED (P05 trigger audits) |
  | Validation | `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE` code; compliance validity; `VAL-PS07-ANCHOR`; contiguous level order |
  | Authorization | P02: `ld_officer` create/update; `ld_manager`/SysAdmin publish; global master scope |
  | State Changes | DRAFT→PUBLISHED→ARCHIVED; publish notifies subscribers (X.2); gap caches invalidated |
  | Failure Handling | 409 duplicate/in-use; 422 missing validity/descriptor; rollback on P01 failure |
  | Dependencies | P01, P05, X.2 |
  | Test Guidance | Code immutability; level ordering; descriptor enforcement; P01 publish flow |

### FR-PS07-002 — Role-Based Competency Models, Proficiency Targets & Governance
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (maker), L&D Manager (approve), model `owner_id` (steward)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want versioned competency models mapped to designations/cadres/**roles**/org-units with target proficiencies, an owner, and a review cadence, so gaps are measured objectively and the framework does not silently rot.
- **Description:** Create `competency_models` + `competency_model_items` scoped by designation/**role (`role_id`)**/cadre/org-unit/generic, with effective-dating (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`), versioning, `owner_id`, `review_due_date`. Staleness alarm via **JOB-PS07-MODELREVIEW**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A model scopes to designation, **role (`role_id`)**, cadre, org-unit, or generic; exactly one scope key matches `scope_type` (`VAL-PS07-SCOPEKEY`).
  2. Each item references a PUBLISHED competency and a valid proficiency target.
  3. Publishing a new version supersedes the prior for the same scope on `effective_from` (P01 in-flight version pinning applies to any approval flow).
  4. An employee resolves to exactly one effective model (most specific scope wins).
  5. Every model has `owner_id` + `review_due_date`; a model past review-due is flagged STALE by **JOB-PS07-MODELREVIEW** and notified via X.2 (`MSG-PS07-MODEL-REVIEW`).
  6. Computing a FINALIZED gap against a model past `review_due_date` is allowed but warns and stamps `model_stale_flag=true`.
- **Business Rules:** Effective periods for the same scope+version cannot overlap. Scope precedence DESIGNATION > ROLE > CADRE > ORG_UNIT > GENERIC. Weights drive WEIGHTED scoring only when `ld.gap-weighted` is granted. `review_due_date` defaults to `effective_from + 12 months`.
- **Data Model References:** `competency_models` (`role_id`,`owner_id`,`review_due_date`) C/R/U/Version; `competency_model_items` C/R/U/D; `competencies`/`proficiency_levels`/`roles` R.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/competency-models`, `/api/v1/competency-models/{id}/items`, `/api/v1/competency-models/{id}:publish` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/effective-competency-model` |

### FR-PS07-003 — Employee Skill Inventory, Assessment & Freshness
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (self-assess), Reporting Manager (validate), L&D Officer, Kiosk Operator (assisted)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to declare/maintain skills with proficiency, have my manager validate them, and have stale skills flagged, so my profile stays trusted.
- **Description:** Maintain `employee_skills` (one current row per skill) with history in `skill_assessments`. Validation DECLARED→VALIDATED. `last_validated_at` + `freshness_status` track decay, recomputed by **JOB-PS07-FRESHNESS**. Assisted capture for non-login staff via FR-PS07-022. Employee references resolve against the **PS01 `employees` master**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An employee (or Kiosk Operator on their behalf, attributed) can add/update a skill (status DECLARED).
  2. A manager can validate/adjust proficiency (VALIDATED, records validator + timestamp, sets `last_validated_at`).
  3. Every change appends an immutable `skill_assessments` row (P05 also captures the mutation).
  4. A skill acquired via a PUBLISHED certificate auto-populates source=CERTIFICATION with `expires_on` from cert validity.
  5. Skills past `expires_on` auto-transition to EXPIRED via **JOB-PS07-FRESHNESS**.
  6. A VALIDATED non-compliance skill whose `last_validated_at` exceeds `revalidation_interval_months` is set STALE nightly and surfaced for re-validation (X.2 `MSG-PS07-SKILL-STALE`).
  7. Self-assessment UI shows the proficiency-level behavioural anchor inline.
- **Business Rules:** `UNIQUE(tenant,employee,skill)`; updates overwrite the current row. Only the manager-of-record or L&D may VALIDATE (self-validation forbidden, 403 via P02). STALE does not change `status` but is discounted in gap closure (FR-004).
- **Data Model References:** `employee_skills` C/R/U; `skill_assessments` Append; `documents`(PS13)/`employees`(PS01)/`skills`/`proficiency_levels` R.

### FR-PS07-004 — Incremental Skill-Gap Analysis (Model + Appraisal Reconciliation)
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer, Reporting Manager, Employee (own)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want gaps computed incrementally against the effective model and reconciled with **PS08** appraisal development gaps, so needs are evidence-based and the engine scales to 200k employees.
- **Description:** Generate `skill_gap_analyses` + `skill_gap_items` comparing model targets to **fresh, validated** skills, merging **PS08** development gaps (source=APPRAISAL, via the pinned X.3 feed) and statutory mandates (source=MANDATORY). Default `scoring_mode=BINARY`; WEIGHTED only when `ld.gap-weighted`. Recompute is event-driven; full **JOB-PS07-GAPRECOMPUTE** batch is a fallback. Emits the Gap Contract (FR-PS07-024) for PS06/PS08.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Resolves the effective model and computes `gap_size = max(0, target − current)` per competency.
  2. **PS08** development gaps for the latest cycle are imported and merged (no duplicates by competency).
  3. Mandatory/compliance competencies the employee lacks appear as MANDATORY-source gaps regardless of model.
  4. Finalizing supersedes the prior FINALIZED analysis.
  5. Each gap item one-click converts to a `training_need` (1:1 source mapping).
  6. Only VALIDATED **and FRESH** skills close a gap; STALE skills discounted per configurable policy and counted in `stale_skill_count`; item flags `discounted_for_staleness`.
  7. Computing against a model past `review_due_date` stamps `model_stale_flag=true` and warns.
  8. At launch `scoring_mode=BINARY`; `overall_gap_score` null unless `ld.gap-weighted` granted.
  9. A skill-change event recomputes only the affected employee within the incremental SLA (§9), not a full batch.
- **Business Rules:** Critical gap = `is_critical` competency with `gap_size ≥ 1`. If the **PS08** feed is unavailable, analysis proceeds with model+mandate sources, flags `appraisal_cycle_ref=UNAVAILABLE` (graceful degradation; X.3 circuit-break). Staleness discount policy configurable: EXCLUDE or DISCOUNT_ONE_LEVEL.
- **Data Model References:** `skill_gap_analyses`/`skill_gap_items` C/R; `competency_models`/`employee_skills`/`proficiency_levels` R; **PS08 appraisal-gap feed (pinned contract §10.6, X.3)** R.
- **API References:**

  | GET | `/api/v1/gap-contract/v1?employeeId=&modelId=` (FR-PS07-024) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Radar/heatmap; gap list sortable by criticality; convert-to-need buttons; source legend; stale-discount/model-stale banners; manager team-rollup.
- **Edge Cases:** No effective model (GENERIC, warns); PS08 down (degraded mode, not surfaced as failure); employee above target (gap 0, surplus highlighted for marketplace FR-014); all current skills STALE → gaps reopen.

### FR-PS07-005 — Training Needs Identification & Consolidation
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Reporting Manager, L&D Officer, L&D Manager (prioritise)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to capture, consolidate, and prioritise needs from gaps, appraisals, mandates, and manager input so the annual plan is demand-driven.
- **Description:** Manage `training_needs` from multiple sources (1:1 with gap-item sources), deduplicate, prioritise, and roll up by org-unit/competency. Capture screens are **W.2 forms**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Needs can be created from a gap item, appraisal gap, mandate, manager input, self request, or induction.
  2. Duplicate needs (same employee+competency, same FY) are surfaced and prevented.
  3. L&D can consolidate individual needs into a group need with a participant list.
  4. Needs carry priority and FY and flow IDENTIFIED→CONSOLIDATED→PLANNED.
  5. A gap item converts to a need with `source` mapped 1:1.
- **Business Rules:** Mandatory-source needs cannot be REJECTED, only DEFERRED with justification (`VAL-COMMENT`). Group needs reference an org_unit. Priority derived-suggested (CRITICAL from critical gap/mandate) but L&D may override with reason.
- **Data Model References:** `training_needs` C/R/U; `skill_gap_items` R; `org_units`/`competencies` R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/training-needs`; GET `/api/v1/training-needs?fy=&orgUnitId=&priority=&status=&cursor=`; POST `/api/v1/training-needs:consolidate`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Needs inbox with source filters; consolidation wizard; priority editor; duplicate warning banner.
- **Edge Cases:** Same need from gap and mandate (merged, MANDATORY wins); consolidating across org-units (blocked, scope mismatch); deferring a critical mandatory need requires manager+L&D dual sign-off (P01).

### FR-PS07-006 — Annual Training Calendar, Plan & Budget Allocation
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (build), L&D Manager (approve), Dept Head/Finance (sanction)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Manager, I want to build and approve an annual plan and calendar with budget allocation per entity/org-unit so delivery is governed and funded.
- **Description:** Compose `annual_training_plans` + `training_plan_items` from consolidated needs, allocate `training_budgets` on the **canonical (FY, entity/org_unit) key** (`VAL-PS07-BUDGETKEY`), publish a quarter-bucketed calendar. **Plan submit/approve/sanction is a configured P01 multi-stage approval flow.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A plan pulls consolidated needs and proposes items with target audience, man-days, budget.
  2. Plan total budget reconciles to allocated `training_budgets` for the FY/entity/org-unit (category/competency reporting-only).
  3. Approval requires L&D Manager (P01); budget sanction requires Finance/Dept Head per policy (P01 stage).
  4. Once APPROVED→ACTIVE, sessions can be scheduled against plan items.
  5. A read-only annual calendar aggregates sessions by quarter and org-unit.
- **Business Rules:** `UNIQUE(tenant, financial_year, org_unit_id)` per plan. `Σ planned_budget ≤ allocated` at the canonical grain (overrun requires explicit approval flag → extra P01 stage). Closing a plan requires all items COMPLETED or DROPPED.
- **Data Model References:** `annual_training_plans`/`training_plan_items` C/R/U; `training_budgets` C/R/U; `training_needs` R/U (→PLANNED).
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/annual-training-plans`, `/{id}/items`, `/{id}:submit`/`:approve`; GET `/api/v1/training-calendar?fy=&orgUnitId=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Plan builder; budget reconciliation bar (allocated vs planned at canonical grain); quarter calendar; **P01 approval stepper**; category/competency as reporting-only chips.
- **Edge Cases:** Plan exceeds budget (block unless overrun flag + dual P01 approval); needs added after approval (amendment flow, version note); FY rollover copies recurring mandatory programs and seeds campaigns (FR-017).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |

### FR-PS07-007 — Course Catalog & Training Program Management
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (maker), L&D Manager (publish via P01)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want a catalog of programs (internal, external, e-learning, blended, micro-learning) with outcomes, certification rules, and cost so sessions, campaigns, and paths can be built from reusable programs.
- **Description:** CRUD `training_programs` with delivery mode, provider type, mandatory/induction flags, linked competencies, CPD credits, certification-on-completion + validity, default cost/capacity, materials, and LMS course reference. E-learning programs reference an `lms_content_packages` version and a `learning_record_stores` (X.3) connector.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A program defines delivery mode, provider type, duration, outcome competencies.
  2. Mandatory programs must link ≥1 compliance competency.
  3. `certification_on_completion=true` requires `cert_validity_months` (NULL = lifetime only if explicit).
  4. E-learning programs require a PUBLISHED content package and a designated **X.3 LRS/LMS connector** + standard.
  5. Retiring a program is blocked if it has OPEN/RUNNING sessions or an active campaign.
- **Business Rules:** `code` `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`, immutable once PUBLISHED. CPD ≥ 0; default cost ≥ 0. Linked competencies must be PUBLISHED.
- **Data Model References:** `training_programs` C/R/U/Retire; `lms_content_packages` R; `competencies`/`documents`(PS13) R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/training-programs`; GET `/api/v1/training-programs?mode=&provider=&mandatory=&q=&cursor=`; PATCH `/api/v1/training-programs/{id}` (`:publish`,`:retire`).
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Catalog grid/cards; program editor with outcome competency picker, materials upload (PS13), content-package + X.3 connector picker; mandatory/induction toggles.
- **Edge Cases:** E-learning without content package (422); retire with active sessions/campaign (409); duplicate code (409).

### FR-PS07-008 — Session/Batch Scheduling, Trainer & Venue Management
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer, Trainer (view)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to schedule sessions/batches and manage trainers/venues with capacity so delivery is logistically sound and conflict-free.
- **Description:** CRUD `training_sessions`, `trainers`, `venues` with conflict detection. External trainers link to an EMPANELLED `vendor_empanelments` record (FR-PS07-019, `VAL-PS07-EMPANEL`).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A session links a PUBLISHED program; sets capacity, dates, mode, nomination deadline.
  2. Prevents scheduling a trainer/venue with an overlapping confirmed session.
  3. `end_date ≥ start_date`, `nomination_deadline ≤ start_date` (`VAL-DATE`).
  4. Online sessions require a meeting URL; classroom require a venue with sufficient capacity.
  5. Cancelling cascades **X.2 notifications** and frees nominations to WITHDRAWN/re-nominate.
  6. Assigning an external trainer requires a valid EMPANELLED vendor for the session dates.
- **Business Rules:** `batch_code` unique. Venue capacity ≥ session capacity for PHYSICAL. Trainer expertise mismatch is a warning surfaced for L&D judgement, never auto-blocking.
- **Data Model References:** `training_sessions` C/R/U/Cancel; `trainers`/`venues` C/R/U; `vendor_empanelments` R; `training_programs` R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/training-sessions`; GET `/api/v1/training-sessions?programId=&status=&from=&to=&cursor=`; POST `/api/v1/training-sessions/{id}:cancel`; POST `/api/v1/trainers`,`/api/v1/venues`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Scheduling calendar with drag-to-create; conflict warnings; capacity meter; trainer/venue pickers with availability + empanelment status; cancel dialog requiring reason (`VAL-COMMENT`).
- **Edge Cases:** Double-booking (409 `ERR-PS07-SCHEDULE`); over-capacity venue (422); cancel a RUNNING session (allowed with reason, attendance preserved); external trainer not empanelled/expired (409 `ERR-PS07-EMPANEL`).

### FR-PS07-009 — Nomination & Multi-Level Approval Workflow (on P01)
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (self), Reporting Manager (L1), L&D Manager (L2), L&D Officer
- **User Story:** As a manager, I want to nominate employees (or approve self-nominations) through a **P01 maker-checker workflow** with budget checks and auditable capacity/waitlist handling so enrolment is controlled, funded, and fair.
- **Description:** Create `training_nominations` linked to a session and (ideally) a `training_need`, routed through the **P01 WorkflowEngine** (`startInstance` → L1/L2 `approve`), with budget commitment, capacity enforcement, and **persisted FIFO `waitlist_position` with P05-audited promotion**. Campaign-created nominations carry `training_campaign_id`/`nomination_type=CAMPAIGN`. The nomination form is a **W.2 form**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An employee can self-nominate; a manager can nominate reports; L&D/HR can nominate anyone in scope.
  2. **P01 routes** PENDING_L1→PENDING_L2→APPROVED; mandatory/induction/campaign may auto-approve per the configured flow (CONDITIONAL pattern, Appendix D).
  3. On APPROVED, capacity is decremented (atomic transaction); if full, nomination becomes WAITLISTED with persisted `waitlist_position`.
  4. Approval commits estimated cost to the canonical budget (FR-016); insufficient budget blocks approval unless overrun-approved.
  5. Withdrawal before deadline frees a seat and promotes the next waitlisted nomination by FIFO.
  6. Every waitlist promotion is captured by the **P05 trigger** (who/when/from-position); `waitlist_position` recomputed and persisted.
- **Business Rules:** `nominated_by ≠ approver` at each level (SoD via P01/P02). `UNIQUE(session, employee)`. Mandatory/campaign nominations cannot be self-withdrawn; only L&D with reason → `ERR-PS07-MANDATORY`. Waitlist promotion FIFO by `waitlist_position`. Idempotency: nomination/approve POSTs carry `Idempotency-Key`; a repeat returns the original (P01 `startInstance` is idempotent → 409 `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE` on duplicate start).
- **Data Model References:** `training_nominations` (`waitlist_position`,`training_campaign_id`,`workflow_instance_id`) C/R/U; `training_sessions` R/U (counts); **`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions` (P01)** C/U; `training_budgets` R/U (commit).

  | POST | `/api/v1/nominations/{id}:approve` / `:reject` / `:withdraw` (→ P01 advance) |
  | GET | `/api/v1/nominations?employeeId=&status=&sessionId=&cursor=` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/training-sessions/{id}/waitlist` (ordered by position) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Nominate dialog with need linkage and cost preview; approver task inbox surfaced via the **P01 Tasks aggregation** in the correct workspace; capacity/waitlist indicator; budget-impact banner; SoD prevents self-approve (button hidden per P02).
- **Edge Cases:** Approve when full (auto-waitlist, position assigned); budget exhausted (409 `ERR-PS07-BUDGET`); employee on leave/transferred mid-flow (flag, allow L&D decision); duplicate nomination (409 `CONFLICT`); concurrent withdrawals (atomic position recompute).

### FR-PS07-010 — Attendance Capture (incl. Proxy/Kiosk/Offline)
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Trainer, L&D Officer, Kiosk Operator
- **User Story:** As a trainer, I want to mark per-day attendance — including for non-login field staff via kiosk/offline capture — so completion and certification are accurate for the whole workforce.
- **Description:** Capture `training_attendance` per nomination per session-day with de-polymorphised `marked_by_actor_type`/`actor_id` and a `capture_mode`. Offline captures buffer on-device and sync via a batch (FR-PS07-022).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Trainer/L&D/Kiosk Operator can mark attendance for each APPROVED nomination per session day.
  2. One record per nomination per day (`UNIQUE`).
  3. Attendance below the program's minimum threshold marks the nomination ineligible for certification.
  4. A fully-absent nomination is auto-marked NO_SHOW at session completion (JOB-PS07 close logic).
  5. For e-learning, attendance derives from LMS/LRS progress (FR-PS07-015, `capture_mode=LMS_DERIVED`).
  6. Offline-captured attendance carries `offline_captured_at` + `offline_sync_batch_id`; on sync, server-side dedupe/reconcile applies; conflicts surfaced for L&D.
  7. Every record records the operator via `actor_type`/`actor_id` (no polymorphic ambiguity).
- **Business Rules:** Attendance markable only for RUNNING/COMPLETED sessions. Minimum % (default 80) configurable per program. EXCUSED excluded from denominator. Kiosk/assisted captures require an authenticated Kiosk Operator principal, fully attributed in **P05**.
- **Data Model References:** `training_attendance` (`marked_by_actor_*`,`capture_mode`,offline) C/R/U; `training_nominations` R/U; `documents`(PS13) R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/attendance` (bulk per day); GET `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/attendance?date=`; PATCH `/api/v1/attendance/{id}`; POST `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/attendance:offline-sync` (Idempotency-Key).
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Roster grid with day columns; bulk "mark all present"; signed-sheet upload (PS13); attendance-% summary; **kiosk mode UI and functional offline state with pending-sync count** (Foundation §3 offline state); locked once COMPLETED (correction via L&D with audit).
- **Edge Cases:** Marking for non-approved nomination (403); duplicate day mark (409 upsert); session spanning weekends/holidays (only configured training days counted); offline batch with stale device clock (server reconciles, flags skew).

### FR-PS07-011 — Assessment (Pre/Post) & Kirkpatrick Evaluation
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Trainer, L&D Officer, Employee (feedback)
- **User Story:** As a trainer, I want to record pre/post scores and collect Kirkpatrick feedback at the right level so learning effectiveness and impact are measurable without features that ship empty.
- **Description:** Append-only `training_assessments` (PRE/POST/REASSESSMENT, de-polymorphised assessor) and `training_feedback`. L1/L2 per-participant; **L3 (behaviour) and L4 (results) are optional, sampled, programme-level**; L4 links named **PS14** business-KPI keys. Feedback forms are **W.2 forms**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Pre/post assessments recorded per nomination; POST result drives completion PASS/FAIL.
  2. Learning gain = POST − PRE computed and reportable.
  3. Participants submit L1/L2 feedback (anonymous-capable; PII stripped).
  4. Trainer `avg_feedback_rating` derived from L1 ratings (**JOB-PS07-TRAINERRATE**).
  5. A nomination with POST=FAIL is ineligible for certification (re-assessment allowed).
  6. L3/L4 captured at programme level on a sample; UI never blocks completion on missing L3/L4.
  7. L4 `responses_json` references named **PS14** business-KPI keys for cost-per-outcome.

### FR-PS07-012 — Certification, Enforced Validity & Renewal; Mandatory Compliance
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (issue), L&D Manager (approve revoke via P01)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to issue certificates with validity **enforced** — not merely notified — with automatic renewal so statutory obligations are continuously met and lapses are actionable.
- **Description:** Issue `certifications` on completion, generate certificate numbers and PDFs (**PS13**), track `valid_until` and renewal, auto-expire via **JOB-PS07-CERTEXPIRY**, support revocation (**P01 flow**), and produce a mandatory-compliance currency view. On mandatory-cert expiry the system auto-creates a renewal need + campaign re-nomination and sets `lapsed_mandatory=true` (consumed by **PS06**).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A certificate issues only when the nomination is COMPLETED with attendance threshold met and POST=PASS (where applicable).
  2. `certificate_no` is unique and immutable; PDF generated and stored via **PS13**.
  3. Certificates past `valid_until` auto-transition to EXPIRED via **JOB-PS07-CERTEXPIRY** and notify (X.2 `MSG-PS07-CERT-EXPIRY`).
  4. Renewal reminders fire at configurable lead times (60/30/7 days) via X.2.
  5. A mandatory-compliance dashboard shows required vs held vs lapsed certs.
  6. On EXPIRED of a mandatory cert, the system auto-creates a renewal `training_need` (`renewal_need_id`) and enrolls into the relevant rolling campaign (FR-PS07-017).
  7. `lapsed_mandatory=true` set on expiry and exposed via API for **PS06** to block sensitive duty/posting.
  8. Lapse cleared only when a fresh valid mandatory cert is issued (SUPERSEDED chain).
- **Business Rules:** Revocation runs a **P01 flow** (L&D Manager approval + reason); sets REVOKED and, if posted, flags a PS12 SR correction. Issuing a renewable cert updates linked `employee_skill.expires_on`/`last_validated_at`. Significant/mandatory certs trigger **PS12 SR posting** (FR-PS07-016) with `sr_posting_status=PENDING`.
- **Data Model References:** `certifications` (`lapsed_mandatory`,`renewal_need_id`,`service_register_event_id`) C/R/U; `documents`(PS13) C (PDF); `employee_skills` U; `training_needs` C; **`service_register_events`(PS12)** via FR-016.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/nominations/{id}:issue-certificate`; GET `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/certifications`; POST `/api/v1/certifications/{id}:revoke` (→P01); GET `/api/v1/compliance/mandatory-status?orgUnitId=`, `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/lapsed-mandatory` (PS06 consumer).
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Certificate issue action with eligibility check; viewer/download; expiry timeline; renewal banners; compliance heatmap; lapsed-mandatory badge and auto-renewal status.
- **Edge Cases:** Issue when ineligible (409 `ERR-PS07-CERT-INELIGIBLE`); duplicate issue (409); revoke a posted cert (P01 + PS12 SR correction); lifetime cert (`valid_until` NULL); expiry with no active renewal program/campaign (escalates to L&D).

### FR-PS07-013 — Induction / Onboarding Training Program
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer, HR Officer, Reporting Manager
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want new entrants auto-enrolled into a structured induction program with tracked completion so onboarding is consistent and compliant.
- **Description:** On a new-joiner event from **PS01** (**pinned joiner contract §10.6**, consumed via the platform service/X.3 pattern), auto-create induction needs and nominations into the configured induction program/path, track completion within an onboarding window, and escalate non-completion via **JOB-PS07-INDUCTION** + X.2.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A new-joiner event (PS01 `date_of_joining`) triggers auto-nomination into the active induction program(s).
  2. Completion tracked against an onboarding window (30/60/90 days).
  3. Non-completion escalates to manager and L&D (X.2 `MSG-PS07-INDUCTION-OVERDUE`).
  4. Induction modules can be classroom, e-learning, or blended and reuse FR-PS07-007 programs.
  5. Induction completion contributes to mandatory-compliance status (FR-PS07-012).
  6. The joiner event conforms to the pinned PS01 contract; missing/late events are reconciled idempotently (Idempotency-Key on the event).
- **Business Rules:** Induction nominations are type=INDUCTION, may auto-approve per the P01 flow. Program/path configurable per cadre/designation. Missing induction is a surfaced compliance exception.
- **Data Model References:** `training_needs`(source=INDUCTION) C; `training_nominations`(type=INDUCTION) C; `learning_paths` R; **PS01 joiner event (pinned)** R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/induction:enroll` (event-driven + manual); GET `/api/v1/induction/status?orgUnitId=&cursor=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Onboarding tracker per joiner with module checklist; manager team view; overdue flags; configurable induction template editor.
- **Edge Cases:** Late joiner sync (back-dated window); transfer during induction (follows employee); re-induction on re-employment.

### FR-PS07-014 — Learning Paths, Recommendations, CPD & Skills Marketplace (Phase 2)
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (curate), Employee (consume), Reporting Manager
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want learning paths, skill-based recommendations, CPD tracking, and a skills marketplace so I can grow toward my role and aspirations.
- **Description:** Curate `learning_paths` + items; generate gap-driven recommendations; track `cpd_records`; expose a skills marketplace. The **recommendation engine and marketplace are gated by capability flags `ld.recommendations`/`ld.marketplace` (RBAC §4.3)**; CPD tracking ships at launch; CPD targets and curated paths phased per §2.5.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. L&D can curate published paths; the recommendation engine (when `ld.recommendations` granted) generates suggested paths from gaps.
  2. An employee sees ranked recommendations mapped to critical gaps (when flag granted).
  3. Completing a program awards CPD credits, appended to `cpd_records`.
  4. CPD totals aggregated per credit year; CPD **targets** only when `ld.cpd-targets` granted.
  5. The skills marketplace (when `ld.marketplace` granted) lists surplus-proficiency employees as mentors/SMEs, **opt-in only** (`VAL-CONSENT`).
  6. With developmental flags OFF, screens show curated paths + CPD tracking and mark recommendation/marketplace "coming in Phase 2", never broken/empty controls.
- **Business Rules:** Recommendations prioritise CRITICAL > HIGH gaps and mandates. CPD append-only, credits ≥ 0. Marketplace opt-in (`consent_records`) and DPDP-respecting; opt-out hides the employee (FR-PS07-023 erases presence on exit).
- **Data Model References:** `learning_paths`/`learning_path_items` C/R/U; `cpd_records` Append; `skill_gap_items`/`employee_skills` R; `consent_records`(platform) R.
- **API References:** GET `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/recommendations` (flagged); POST `/api/v1/learning-paths`; GET `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/cpd?year=`; GET `/api/v1/marketplace/skills?skillId=` (flagged).
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Path explorer with progress rings; recommendation cards (flagged); CPD dashboard; marketplace directory with opt-in toggle (flagged); Phase-2 capabilities badged when off.
- **Edge Cases:** No gaps (growth/aspiration paths); CPD double-count guarded by `source_ref`; marketplace opt-out hides employee.

### FR-PS07-015 — LMS/LRS Integration (SCORM Poll / xAPI LRS) on the X.3 Framework
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** SysAdmin (config), L&D Officer, Employee (learner)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want e-learning enrolments to sync progress/completion from the LMS via a technically correct mechanism (xAPI LRS or SCORM reporting-API poll) **running on the platform X.3 integration framework** so online learning is tracked without manual entry and without a non-existent SCORM webhook.
- **Description:** Integration runs on **X.3** (call/credential/retry pattern, circuit-breaking, outbound idempotency, payload versioning, per-integration error mapping); credentials come from **P04 `integration_credentials`** (referenced by `learning_record_stores.integration_credential_ref`, never stored in the PS07 table). SCORM has no server-to-server push:
  - **xAPI:** content emits statements to an **LRS** (`connector_type=LRS_XAPI`); PS07 ingests via X.3 (idempotent by `lms_statement_id`).
  - **SCORM:** **JOB-PS07-LMSSYNC** polls the LMS reporting API (`LMS_REPORTING_API`, `SCORM_POLL`) on `poll_interval_minutes`, advancing `last_poll_cursor`. **No webhook push.**
  - **Self-hosted SCORM:** an in-platform content player consumes the client-side run-time and writes progress server-side.
  - **Single-vs-multi-LMS:** exactly one `is_primary` connector is the system of record (`VAL-PS07-PRIMARYLRS`).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Approving a nomination for an e-learning program provisions an `lms_enrollment` bound to a `learning_record_stores` (X.3) connector and (if self-hosted) a content-package version.
  2. Learners launch via SSO deep-link; no separate LMS login.
  3. For xAPI, completion/progress is ingested from the LRS via X.3; for SCORM, via **JOB-PS07-LMSSYNC** poll — not a push webhook.
  4. xAPI statements idempotent (repeated `lms_statement_id` ignored; X.3 outbound/inbound idempotency); SCORM polls idempotent by cursor + enrolment.
  5. Completion auto-derives attendance (`LMS_DERIVED`) and triggers certification eligibility.
  6. Persistent sync failure flags the enrolment for manual reconciliation; the **X.3 circuit-breaker** trips and connector health (sync lag, last cursor) is exposed.
- **Business Rules:** Supported standards SCORM 1.2/2004, xAPI; NONE for non-tracked. `progress_pct ∈ [0,100]`; COMPLETED requires progress ≥ criterion. **No integration path assumes a SCORM server push.** Secrets only via P04; never logged.
- **Data Model References:** `lms_enrollments` C/R/U; `learning_record_stores` R (connector); `lms_content_packages` R; `training_nominations` R/U; `training_attendance` C (derived); **`integration_credentials`(P04)** R via X.3.

### FR-PS07-016 — Service Register Posting (PS12, `is_significant` Rule Set) & Budget/Cost Tracking
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer/Manager, Finance/Budget Controller, SR Custodian (PS12, receive)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Manager, I want significant trainings/qualifications posted to the **PS12 Service Register ledger** using a pinned, auditable significance rule and full budget/cost tracking on a single canonical key so statutory records are complete and spend reconciles.
- **Description:** Post significant completions/certifications as append-only events to the **PS12 SR ledger (which runs on the P05 substrate)** via the **X.3 outbound pattern** (idempotent, circuit-broken, payload-versioned, **pinned event contract §10.6**), and maintain `training_budgets`/`training_costs` (planned→committed→actual) on the **canonical (FY, entity/org_unit) key** (`VAL-PS07-BUDGETKEY`), reimbursement/bond-recovery payable feed to **PS10**, cost-per-completion, and variance reporting. Significance resolved by an explicit `is_significant` rule set (`VAL-PS07-SIGNIF`).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. The `is_significant` rule set determines posting: significant if any of (a) mandatory certification, (b) externally accredited/professional credential (FR-PS07-018), (c) program duration ≥ threshold, (d) promotion-relevant flag (PS06), (e) sponsored degree/deputation (FR-PS07-020). Resolved decision + matched rule(s) stored and auditable (P05).
  2. Significant items post to **PS12** as append-only SR events conforming to the pinned contract (idempotent by source ref).
  3. Posting state tracked (NOT_REQUIRED/PENDING/POSTED/FAILED) with automatic **X.3 retry** on FAILED.
  4. Approved nominations commit cost to the relevant budget at the canonical key.
  5. Actual costs reduce remaining budget and reconcile to invoices (PS13).
  6. Reimbursement/bond-recovery costs flagged `payable_to_payroll` emit an approved-payable feed to **PS10**.
  7. Budget variance reportable per entity/org-unit/FY; category/competency reporting-only.
  8. `cost_per_completion` computed (actual ÷ completions) for ROI analytics (PS14, FR-PS07-011 L4).
- **Business Rules:** SR events append-only; corrections post a new corrective event (the PS12 ledger itself is immutable on the P05 substrate). `committed + actual ≤ allocated` at the canonical key unless overrun allowed (FROZEN blocks new commitment). Cost approver ≠ creator (SoD via P02); payable feed only for APPROVED costs.
- **Data Model References:** **`service_register_events`(PS12)** Append (via X.3); `certifications` U (`sr_posting_status`); `training_budgets` C/R/U; `training_costs` (`vendor_empanelment_id`,`training_sponsorship_id`) C/R/U.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** SR posting status chips with retry; budget dashboard (allocated/committed/actual at canonical key, variance %, cost-per-completion); significance rule-trace tooltip; cost entry with invoice upload (PS13); payable-to-payroll toggle; reconciliation view.
- **Edge Cases:** SR posting timeout (PENDING→X.3 retry→FAILED with alert `MSG-PS07-SR-FAILED`); double-post prevented by idempotency key; budget overrun (409 `ERR-PS07-BUDGET` unless override); FROZEN blocks commitment; banker's rounding INR; significance rule conflict (most-inclusive wins, logged).

### FR-PS07-017 — Mandatory-Compliance Campaign Engine *(Risk #2 Critical)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (run), L&D Manager (approve), Dept Head (sanction scope)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to launch a mandatory-training campaign that bulk-nominates an entire scope, auto-waves participants into capacity-bounded sessions, drives rolling annual renewal, and escalates non-completion so ~200k annual mandatory completions are achievable.
- **Description:** Create `training_campaigns` (approved via **P01**) and resolve `campaign_targets` honouring the coverage denominator rule (`VAL-PS07-COVERAGE`). Bulk-create nominations (`nomination_type=CAMPAIGN`) and auto-wave into sessions; run rolling-renewal and escalation via **JOB-PS07-CAMPAIGN** on X.1 (notifications via X.2). Reaches non-login staff via FR-PS07-022.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A campaign resolves its target population from scope + denominator rule, marking ineligible targets EXEMPT with reason.
  2. `:enroll-batch` bulk-creates nominations for all eligible targets idempotently (Idempotency-Key; re-running does not duplicate; runs as a resumable X.1 job).
  3. `auto_wave=true` assigns targets to waves and capacity-bounded sessions, creating sessions when capacity is exceeded.
  4. A rolling-renewal scheduler (JOB-PS07-CAMPAIGN) re-targets employees `renewal_cadence_months` before cert expiry (ties FR-PS07-012).
  5. Escalation fires per `escalation_policy_json` to employee→manager→L&D via X.2; `escalation_level` increments.
  6. A campaign dashboard shows coverage % (vs eligible denominator), per-wave progress, overdue list, exemptions.
  7. Completion of a target updates `target_status` and feeds mandatory-compliance status (FR-PS07-012).
- **Business Rules:** Bulk nomination respects per-session capacity and budget (FR-009/016); over-capacity spills to new waves, never breaks the capacity invariant. Campaign nominations cannot be self-withdrawn (`ERR-PS07-MANDATORY`). Coverage % always uses the eligible denominator; exemptions explicit and audited. A campaign cannot RUN without an approved scope (P01) and a published mandatory program.
- **Data Model References:** `training_campaigns` C/R/U; `campaign_targets` C/R/U; `training_nominations`(CAMPAIGN) C; `training_sessions` C/R/U; `employees`/`org_units`(PS01) R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/training-campaigns`, `/{id}:approve` (P01), `/{id}:enroll-batch` (Idempotency-Key), `/{id}:auto-wave`; GET `/{id}/coverage?orgUnitId=`, `/{id}/overdue?cursor=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Campaign wizard (program, scope, window, renewal cadence, denominator rule, wave size, escalation); coverage dashboard (eligible/exempt/overdue); wave board; bulk-action confirmations with impact preview (target count, sessions to create, budget impact).
- **Edge Cases:** Scope changes mid-campaign (re-resolve, additive only, audited); employee transfers (target follows employee/org per policy); insufficient capacity org-wide (auto-create sessions or surface a scheduling gap); re-running enroll-batch (idempotent); employees on long leave (EXEMPT per denominator).

### FR-PS07-018 — External & Professional Credential Capture & Verification *(Risk #6)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (submit), L&D Officer (verify, `ld.credential-verify`), L&D Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to record externally-acquired professional credentials (PMP, CISA, a statutory licence) with evidence so my significant qualifications are recognised and posted to the PS12 service register regardless of who delivered the training.
- **Description:** Capture `certifications` with `credential_source=EXTERNAL_PROFESSIONAL`, `issuing_body`, `external_reference_no`, and verification recorded in the append-only `credential_verifications` ledger. Verified significant credentials are eligible for **PS12 SR posting** (FR-PS07-016) and can populate the skill inventory. Submission/verification screens are **W.2 forms**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An employee/L&D can create an external credential with issuing body, reference, dates, evidence (`VAL-FILE`→PS13).
  2. Verification routes through L&D: SUBMITTED→EVIDENCE_REVIEWED→VERIFIED/REJECTED, each appended to `credential_verifications`.
  3. A VERIFIED renewable credential sets `valid_until` and can update `employee_skills`.
  4. A VERIFIED credential meeting `is_significant` (FR-PS07-016) becomes PS12 SR-posting eligible.
  5. Self-capture creator ≠ verifier (SoD via P02).
  6. Rejected credentials retain the immutable verification trail; not deleted.
- **Business Rules:** External credentials need not link a `training_program_id`. Verification method recorded. Only VERIFIED credentials post to PS12. `external_reference_no` unique per employee (`VAL-PS07-CREDREF`).
- **Data Model References:** `certifications`(EXTERNAL_PROFESSIONAL) C/R/U; `credential_verifications` Append; `documents`(PS13) R; `employee_skills` U (optional).
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/external-credentials`, `/api/v1/external-credentials/{id}:verify`/`:reject`; GET `/api/v1/employees/{empId}/external-credentials`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Credential submission form; verification queue with evidence viewer; status badges; SR-eligibility indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Duplicate external reference for same employee (409 `VAL-PS07-CREDREF`); evidence missing on submit (422 if policy requires); verifier = submitter (403 SoD `ERR-FORBIDDEN`); credential expiry behaves like FR-PS07-012.

### FR-PS07-019 — Vendor / External-Trainer Empanelment & Procurement Linkage *(Risk #15)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Vendor/Empanelment Manager (`ld.vendor-admin`), L&D Manager (approve via P01), Finance
- **User Story:** As an L&D Manager, I want external trainers/providers empanelled with contract and procurement references so external costs tie to an approved vendor and public-sector procurement controls are honoured.
- **Description:** Maintain `vendor_empanelments` with status, contract/procurement references, validity, rate cards; link external `trainers` and `training_costs` to an empanelled vendor. **Empanelment approval is a configured P01 flow** (requester ≠ approver). Procurement-system linkage (if live) runs on **X.3**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A vendor empanelment captures name, empanelment ref, contract/procurement refs, validity, rate card.
  2. Empanelment requires approval (SoD via P01/P02); DRAFT→PENDING_APPROVAL→EMPANELLED.
  3. External trainers may link to an EMPANELLED vendor; sessions with external trainers require valid empanelment (FR-PS07-008).
  4. External `training_costs` must reference an EMPANELLED vendor within validity (`VAL-PS07-EMPANEL`).
  5. Suspended/blacklisted/expired vendors cannot be assigned to new sessions or costs.
- **Business Rules:** `empanelment_ref` `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE`. Validity must cover session/cost dates. Blacklisting cascades a block on new assignments (history preserved). Expiry handled by **JOB-PS07-EMPANELEXPIRE**.
- **Data Model References:** `vendor_empanelments` C/R/U; `trainers` R/U (link); `training_costs` R (linkage); `documents`(PS13) R (contract).
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/vendor-empanelments`, `/{id}:approve`/`:suspend`/`:blacklist`; GET `/api/v1/vendor-empanelments?status=&validOn=&cursor=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Empanelment register with status/validity; contract/procurement reference fields + document upload; rate-card editor; **P01 approval stepper**; block warnings on assigning non-empanelled vendors.
- **Edge Cases:** Cost referencing expired empanelment (409 `ERR-PS07-EMPANEL`); blacklisting a vendor with active sessions (block new, flag existing); duplicate ref (409); self-approval (403).

### FR-PS07-020 — Sponsorship / Study-Leave / Deputation & Service-Obligation *(Risk #15)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), Reporting Manager (recommend), Dept Head/Appointing Authority (sanction via P01), Finance (recovery)
- **User Story:** As an appointing authority, I want to sanction long-duration sponsored training with a service bond and track the obligation so public funds are recoverable on breach.
- **Description:** Model `training_sponsorships` with sponsored amount, service-bond duration, derived bond-end date, obligation status, and breach→recovery handling that feeds a `BOND_RECOVERY` cost to **PS10** (FR-PS07-016). **Sanction is a configured P01 recommend→sanction flow.** Breach detection ties to the **PS05** relieving event where applicable.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A sponsorship captures type, sponsored amount, dates, bond months, links a program or external course.
  2. Sanction routes recommend→sanction (Dept Head, P01); PROPOSED→SANCTIONED→ACTIVE.
  3. On completion the bond is ACTIVE until `bond_end_date`; fulfilling sets FULFILLED.
  4. Early exit/breach sets BREACHED and computes `bond_recovery_amount` (pro-rata per policy).
  5. A BREACHED bond must emit a `BOND_RECOVERY` cost (`payable_to_payroll`) before moving to RECOVERED (`VAL-PS07-BOND`).
  6. Waivers require authority approval (P01) and are audited (WAIVED, P05).
- **Business Rules:** `bond_end_date = completion_date + service_bond_months`. Recovery per configurable pro-rata formula. Bond recoveries route to PS10 via the payable feed.
- **Data Model References:** `training_sponsorships` C/R/U; `training_costs`(SPONSORSHIP, BOND_RECOVERY) C; `training_programs` R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/training-sponsorships`, `/{id}:sanction`/`:mark-breached`/`:waive`, `/{id}:compute-recovery`; GET `/api/v1/training-sponsorships?status=&employeeId=&cursor=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Sponsorship request form; **P01 approval stepper**; bond timeline; breach action with computed recovery preview; recovery-to-payroll status; waiver dialog with reason.
- **Edge Cases:** Resignation during bond (auto-flag BREACHED via PS05 relieving event, compute recovery); transfer within org (bond continues); waiver after partial recovery (audited); deceased/retired (policy-driven waiver).

### FR-PS07-021 — Content & Assessment-Item Management *(Risk #12, #16)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (author/curate), SysAdmin (host config), Auditor (read)
- **User Story:** As an L&D Officer, I want to author and version SCORM/xAPI content packages and assessment item banks with accessibility metadata so e-learning and tests are hosted, versioned, and WCAG-conformant.
- **Description:** Manage `lms_content_packages` (versioned SCORM/xAPI/self-hosted with `hosting` and `wcag_conformance`) and `assessment_items` (item bank with types, keys, versions, accessibility). Self-hosted binaries stored via **PS13**; correct keys masked on serialization (P02).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A content package is versioned per program with declared standard and hosting model.
  2. Packages/items carry `wcag_conformance`; NON_CONFORMANT content cannot be PUBLISHED for mandatory programs without an accessibility-exception approval (P01, `VAL-PS07-WCAG`).
  3. Assessment items support single/multi-choice, true/false, numeric, free-text, with versioning; correct keys RBAC-restricted (P02 field mask).
  4. Publishing a new version supersedes the prior for new enrolments; in-flight enrolments retain their launched version (mirrors P01 in-flight pinning).
  5. Content accessibility is testable and reported; assessment content meets WCAG 2.1 AA (§9).
- **Business Rules:** `UNIQUE(tenant, training_program_id, package_version)`. Correct keys never returned to learners. Self-hosted packages store the binary via PS13.
- **Data Model References:** `lms_content_packages` C/R/U/Retire; `assessment_items` C/R/U/Retire; `training_programs`/`documents`(PS13) R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/content-packages`, `/api/v1/assessment-items`; GET `/api/v1/programs/{id}/content-packages`; PATCH `/api/v1/content-packages/{id}` (`:publish`,`:retire`).
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Package manager with version history, standard, hosting, WCAG badge; item-bank editor with type-specific fields and accessibility checklist; key fields masked for non-authors (P02); accessibility-exception workflow (P01).
- **Edge Cases:** NON_CONFORMANT mandatory content (blocked without exception, 422 `ERR-PS07-WCAG`); duplicate version (409); retiring a package with active enrolments (in-flight retain version); leaking correct keys (forbidden by P02).

### FR-PS07-022 — Proxy / Kiosk / Assisted Mode & Offline Attendance Sync *(Risk #9)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Kiosk Operator (`ld_kiosk_operator`), Reporting Manager (proxy), L&D Officer
- **User Story:** As a Kiosk Operator, I want to launch e-learning, capture self-assessment, and record attendance on behalf of non-login field/clerical staff — including offline with later sync — so the whole workforce is reachable and compliance KPIs are attainable.
- **Description:** Provide an **attributed** assisted/kiosk mode for skill self-assessment, e-learning launch, and attendance capture for employees without an individual login, plus offline buffering and reconciliation. Defines the compliance-coverage denominator (`VAL-PS07-COVERAGE`) used by campaigns (FR-PS07-017). Employee selection resolves against the **PS01 master** by `service_no`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A Kiosk Operator authenticates (real platform principal) and selects an employee (by `service_no`); all actions attributed to both operator and employee in **P05**.
  2. Assisted self-assessment writes `employee_skills`/`skill_assessments` with source=SELF and operator attribution.
  3. Kiosk e-learning launch maps the employee to an `lms_user_ref` for X.3 sync (FR-PS07-015).
  4. Offline attendance buffers locally with `offline_captured_at` and syncs via `:offline-sync` (FR-PS07-010), deduped server-side.
  5. The coverage denominator classifies each employee eligible/exempt for campaign metrics; classification is auditable and policy-driven.
  6. Assisted/kiosk capture never bypasses SoD or validation rules of the underlying FR (P02 still enforces).
- **Business Rules:** Kiosk Operator is a real authenticated principal; **no anonymous capture**. Offline buffers encrypted and reconciled idempotently by (nomination, date). Denominator rules configurable per campaign.
- **Data Model References:** `training_attendance`(KIOSK/ASSISTED/OFFLINE_SYNC) C/R/U; `employee_skills`/`skill_assessments` C; `lms_enrollments` C; `campaign_targets` R/U (denominator).
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/kiosk/sessions`, `/api/v1/kiosk/{empId}/self-assessment`, `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/attendance:offline-sync`; GET `/api/v1/coverage/eligibility?campaignId=&employeeId=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Kiosk-optimised large-touch UI; employee selector by `service_no`; assisted forms with behavioural-anchor help; functional offline state with pending-sync count and conflict-resolution queue; operator attribution always visible.
- **Edge Cases:** Offline clock skew (server reconciles, flags); duplicate offline + online mark (dedupe, conflict surfaced); operator assisting outside org scope (403 via P02); unmapped employee with no `service_no` (denominator EXEMPT with reason).
- **LLD:**

### FR-PS07-023 — DPDP Retention & Erasure of Learning PII at Exit *(Risk #13)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** Data Protection Officer (approve/execute), L&D Officer, Auditor
- **User Story:** As the DPO, I want defined retention/erasure of learning PII when an employee exits so DPDP obligations are met while statutory SR-posted records are preserved.
- **Description:** On employee exit (from PS01 lifecycle: RETIRED/RESIGNED/TERMINATED/DECEASED) or a data-subject erasure request, apply configured retention/erasure actions, recording each append-only in `learning_data_retention_actions`. Statutory-retention overrides preserve SR-posted certs. **Audit-PII erasure executes through the P05 redaction-marker path** (the sole permitted audit mutation); statutory retention never falls below the statutory floor (Platform §8.1).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An exit/erasure event resolves a retention/erasure plan: anonymise self-assessments, detach feedback authorship, erase marketplace presence, retain statutory records.
  2. SR-posted certifications and statutory records flagged `retention_override=true` and preserved.
  3. Each action appended to `learning_data_retention_actions` with DPO approval; ledger immutable.
  4. Marketplace presence removed immediately on exit regardless of prior opt-in.
  5. An export action can produce a data-subject export before erasure where required.
  6. Erasure requester ≠ DPO approver (SoD via P02).
- **Business Rules:** Append-only ledger; no destructive action without DPO approval. Statutory retention always wins over erasure for SR-posted/legally-required records. PII minimisation in logs throughout (P05 stores masked PII).
- **Data Model References:** `learning_data_retention_actions` Append; `employee_skills`/`skill_assessments`/`training_feedback`/`certifications` U/anonymise; `consent_records`(platform) R.
- **API References:** POST `/api/v1/learning-data/retention-plan?employeeId=`, `/api/v1/learning-data/retention-actions:execute`, `/api/v1/learning-data/export?employeeId=`; GET `/api/v1/learning-data/retention-actions?employeeId=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** DPO console listing exit/erasure cases; per-action checklist with statutory-override flags; approval workflow (P01); immutable action history; export download.
- **Edge Cases:** SR-posted cert under erasure request (retained, documented to subject, 409 `ERR-PS07-RETENTION`); re-employment after erasure (new profile, no resurrection); deceased employee (next-of-kin/policy handling); partial erasure with statutory holds.

### FR-PS07-024 — Published Gap Contract for PS06 / PS08 *(Risk #3, launch-required primitive)*
- **Module:** PS07
- **Primary Role(s):** L&D Officer (publish), Integration/SysAdmin, Auditor
- **User Story:** As the owner of PS06/PS08 integration, I want a stable, versioned Gap Contract describing each employee's competency gaps so promotion (PS06) and appraisal (PS08) consume a guaranteed primitive even while the developmental layer is phased.
- **Description:** Project a versioned, read-only **Gap Contract v1** from `skill_gap_analyses` + `skill_gap_items`: per (employee, model) the list of competencies with a positive gap, each flagged critical/non-critical, with staleness/model-stale indicators. Served on the platform API conventions (cursor pagination for batch; `Authorization.check` row scoping). Payload versioning aligns with the **X.3 payload-versioning** discipline.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. The Gap Contract exposes: `employeeId`, `competencyModelId`, `generatedOn`, `scoringMode`, `modelStaleFlag`, and an array of `{competencyId, isCritical, gapSize, discountedForStaleness}`.
  2. Versioned (`v1`); changes backward-compatible or version-bumped, never silently altered.
  3. PS06 and PS08 read via a stable endpoint; the schema is registered in the dependency register (§10.6).
  4. Reflects the latest FINALIZED analysis; SUPERSEDED analyses not exposed.
  5. Binary critical/non-critical always present; weighted fields appear only when `ld.gap-weighted` granted; consumers not required to use them.
- **Business Rules:** Read-only, projection-only (no side effects). Versioning explicit. Row-level scoping applies to consumers (P02).
- **Data Model References:** `skill_gap_analyses`/`skill_gap_items` R (projection).
- **API References:** GET `/api/v1/gap-contract/v1?employeeId=&modelId=`; GET `/api/v1/gap-contract/v1/batch?orgUnitId=&fy=&cursor=&limit=`.
- **UI Behavior Notes:** No direct UI; an admin "contract schema & version" reference page and a consumer-access audit view (P05).
- **Edge Cases:** No FINALIZED analysis (empty contract with reason); consumer requests out-of-scope employee (403 via P02, never reveals existence); version negotiation via path.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `GapContractProjector`, `ContractVersionRegistry` |
  | Backend Flow | On FINALIZE (FR-004) → project contract → serve read-only to PS06/PS08 (service auth + P02 scope); version pinned |

  | State Changes | None (read-only) |
  | Failure Handling | Empty contract on no analysis; 403 out-of-scope |

## 7. UI Requirements

### 7.1 Global UI principles
- Behaviour/NFR specified here; the physical stack is an engineering choice within the platform's logical architecture. Responsive (breakpoints 375/768/1280px; touch ≥ 44×44px), WCAG 2.1 AA (keyboard nav, focus order, 4.5:1 contrast, ARIA), dark mode.
- Every screen implements the **five canonical UI states** (Foundation §3): **empty / loading / error (`ERR-*` id + retry, never a raw 500) / no-permission (gating item hidden; deep-linked forbidden shows `ERR-FORBIDDEN`, not a 404 leak) / partial-data (render authorised, mask the rest per RBAC)**. Offline state is **functional** for kiosk attendance (FR-PS07-022), not decorative.
- `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates, INR currency, locale-aware. Masked-field and `E·AR` request-change patterns per RBAC §3.9 / Platform §P02.
- All lists **cursor-paginated** (limit ≤ 100), filterable, sortable, with column-level RBAC field masking on serialization.
- Proficiency self-assessment and assessment content surface **behavioural anchors** and meet content-accessibility (FR-PS07-021/§9).
- Tasks/approvals surface through the **P01 Tasks aggregation** and the **Me / My Team / Admin** workspace model (Platform §6.5); each task routes to exactly one workspace.

## 10. API & Integration (platform conventions adopted)

### 10.1 Conventions (Foundation §1)
- Base path **`/api/v1`**; JWT bearer carrying resolved roles/entity scope; endpoints call **`Authorization.check`** (P02), never re-implement permission logic.
- **Cursor pagination only:** `?limit=` (default 25, max 100) + `cursor=`; response carries `next_cursor`. **No offset/page paging** (overrides v2).
- **`Idempotency-Key`** header on unsafe POSTs that start a transaction (SR posting, LMS provisioning, payroll feed, campaign enroll-batch, bond recovery, nomination); 24h replay returns the original.
- **`X-Correlation-Id`** carried/assigned on every request, echoed in the response header and written to every P05 audit/log line.
- Sorting/filtering `?sort=field:asc|desc`. Effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` (staged, not live — Platform §3.3) where applicable.

### 10.2 Canonical error envelope (Foundation §1; overrides v2)
```json
{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "message": "obtained_score exceeds max_score", "field": "obtained_score", "details": {} } }
```
2xx returns the resource payload; 4xx/5xx return the envelope. The correlation id is carried in the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header**, not a body `requestId`.

### 10.3 Standard error-code table (8 codes) + module error mapping
| Standard code | HTTP | Used by PS07 for |

## 14. Migration & Launch (on P06)

### 14.1 Data migration (P06 ETL+V)
Runs on **P06** (Extract→Validate→Transform→Load→Verify; three staging dry runs; waves; `migration_runs` ledger; **`gov_source_id`** traceability against the legacy training register; failed records logged with source row + violated rule).

| Source | Target | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy skill/competency lists | `skill_categories`/`skills`/`competencies` | Map → validate → load (source=IMPORT); descriptors required before PUBLISH; L&D review |
| Existing employee qualifications/certs | `certifications`, `employee_skills` | Import with `sr_posting_status=NOT_REQUIRED` for historical; flag significant for back-posting (gated); set `last_validated_at` from import date |
| Externally-acquired credentials | `certifications`(EXTERNAL_PROFESSIONAL) | Import with `verification_status=PENDING`; L&D verifies before PS12 eligibility |
| Historical training records | programs/sessions/nominations (closed) | Load as COMPLETED for history/analytics |
| Legacy budgets | `training_budgets` | Load current+prior FY at canonical entity/org-unit+FY key |
| Vendor/empanelment master | `vendor_empanelments` | Import EMPANELLED vendors with contract/procurement refs |
| E-learning content | `lms_content_packages` | Register SCORM/xAPI packages with version + WCAG; declare hosting + primary X.3 connector |

### 14.2 Cutover & launch (statutory spine first)
1. **Pin cross-module contracts** (PS12 SR-event, PS01 joiner, PS08 gap-feed, Gap Contract v1 — §10.8) with owning modules.
2. Load and publish taxonomy, proficiency levels (with descriptors), competencies, governed models (owner + review-due). Gate: L&D sign-off.
3. Stand up program catalog (FR-007) + content packages (FR-021) + **primary X.3 LRS/LMS connector** (FR-015) validated round-trip (P04 credentials).
4. **Prove the statutory spine end-to-end on ONE pilot entity:** campaign-based mandatory enrolment (FR-017) → attendance incl. kiosk/offline (FR-010/022) → completion → certification (FR-012) → idempotent **PS12 SR posting via X.3** (FR-016). Reconcile in P05 audit.
5. Import employee skills/certs + external credentials; run reconciliation report (zero unmatched against PS01 master).
6. Org-wide rollout of the statutory spine; publish Gap Contract v1 for PS06/PS08.
7. **Phase 2 (gated on curation evidence + RBAC capability flags):** weighted gap scoring, recommendations, marketplace, CPD targets.
8. Post-launch: monitor PS12 posting success, campaign coverage, nomination throughput, X.3 sync health, incremental-gap latency.

### 14.3 Rollback & safety
- Idempotent P06 imports/X.1 batch jobs re-runnable; SR back-posting gated behind explicit approval.
- Capability flags per developmental capability (§2.5); default OFF.
- Append-only ledgers (credential verifications, retention actions) + P05 immutability ensure no destructive migration of historical evidence.
- Campaign jobs resumable; partial failures do not duplicate (X.1 idempotency keys).

### 15.2 Parallel-agent build plan (statutory spine first)
| Wave | FRs (parallelisable) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **0 (contracts + platform wiring)** | §10.8 pinned contracts (PS12 SR-event, PS01 joiner, PS08 gap-feed, Gap Contract v1); register `VAL-PS07-*`/`JOB-PS07-*`/`MSG-PS07-*`/`ERR-PS07-*` and the new RBAC roles/flags | Unblock waves; ensure platform indices updated |
| 1 (foundation) | 001, 007 (catalog skeleton), 021 (content), 016 budget tables, 019 (empanelment) | Masters + content + budget/vendor base |
| 2 | 002 (governed models), 008, 015 (X.3 LRS config + P04 creds) | Build on masters; connector config |
| **3 (statutory spine — pilot)** | 009, 017 (campaign), 010+022 (attendance incl. kiosk/offline), 012, 016 (PS12 SR posting) | Prove mandatory-compliance → cert → PS12 SR end-to-end on one entity first |
| 4 | 003 (inventory+freshness), 005, 006 | Inventory, needs, plan |
| 5 | 004 (incremental gap), 024 (Gap Contract), 011, 013, 018 | Gap engine + contract + assessment + induction + external creds |
| 6 (Phase 2, flagged) | 014 (recommendations/marketplace), 020 (sponsorship), 023 (DPDP erasure) | Developmental layer + sponsorship + retention, gated on curation evidence |

### 15.3 External dependencies & register
| Dependency | Module/Service | Type | Contract pinned? | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Employee master / joiner events | **PS01** (PrimeSoft M01) | Hard | Yes (§10.8) | cache + X.3 retry |
| Appraisal development gaps | **PS08** | Soft | Yes (§10.8) | degraded gap mode (X.3 circuit-break) |
| Gap Contract consumers | **PS06**, **PS08** | Hard (sibling) | Yes (§10.8, v1) | versioned, backward-compatible |
| Service Register | **PS12** (on P05) | Hard (statutory) | Yes (§10.8) | X.3 queue + retry + alert |
| Documents | **PS13** | Hard | n/a | block upload, allow metadata |
| Payroll payable / bond recovery | **PS10** | Soft | feed schema | queue feed |
| LMS / LRS | External | Soft | X.3 connector + P04 cred | manual attendance fallback |
| Procurement system | External | Soft | reference / X.3 | manual empanelment entry |
| Workflow / Audit / Notify / Jobs / Migration / Authz | **P01/P05/X.2/X.1/P06/P02** | Hard (platform) | platform contracts | n/a — consumed, not built |

## 16. Glossary & Appendices

### 16.1 Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Competency | A cluster of related skills/behaviours required for effective role performance. |
| Skill | An atomic, assessable capability within the taxonomy. |
| Proficiency level | An ordered measure of capability depth, each with a concrete behavioural anchor. |
| Competency model | The competencies + target proficiencies a role/cadre requires, with owner + review cadence. |
| Skill freshness / staleness | Whether a validated skill is within its `revalidation_interval_months`; stale skills discounted from gap closure. |
| Gap Contract | The versioned read-only projection of gaps consumed by PS06/PS08. |
| Campaign | A scoped, bulk, wave-orchestrated mandatory-training drive with rolling renewal and escalation (JOB-PS07-CAMPAIGN). |
| Coverage denominator | The eligible population against which campaign completion % is measured. |
| Kirkpatrick model | Four-level evaluation: Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, Results (L3/L4 optional/sampled/programme-level). |
| CPD | Continuing Professional Development credits earned through learning. |
| SCORM / xAPI | E-learning standards; SCORM has no server push (poll the LMS reporting API via X.3); xAPI emits statements to an LRS. |
| LRS (Learning Record Store) | The endpoint receiving/serving xAPI statements; one X.3 connector is primary system of record. |
| Empanelment | Approved registration of an external vendor/trainer with contract/procurement reference. |
| Service bond | A post-sponsorship service-obligation period whose breach triggers cost recovery to PS10. |
| `is_significant` rule set | The configurable rules deciding which trainings/credentials post to the PS12 SR ledger. |
| P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3 | The PrimeSoft platform engines/infrastructure/configured-content models PS07 runs on. |
| PS-code | The enterprise module code scheme (`PS01..PS14`) adopted to avoid collision with PrimeSoft `Mxx`. |
| Maker-checker | SoD control (creator ≠ approver) enforced by P01/P02. |
| Kiosk/assisted mode | Attributed capture of learning actions for non-login staff (never anonymous). |
| DPDP erasure | Retention/erasure of learning PII at exit via the P05 redaction-marker path, honouring statutory overrides. |

### 16.2 Appendices
- **A. Default proficiency scale (with anchors):** L1 Awareness … L5 Expert — each `proficiency_levels.descriptor` carries a mandatory concrete behavioural anchor (`VAL-PS07-ANCHOR`, FR-PS07-001).
- **B. Default thresholds (configurable):** min attendance 80%; assessment pass 50%; renewal reminders 60/30/7 days; induction windows 30/60/90 days; budget alert ≥90%; skill revalidation default 24 months; competency-model review cadence 12 months; campaign escalation T-14/T-3/T+1 days.
- **C. Kirkpatrick capture model (reframed):** L1/L2 per participant; **L3/L4 optional, sampled, programme-level** (not per-employee T+90); L4 `responses_json` links named PS14 business-KPI keys. The fictional per-employee T+90 survey from v1 is removed.
- **D. `is_significant` rule set:** significant if ANY of: mandatory certification; externally accredited/professional credential (verified); programme duration ≥ threshold; promotion-relevant flag (PS06); sponsored degree/deputation. Configurable; matched rule(s) stored for audit (`VAL-PS07-SIGNIF`).
- **E. Single-LMS-of-record decision:** exactly one `learning_record_stores` is `is_primary` (`VAL-PS07-PRIMARYLRS`); xAPI via LRS ingest, SCORM via reporting-API poll on X.3, optional self-hosted SCORM player. No SCORM webhook anywhere.
- **F. Platform grounding references:** `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`, `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md`, and the platform extracts (Platform Spec v1.6 §P01–P06/X.1–X.3/W.1–W.3; Foundation FS v1.6 §1–§6; RBAC v1.7). PS07 references these by id and does not redefine them.

## Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform

This section maps every PS07 FR to the platform service(s) it runs on and names the **NET-NEW / EXTEND** posture. Per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A, PS07 has **no PrimeSoft counterpart** (LMS is a future phase) — it is **net-new business logic** that **runs entirely on existing platform engines**; it authors **no new platform engine** (the only enterprise engines authored from scratch are the statutory ones in other modules — SR ledger PS12, pension PS11, etc.).

| FR | Runs on (platform services) | Posture | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-PS07-001 Taxonomy/framework | **P01** (master publish), **P02**, **P05**, **X.2** | NET-NEW | `VAL-PS07-ANCHOR`; W.2 editor forms |

| FR-PS07-006 Annual plan & budget | **P01** (approval flow), **P05** | NET-NEW | canonical key |
| FR-PS07-007 Course catalog | **P01** (publish), **P02** | NET-NEW | — |
| FR-PS07-008 Sessions/trainers/venues | **P05**, **X.2** | NET-NEW | empanelment gate |
| FR-PS07-009 Nomination & approval | **P01** (WorkflowEngine, idempotent, version-pinned), **P02** (SoD), **P05** | NET-NEW | W.2 nomination form; Tasks aggregation |

| FR-PS07-016 SR posting & budget/cost | **X.3 → PS12** (on P05), **PS10** feed, **P02** (SoD), **P05** | NET-NEW + posts PS12 | `is_significant` |
| FR-PS07-017 Campaign engine | **P01** (approve), **X.1** (JOB-CAMPAIGN), **X.2** | NET-NEW | idempotent resumable jobs |

| FR-PS07-020 Sponsorship/bond | **P01** (sanction), **PS10** feed, **PS05** relieving event | NET-NEW | breach→recovery |
| FR-PS07-021 Content & item bank | **P01** (exception), **PS13**, **P02** (key mask) | NET-NEW | WCAG gate |

| FR-PS07-024 Gap Contract | **P02** (scope), **X.3** (payload versioning) | NET-NEW | feeds PS06/PS08 |

**Engines PS07 authors from scratch:** none (no `GAP (enterprise-specific)` platform engine). PS07 authors **business logic and configured content only** (W.1 flow definitions, W.2 forms, W.3 notification config, JOB-PS07-* logic/cadence, VAL-PS07-*/MSG-PS07-*/ERR-PS07-* ids, RBAC role/flag additions) and **posts by reference** into the PS12 SR ledger.

*End of PS07 Training and Skill Development Management BRD v3.0 (platform-grounded). This revision preserves all v2 content and rigor (25/25 council improvements, full 16-section structure, 0 unresolved gaps) and re-anchors the module onto the PrimeSoft platform: P01 workflow, P02 authz, P05 audit, P06 migration, X.1 jobs, X.2 notifications, X.3 integration, W.1/W.2/W.3 configured content, RBAC v1.7 roles, and the PS12 SR ledger — authoring business logic only, never re-implementing a platform engine.*
