/goal
  objective: Build the PS12 admissibility and distribution layer at BRD depth. The coverage delta
    (docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md) names "sect. 65B certificates, LTV renewal, subscriptions/feed"
    as still NOT_FOUND after PH-10B built verify/tamper-detect, Merkle anchors, and certified extracts. Implement
    per FR-18: sr_authenticity_certificates (E24) — a sect. 65B / Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam certificate for a
    certified extract binding the extract's content_digest, the covering anchor_id (chain head at issue), the
    statute_reference, and a structured chain-of-custody assembled from ledger/provenance/attestation data (never
    free-typed), with issuance access-logged as GENERATE_65B and refused when the certificate digest does not
    match the extract or the underlying chain fails verification (tamper). Per FR-13: sr_subscriptions with an
    authenticated pull feed (since_seq cursor, per-subscriber last_delivered_seq) delivering only the subscriber's
    registered event_categories with minimised payloads — no cross-subscriber/cross-tenant leak — and WEBHOOK/
    MESSAGE_BUS registration rejected with SR_DELIVERY_MODE_DEFERRED. Per FR-19: sr_ltv_renewals (E25) recording
    re-anchor/renewal events over existing anchors (RE_ANCHOR / ALGORITHM_MIGRATION) such that no historical
    entry_hash is recomputed or overwritten and renewed artefacts still verify.

  constraints:
    - A 65B certificate is only issued for a qualified-signed statutory extract (BR-18.1), and only after the
      extract's chain verifies against its covering anchor; a tampered chain or digest mismatch refuses issuance
      fail-closed (FR-18 AC4) — assert the refusal as a thrown error code in an executed test.
    - The chain-of-custody block is generated from stored ingestion/attestation/supersession data (BR-18.2);
      it must not accept a caller-supplied custody narrative.
    - The pull feed is scoped per subscriber: cursor state lives on the subscription (last_delivered_seq), events
      are filtered to the subscription's event_categories and tenant scope, and a subscriber can never read
      another subscriber's cursor or another tenant's events — cover the cross-subscriber negative in a test.
    - Feed payloads are minimised (sr_event_id, category, employee ref, content reference — not full sensitive
      payloads); subscribers dedupe by sr_event_id; corrigenda/reversals re-emit on the feed.
    - LTV renewal is additive evidence: a renewal writes an sr_ltv_renewals row and a new anchor over existing
      chain heads; original signed bytes and historical entry_hash values are never recomputed or overwritten —
      assert post-renewal verification of pre-renewal entries in a test.
    - Parameterised queries only; transactions around multi-step writes; no console.log; no stack traces in responses.
    - Do NOT weaken any oracle under docs/spec/pipeline/checks/**; do NOT touch phases.yaml, .state/, or approvals/.

  evidence_required:
    - apps/api/src/modules/ps12/** naming sr_authenticity_certificates, sr_subscriptions, sr_ltv_renewals,
      GENERATE_65B, since_seq/last_delivered_seq, SR_DELIVERY_MODE_DEFERRED

    - `bash docs/spec/pipeline/checks/ph-15d.sh` GREEN (external oracle; not self-certified)
  escalate_when:
    - The PH-10B anchor/extract substrate lacks a fact the certificate must cite (raise the gap; do not fabricate
      custody or anchor references).
    - Real TSA/CA signing is required beyond the existing signing seam (record as an integration dependency;
      keep the seam injectable, do not call external services from tests).
    - Feed scoping conflicts with an existing consumer contract (surface it; do not widen a subscriber's scope).
