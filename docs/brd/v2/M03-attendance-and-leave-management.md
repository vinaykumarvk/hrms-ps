## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Attendance and Leave Management module (M03-ATL) is the time-and-absence system of record for the HRMS. It captures **when and how employees work** (biometric / RFID / mobile-geo punches, shifts, rosters, overtime, work-from-home, on-duty/tour, holidays) and **when and why they are absent** (a full public-sector leave catalog with configurable accrual, carry-forward, encashment, and a fully auditable leave-balance ledger). It exposes self-service to employees, team controls to managers, configuration to HR, and feeds two downstream systems of record: the statutory **Digital Service Register** (via Module 04-LSR → M12-SR) and **Payroll** (M10-PAY) for loss-of-pay treatment.

### 1.2 Business problem
Public-sector time and leave administration is today fragmented across registers, spreadsheets, and disconnected biometric devices. This causes: leave balances that cannot be trusted, manual loss-of-pay (LWP) errors in payroll, no statutory leave posting into the Service Register, no team visibility for managers, and no audit trail for regularisation and backdating. M03-ATL replaces this with a single configurable engine and immutable ledgers, with concurrency-safe balance debits, DPDP-compliant biometric/geo governance, and anti-fraud controls.

### 1.3 Goals & success metrics
| # | Goal | Metric / target |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Trustworthy leave balances | 100% of balance changes traceable to a ledger entry; zero unreconciled balances at year-close; **zero lost-update / oversubscription incidents** (concurrency-controlled). |
| G2 | Automated attendance capture | ≥ 95% of daily attendance auto-computed without manual intervention. |
| G3 | Accurate payroll feed | 0 LWP discrepancies between M03 export and M10 import per cycle; **0 silent corruptions of locked periods** (next-period adjustment only). |
| G4 | Statutory compliance | 100% of approved leave events posted to Digital SR (via M04) within SLA; **100% of biometric/geo capture covered by a recorded lawful basis + consent or non-biometric fallback.** |
| G5 | Self-service adoption | ≥ 90% of leave applications submitted by employees themselves (web/mobile). |
| G6 | Approval timeliness | P50 leave-approval turnaround ≤ 24h; auto-escalation **and auto-delegation** on breach/absence. |
| G7 | Fraud resistance | ≥ 99% of buddy-punching / impossible-travel anomalies auto-flagged for review before payroll feed lock. |

### 1.4 Scope summary
**In scope:** shift & roster management; holiday calendars by location; punch ingestion, deduplication & **anomaly/fraud detection**; daily attendance processing & **sub-day allocation**; missed-punch regularisation; overtime; WFH; on-duty/tour; compensatory-off; leave-type & accrual policy configuration (incl. **commuted 2:1**, **leave-year basis**, **rounding/proration**, **sandwich rule per type**); accrual engine; **concurrency-controlled** leave-balance ledger and **soft-reserve reservations**; **entitlement counters** for sanction-based leave; leave application/approval/cancellation; backdated leave; team calendar & conflict detection; **approval delegation/out-of-office**; leave-year close (carry-forward / lapse); encashment (incl. **retirement EL+HPL shortfall make-up** and **LTC**); attendance-and-leave → payroll feed with **locked-period adjustments**; **DPDP biometric/geo consent & non-biometric fallback**; **best-in-class absence features** (what-if forecast, mass-leave/shutdown, blackout/freeze, return-to-work).
**Out of scope (referenced, not built here):** statutory SR posting internals (M04/M12), payroll computation (M10), terminal-benefit settlement (M11), document storage internals (M13), cross-module analytics surface (M14).

### 1.5 Key stakeholders
Employees, Reporting Managers, HR Officers/Admins, Department Heads/Sanctioning Authorities, Payroll Officers (consumers), SR Custodian (consumer via M04), Auditors, Data Protection Officer (DPDP), System Administrators.

## 4. Shared Application Foundation
This module **inherits** the Shared Foundation (`docs/brd/SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`) without redefinition:
- **Entities reused:** `employees`, `users`, `org_units`, `designations`, `cadres`, `roles`/`permissions`, `service_register_events`, `documents`, `notifications`, `audit_log`, `workflow_instances`, `workflow_tasks`.
- **Conventions:** UUIDv4 PKs + human business keys; standard audit columns; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE enums; UTC storage / locale display; paginated lists (max 100); maker-checker through the shared workflow engine.
- **Tech defaults:** React+TS (Tailwind/shadcn) front-end; REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL; object storage for documents; OIDC/SSO+MFA+JWT; RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping.
- **Error envelope:** `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field" }, "requestId" }`.
- **NFR baseline:** P95 < 500ms; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15min / RTO ≤ 4h; OWASP ASVS; DPDP-Act-2023-aligned PII handling.

M03 extends the shared workflow engine with module workflow templates (leave approval, regularisation, encashment, anomaly review, return-to-work) and the shared `notifications` ledger with module event types. Sensitive-personal-data handling (biometric templates, geo) is governed under M03's DPDP layer (FR-21, §9, App. E).

### 5.6 Data integrity rules
1. **Ledger-balance reconciliation:** `leave_balances.current_balance` MUST equal the `balance_after` of the latest `leave_balance_ledger` entry for that (employee, leave_type, leave_year). Enforced by trigger + nightly reconciliation job.
2. **Non-negative balances:** an `AVAIL`/`ENCASHMENT` debit cannot drive `balance_after` below 0 except where `leave_accrual_policies.advance_allowed=true`.
3. **Append-only ledgers:** `leave_balance_ledger`, `comp_off_ledger`, `attendance_punches` permit INSERT only; corrections via compensating entries, never UPDATE/DELETE.
4. **One day-row, many allocations:** UNIQUE(`employee_id`,`attendance_date`) on `attendance_daily`; allocations in `attendance_day_allocations` for that day MUST sum `day_fraction` ≤ 1.0 (R2). UNIQUE(`application_id`,`leave_date`) across active leave application days.
5. **Idempotent ingestion:** UNIQUE(`device_id`,`source_ref`) on punches; replays mark `DUPLICATE`.
6. **Transactional writes:** leave approval = (consume reservation + insert ledger debit + update balance with version check + write allocations recompute-enqueue + update application status + enqueue SR posting + enqueue notification) in a single DB transaction.
7. **FK integrity:** all employee/org references resolve to active M01 records; soft-deleted employees block new applications.
8. **Gender/eligibility guard:** Maternity/CCL restricted to `gender_eligibility=FEMALE`; Paternity to `MALE`; cadre restrictions and **dependent-based eligibility (E29)** enforced at apply-time.
9. **Date sanity:** `end_date >= start_date`; backdated leave only within configurable window; future-dated punches rejected.
10. **No self-approval / no self-clear:** `workflow_tasks.assignee_id` ≠ application `created_by`/`employee_id`; an anomaly reviewer ≠ punch owner; a delegate ≠ applicant.
11. **Soft-reserve persistence (R1):** every `SUBMITTED` application holds a `leave_reservations` row; `leave_balances.reserved` = Σ active `RESERVED` units; `available_balance = current_balance − reserved`; reservations auto-`RELEASED` after `RESERVATION_TTL_MIN` if undecided.
12. **Concurrency control (R1):** balance debits acquire `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the `leave_balances` row and assert the optimistic `version`; a stale version aborts with `OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`; two concurrent approvals cannot both pass the available-balance check.
13. **Present-units derivation (R2):** `attendance_daily.present_units` = Σ `day_fraction` of allocations where `counts_as_present=true`; FR-17 LWP/half-pay/present figures derive from allocations, not from a single status label.
14. **Commuted 2:1 (R4):** availing a leave type with `debit_ratio>1` and `debits_against_leave_type_id` set posts the debit (units × ratio) against the referenced pot's ledger/balance; insufficient target balance → `COMMUTED_REQUIRES_HPL`.
15. **Sanction entitlement (R7,R14):** sanction-based types (`is_sanction_based=true`) validate against `leave_entitlements.remaining_days` and `eligibility_predicate` at apply-time; ledger records informational `AVAIL` without a negative-balance exception.
16. **Sandwich rule (R13):** `leave_application_days.is_non_working` days are included in `total_days`/debit per the leave type's `sandwich_rule`; computed deterministically and shown in balance preview.
17. **Single attendance writer (R15):** only FR-04 writes `attendance_daily`/`attendance_day_allocations`; FR-05/07/08/12/13 enqueue a recompute via `attendance_processing_runs`.
18. **Comp-off SSOT (R17):** comp-off balance lives only in `comp_off_ledger`; no `leave_balances` row for COMPOFF.
19. **Day-units equality (R18):** `SUM(leave_application_days.day_units)` MUST equal `leave_applications.total_days` (trigger + validator; error `DAY_UNITS_MISMATCH`).
20. **Advance clawback (R19):** on RESIGNED/TRANSFERRED/DECEASED/RETIRED before advance-credited leave is earned, a `CLAWBACK` ledger entry (or payroll recovery via feed adjustment) reverses the unearned units; accrual is suspended during LWP/SUSPENDED/dies-non per `suspend_accrual_on_lwp`.
21. **Locked-period immutability (R6):** a feed period with `is_locked=true` is never overwritten; corrections are recorded in `payroll_feed_adjustments` against the next open period.
22. **Consent gating (R9):** a `BIOMETRIC`/`MOBILE_GEO` punch requires an active governing `biometric_consents` (GRANTED or STATUTORY_DUTY); otherwise the employee's `fallback_method` is used or the punch is `REJECTED` with `CONSENT_REQUIRED`.

### 5.8 End-to-end worked example — "one leave day, end to end" *(R23 / Outsider)*
> PS-1001 (EL year basis CALENDAR, current 130.0, reserved 0). Applies for 0.5-day EL on 2026-07-10 (FIRST_HALF), works the afternoon.

1. **Apply (FR-12):** `total_days = 0.5` (sandwich rule N/A — single working day), `ledger_debit_units = 0.5 × debit_ratio(1.0) = 0.5`. A `leave_reservations` row (0.5, RESERVED) is created; `leave_balances.reserved` → 0.5, `available_balance` → 129.5. Balance preview shows `before 130.0, softReserved 0.5, available 129.5`. (`SUM(day_units)=0.5=total_days` passes — R18.)
2. **Concurrency (R1):** a second concurrent application by the same employee re-reads `available_balance` already net of the 0.5 reservation; the balance row is locked `FOR UPDATE` with version assertion at debit time.
3. **Approve (FR-12, single txn):** reservation `CONSUMED`; ledger `AVAIL −0.5` (balance_after 129.5); `leave_balances.current_balance` 129.5, `reserved` 0, `version`++; application `APPROVED`; SR enqueue (`PENDING`); notification queued. A recompute is **enqueued** (not written) for 2026-07-10 (R15).
4. **Attendance (FR-04, sole writer):** recompute writes two allocations for 2026-07-10 — `ON_LEAVE×0.5 (counts_as_present=true, paid)` + `PRESENT×0.5` — `present_units = 1.0`; `status` rollup = `PRESENT`/`HALF_DAY` per precedence (R2).
5. **SR (M04):** approved EL event posts to Digital SR; `sr_posting_status` → `POSTED` on ack.
6. **Payroll feed (FR-17):** July period aggregates `present_units` (1.0 for that day), `lwp_days 0`, `half_pay_days 0`. If 2026-07 is later locked and a regularisation changes the day, a `payroll_feed_adjustments` row corrects the next open period (R6).
7. **Year-close (FR-15):** at 2026 close, EL above CF cap (300) lapses; opening 2027 balance posted as `OPENING` ledger entry; reconciliation = 0 mismatch.

### FR-01 — Shift & Roster Management
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin (configure); Employee/Manager (view)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to define shifts and assign employees to rosters so that attendance is evaluated against the correct working pattern.
- **Description:** Create/maintain shift definitions (timings, grace, thresholds, night flag, breaks, **date-anchor rule & display timezone**) and assign employees to shifts over date ranges with a weekly-off pattern. Supports rotating rosters and bulk assignment by org unit.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. HR can create a shift with start/end/grace/thresholds, scope, and `date_anchor_rule`.
  2. HR can assign one or more employees to a shift for a date range with a weekly-off pattern.
  3. Overlapping PUBLISHED rosters for the same employee/date are rejected with `ROSTER_OVERLAP`.
  4. Publishing a roster supersedes any prior open-ended roster for the same employee from the new `effective_from`.
  5. Employees and managers can view applicable shift/weekly-off for any date.
  6. **(v2/R6)** A roster edit affecting a date in a locked payroll period does NOT overwrite the fed day; it emits a `payroll_feed_adjustments` record for the next open period.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Night shifts (`is_night_shift=true`) attribute the worked period to the shift start date via `date_anchor_rule=SHIFT_START_LOCAL_DATE` (R16).
  - Weekly-off pattern supports fixed days and alternating Saturdays (`SAT2`,`SAT4` = 2nd/4th Saturday of the month — App. B legend).
  - Only ACTIVE shifts may be assigned.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Shift form with time pickers and date-anchor selector; roster assignment grid with multi-select employees and a visual weekly-off picker; conflict banner on overlap; locked-period warning on retroactive edit.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-period shift change; employee transferred (M05) mid-roster; alternating-Saturday boundary at month/year edge; **roster edit into a locked period → adjustment, not overwrite**; multi-timezone (display_timezone) attribution.

### FR-02 — Holiday Calendar Management (by location)
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin (configure); all (view)
- **User Story:** As an HR Admin, I want location-specific holiday calendars so attendance and leave-day computation honour the right holidays per office.
- **Description:** Define yearly holiday calendars bound to org/location scope, with gazetted/restricted/sectional/optional types; employees elect Restricted Holidays (RH) within a cap, persisted in **`rh_elections`**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. HR can create a calendar for a year/location and add holidays.
  2. Duplicate date in the same calendar is rejected (`HOLIDAY_DUPLICATE`).
  3. Publishing a calendar makes it the basis for attendance/leave computation in scope.
  4. **(v2/R8)** Employees elect up to `rh_cap` restricted holidays, stored in `rh_elections`; exceeding the cap → `RH_CAP_EXCEEDED`.
  5. Holidays sandwiched between leave count or not per the leave type's `sandwich_rule` (R13).
  6. **(v2/R6)** Holiday edits affecting a locked payroll period emit a feed adjustment, not an overwrite.
- **Business Rules:** A holiday on a roster weekly-off does not double-grant; an employee inherits the calendar of their org unit/location; RH cap default 2 (overridable via `module_config`).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | holiday_calendars | Calendar master |
  | holidays | Dates |
  | rh_elections | RH election persistence (R8) |

  | GET | /api/v1/atl/holidays?date=&orgUnitId= | Resolve holidays |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Calendar grid view; bulk import (CSV) of holidays; RH-election self-service with remaining-count badge backed by `rh_elections`.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year office relocation (which calendar applies); national vs sectional overlap on same date; RH already availed when calendar edited; RH cap change mid-year.

### FR-03 — Attendance Punch Ingestion (biometric / RFID / mobile-geo)
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** System (devices), Employee (mobile/web), SysAdmin (device config)
- **User Story:** As the system, I want to reliably ingest punches from biometric/RFID devices and the mobile app so daily attendance can be computed accurately, idempotently, **with consent governance and anti-fraud screening**.
- **Description:** Accept punch events from registered devices and the mobile app with geofence validation; deduplicate; classify direction; **derive `attendance_date` via the shift's date-anchor rule**; **screen for anomalies and gate on consent**; store raw immutably.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A punch with a known `(device_id, source_ref)` already ingested is marked `DUPLICATE`, not re-stored.
  2. Mobile punches outside the device geofence are `REJECTED` with `GEOFENCE_VIOLATION`.
  3. Punches from unknown/inactive devices are rejected (`DEVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED`).
  4. Future-dated punches are rejected (`INVALID_PUNCH_TIME`).
  5. All accepted punches are immutable and append-only.
  6. **(v2/R16)** `attendance_date` is derived from the applicable shift's `date_anchor_rule` (night shift → shift start local date).
  7. **(v2/R9)** A biometric/geo punch lacking an active governing consent uses the employee's `fallback_method`; if none, it is `REJECTED` with `CONSENT_REQUIRED`.
  8. **(v2/R10)** Punches triggering anomaly rules (impossible travel, duplicate-second, geo mismatch, low liveness, device-binding mismatch) are stored with `ingestion_status=FLAGGED_FOR_REVIEW` and open a `punch_anomaly_reviews` case (see FR-20).
- **Business Rules:** Device authenticated via hashed API key/cert; mobile requires authenticated user + GPS; direction inferred (odd=IN/even=OUT) when not supplied; clock skew tolerance ±`CLOCK_SKEW_MIN` (module_config); `EMPLOYEE_BOUND` devices reject punches for a different employee.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | attendance_punches | Raw store (photo/liveness/anomaly fields) |
  | attendance_devices | Source auth, geofence, binding, liveness |

  | POST | /api/v1/atl/punches/ingest | Device batch ingest |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/punches/mobile | Mobile geo punch (+ optional photo/liveness) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Mobile "Punch In/Out" with live GPS + map pin and optional liveness/selfie; confirmation toast with server time; offline queue with sync; consent banner if not enrolled, offering fallback.
- **Edge Cases:** Device clock drift; duplicate replays after network retry; multiple devices same gate; GPS spoofing → `FLAGGED_FOR_REVIEW`; offline mobile punches synced later; consent withdrawn between punches (fallback engages).

### FR-04 — Daily Attendance Processing, Sub-Day Allocation & Status Computation
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** System (scheduled), HR Officer (rerun)
- **User Story:** As the system, I want to compute each employee's daily attendance as a **sub-day allocation set** from punches, roster, holidays, leave, and exceptions so that part-leave/part-present days and downstream payroll are accurate.
- **Description:** Nightly (and on-demand) batch derives `attendance_daily` + `attendance_day_allocations` by combining punches, roster/shift, holiday calendar, approved leave (incl. half-day), and WFH/OD exceptions; computes worked minutes, late/early, `present_units`, and a derived `status` rollup. **FR-04 is the sole writer of `attendance_daily`/allocations (R15).**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Days with approved leave → an `ON_LEAVE` allocation; holiday → `HOLIDAY`; weekly-off → `WEEKLY_OFF`.
  2. Worked minutes ≥ full-day threshold → `PRESENT`; between half and full → `HALF_DAY`; below → `ABSENT`.
  3. Punch-in only / out only → `MISSING_PUNCH`.
  4. WFH/OD approved → `WFH`/`ON_DUTY` allocation regardless of punches.
  5. Re-running for a date is idempotent and overwrites only system-computed (non-regularised) rows; recorded under an `attendance_processing_runs` row.
  6. **(v2/R2)** A day with half-day leave and a worked afternoon produces TWO allocations (e.g. `ON_LEAVE×0.5` + `PRESENT×0.5`) summing ≤ 1.0; `present_units` reflects both; `status` is the highest-precedence rollup.
  7. **(v2/R15)** FR-04 consumes recompute requests enqueued by FR-05/07/08/12/13; those FRs never write `attendance_daily` directly.
- **Business Rules:** Precedence for rollup: Leave > Holiday > Weekly-off > WFH/OD > Punch-derived (App. B). Night-shift spans attributed per `date_anchor_rule`. Regularised days are not overwritten. Allocation sum ≤ 1.0 enforced (`ALLOCATION_EXCEEDS_DAY`).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | attendance_daily | Output rollup |
  | attendance_day_allocations | Sub-day allocations (R2) |
  | attendance_processing_runs | Run record (R8) |

  |---|---|---|
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/attendance/process | Trigger run (date/scope) |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/attendance/daily?employeeId=&from=&to= | View (with allocations) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Monthly attendance grid with color-coded statuses; cells showing split allocations (e.g. half-leave/half-present); legend; drill to punches; HR "reprocess" action with scope picker and run-history.
- **Edge Cases:** Late punch sync after run (auto re-trigger); employee with no roster (defaults to GEN or flagged); leave approved after processing (recompute enqueued); part-day OD + part-day leave; allocation overflow guarded.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `AttendanceProcessor`, `AllocationResolver`, `StatusRollupDeriver`, `ProcessingRunTracker`, scheduler job |
  | Backend Flow | Open run → for each employee/date: load inputs → build allocation set (≤1.0) → compute minutes/late/present_units → derive status rollup → UPSERT (skip regularised) → close run |
  | Data Operations | UPSERT attendance_daily + allocations (UNIQUE employee/date) in batched txns; INSERT processing_run |
  | Validation | Roster existence, input completeness, allocation-sum ≤ 1.0 |
  | Authorization | System; HR rerun scoped |

### FR-05 — Missed-Punch Regularisation
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (raise), Manager/HR (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to regularise a missed or incorrect punch with justification so my attendance reflects reality after approval.
- **Description:** Employee submits a correction for a `MISSING_PUNCH`/`ABSENT`/`HALF_DAY` day with proposed times and reason; routed to manager; on approval an **FR-04 recompute is enqueued** and the day is locked as regularised.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Employee can raise regularisation only for own past days within the configurable window (`REGULARISATION_WINDOW_DAYS`, default 15).
  2. **(v2/R15)** Approval enqueues an FR-04 recompute that sets `is_regularised=true`; FR-05 does not write `attendance_daily` directly.
  3. Rejected requests leave attendance unchanged with reason logged.
  4. A monthly cap on regularisations is enforced (`REGULARISATION_LIMIT`).
  5. Audit captures before/after status.
  6. **(v2/R6)** Regularisation of a day in a locked payroll period emits a `payroll_feed_adjustments` correction for the next open period; it never overwrites the fed day.
- **Business Rules:** Manager approval required; HR can act on behalf; document optional but configurable per status; window/cap sourced from `module_config`.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | regularisation_requests | Request |
  | attendance_processing_runs | Recompute enqueue |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** From attendance grid, "Regularise" on an eligible day opens a form; manager inbox shows pending; status timeline; locked-period notice.
- **Edge Cases:** Period locked by payroll → adjustment; cap exceeded; backdated beyond window; concurrent regularisation + leave on same day (allocation reconciliation).

### FR-06 — Overtime Capture & Approval
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee/Manager (claim/recommend), HR/Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want approved overtime to be either paid or converted to compensatory-off so extra hours are fairly compensated.
- **Description:** Capture OT from worked-minutes beyond shift or on holidays/weekly-offs; submit claim with treatment (paid/comp-off); on approval, paid OT flows to payroll feed and comp-off credits the **comp_off_ledger (sole comp-off SSOT, R17)**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. OT can only be claimed where actual worked minutes exceed shift end + grace (validated against punches).
  2. Approved `PAID` OT contributes `paid_ot_minutes` to the payroll feed.
  3. Approved `COMP_OFF` OT creates an `EARN` entry in `comp_off_ledger` with expiry.
  4. OT rate multiplier applies per policy (e.g. 2x on holidays).
  5. Duplicate OT for the same date is prevented.
- **Business Rules:** Comp-off earned expires after `COMPOFF_VALIDITY_DAYS` (default 90); holiday/weekly-off OT defaults to comp-off unless paid-OT policy applies; max OT/month cap.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | overtime_records | Claim |
  | comp_off_ledger | Comp-off earn (SSOT) |
  | payroll_attendance_feed | Paid OT |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** OT claim shows computed eligible minutes (read-only) with treatment toggle; approver sees evidence; comp-off balance widget reads `comp_off_ledger`.
- **Edge Cases:** OT claimed but punches don't support it (rejected); comp-off expiry before redemption; OT on a leave day; cap exceeded.

### FR-07 — Work-From-Home (WFH)
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to request work-from-home days so my attendance is recorded as working without office punches.
- **Description:** Employee applies for WFH for a date range (optionally half-day); on approval the affected days are computed as a `WFH` allocation (counted as present) by **FR-04 (recompute enqueued, R15)**; optional WFH-day cap per month.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Approved WFH days produce a `WFH` allocation that counts as present for payroll.
  2. WFH cannot overlap an existing approved leave/holiday (allocation conflict).
  3. Monthly WFH cap enforced if configured.
  4. Manager approval required; HR can apply on behalf.
  5. **(v2/R15)** Approval enqueues an FR-04 recompute; FR-07 does not write `attendance_daily`.
- **Business Rules:** WFH excluded on weekly-off/holiday (no-op); WFH may still require optional self check-in via mobile (policy); half-day WFH supported via `day_portion`.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | attendance_exceptions | WFH record |

  | POST | /api/v1/atl/exceptions/{id}/decision | Approve |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Date-range picker with conflict pre-check and half-day toggle; approved WFH appears on team calendar (FR-14).
- **Edge Cases:** WFH overlapping leave; cap exceeded; cancellation after partial period; half-day WFH + half-day present.

### FR-08 — On-Duty / Tour / Outdoor Duty
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager/Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As a field officer, I want to record on-duty/tour days so my absence from the office is treated as official duty, not leave.
- **Description:** Capture On-Duty/Tour with location, purpose, and supporting order; approved days compute as an `ON_DUTY` allocation (present) via **FR-04 (recompute enqueued)**; links to tour order document.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Approved OD/Tour days produce an `ON_DUTY` allocation and count as present.
  2. Tour requires a location and may require an order document.
  3. OD cannot overlap approved leave.
  4. Tour spanning weekly-off/holiday optionally counts per policy.
  5. **(v2/R15)** Approval enqueues FR-04 recompute; FR-08 does not write `attendance_daily`.
- **Business Rules:** Tour may generate comp-off if it includes holidays worked (policy → `comp_off_ledger`); OD distinct from WFH in reports; half-day OD supported via `day_portion`.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

### FR-09 — Compensatory-Off Earning & Redemption
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (redeem), System/Manager (earn/approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want comp-off credited for approved holiday/OT work and to redeem it as time off before it expires.
- **Description:** Maintain an append-only **`comp_off_ledger` as the single source of truth for comp-off balance (R17)**; earn entries from FR-06/FR-08; redeem via a COMPOFF leave application (redemption vehicle only — no `leave_balances` row); expire unused credits on a scheduled job.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Earn entries credit the ledger with an `expires_on`.
  2. Redemption debits FIFO from non-expired credits.
  3. Redemption beyond balance is rejected (`COMP_OFF_INSUFFICIENT`).
  4. A daily job expires past-due credits (`EXPIRE` entries) and notifies owners ahead of expiry.
  5. Ledger balance reconciles to `balance_after` of latest entry.
  6. **(v2/R17)** COMPOFF leave applications debit `comp_off_ledger` only; there is no parallel COMPOFF `leave_balances`/ledger row.
- **Business Rules:** FIFO consumption; default 90-day validity; comp-off counted as paid present allocation; no negative balance.
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-10 — Leave-Type & Accrual-Policy Configuration
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin
- **User Story:** As an HR Admin, I want to configure leave types and their accrual/carry-forward/encashment policies — including commuted 2:1, leave-year basis, rounding, and sandwich rule — so the engine applies the correct statutory rules per cadre and office.
- **Description:** Maintain the leave catalog and versioned accrual policies scoped by org unit/cadre with caps, carry-forward, lapse, encashment, **`debit_ratio`/`debits_against_leave_type_id` (commuted), `year_basis`, `sandwich_rule`, `rounding_mode`/`proration_method`, sanction flag, retirement-encash flag**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. HR can create/deactivate leave types with category, eligibility, document, caps, **year_basis, sandwich_rule, debit_ratio, sanction flag**.
  2. HR can define a versioned accrual policy per type/scope with frequency, quantity, basis, **rounding_mode, proration_method**, caps, carry-forward, lapse rule, encashment caps.
  3. Overlapping ACTIVE policies for the same type/scope/date are rejected (`POLICY_OVERLAP`).
  4. Gender/cadre/**dependent** eligibility is enforced downstream at apply-time.
  5. Policy changes are versioned (effective_from/to), never destructive.
  6. **(v2/R4)** A type with `debit_ratio>1` MUST specify `debits_against_leave_type_id` (e.g. COMMUTED→HPL) or be rejected (`COMMUTED_REQUIRES_HPL` at config validation).
- **Business Rules:** Statutory caps preset (Maternity 180, Paternity 15, etc.) but editable; HPL = half-pay; **Commuted leave debits 2× HPL (R4)**; LWP affects pay and service; sanction-based types defined via `is_sanction_based` and backed by `leave_entitlements` (FR-22).
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-11 — Accrual Engine, Rounding/Proration & Leave-Balance Ledger
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** System (scheduled), HR Officer (adjust)
- **User Story:** As the system, I want to accrue leave per policy with a defined rounding and proration rule and record every balance change in an immutable, concurrency-safe ledger so balances are always auditable and reconcilable.
- **Description:** Scheduled accrual job credits leave per policy writing `ACCRUAL` ledger entries with **explicit rounding (`rounding_mode`) and proration (`proration_method`) per leave-year basis**; every avail/encash/lapse/adjustment/**clawback** also writes the ledger; balances are the reconciled projection with an **optimistic `version`**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Accrual job credits the correct quantity per active policy and updates balance.
  2. Every balance mutation writes exactly one ledger entry with `balance_after`.
  3. `leave_balances.current_balance` always equals latest ledger `balance_after` (reconciliation passes).
  4. **(v2/R3)** Pro-rated accrual on mid-year joining/leaving uses `proration_method`; the fraction is rounded per `rounding_mode` (default nearest-0.5 with fractional remainder carried to next cycle); a worked example is documented (App. C).
  5. Manual adjustments require maker-checker and a reason.
  6. **(v2/R1)** Balance debits use `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` + `version` assertion; a concurrent stale debit fails with `OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.
  7. **(v2/R19)** Accrual is suspended during LWP/SUSPENDED/dies-non per `suspend_accrual_on_lwp`; on exit before advance-credited leave is earned, a `CLAWBACK` entry reverses unearned units.
- **Business Rules:** Accrual respects `max_balance_cap`; HPL accrues separately; no balance change occurs outside the ledger; rounding remainder carried forward, never silently dropped.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Balance card per leave type; ledger statement view (date, type, +/-, balance) downloadable; adjustment form with checker step; rounding-remainder note.
- **Edge Cases:** Re-run accrual (idempotent guard per cycle); cap reached (credit truncated + note); negative adjustment below 0; **concurrent avail during accrual (version conflict resolved)**; mid-year exit clawback; rounding remainder carry.

### FR-12 — Leave Application & Approval Workflow (Reservation, Concurrency, Sandwich)
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager (recommend), HR/Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to apply for leave with half-day support and have it approved through the right chain, with a real balance reservation, deterministic sandwich-rule day counting, and my balance and the Service Register updated automatically and atomically.
- **Description:** Employee applies (type, dates, half-day portions, reason, document); system computes `total_days` per **`sandwich_rule`** and `ledger_debit_units` per **`debit_ratio`**, validates `available_balance` (net of reservations) or **`leave_entitlements`** for sanction types, creates a **`leave_reservations` hold**, routes through a configurable approval chain (with **delegation**, FR-19); on approval, atomically consumes the reservation, debits the ledger (against the correct pot for commuted), enqueues an FR-04 recompute to set the `ON_LEAVE` allocation, and (for SR-relevant types) enqueues a Digital SR posting via M04.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. **(v2/R13)** `total_days` includes weekly-off/holidays per the leave type's `sandwich_rule`, deterministically, and is shown in the balance preview; `SUM(day_units)=total_days` (R18).
  2. **(v2/R1)** On submit, a `leave_reservations` row holds `ledger_debit_units`; `available_balance` reflects the hold; insufficient available balance → `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` (except advance-allowed types).
  3. **(v2/R1)** On approval, a single transaction: lock balance row (FOR UPDATE + version) → consume reservation → ledger `AVAIL` debit (against `debits_against_leave_type_id` if set) → balance/version update → application APPROVED → enqueue FR-04 recompute → SR enqueue → notification.
  4. Eligibility (gender/cadre/document/**dependent**) enforced; sanction types validated against `leave_entitlements` (FR-22).
  5. Approval chain configurable (Manager → HR; special leaves → Sanctioning Authority); absent approver auto-routes to delegate (FR-19).
  6. SR-relevant approved leave sets `sr_posting_status=PENDING` then `POSTED` on M04 ack.
  7. **(v2/R4)** Availing COMMUTED debits 2× against HPL; insufficient HPL → `COMMUTED_REQUIRES_HPL`.
  8. **(v2/Proponent)** Applications in a configured blackout/freeze window are blocked (`BLACKOUT_PERIOD`); long-medical types set `return_to_work_status=PENDING` (FR-23).
- **Business Rules:** No double-booking a day; Commuted/Medical require document; Maternity/CCL gender+dependent-restricted; advance leave only for configured types; balance held via real reservation (not phantom).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Apply wizard: type → date range with per-day half/full toggle → live balance preview (showing softReserved/available and sandwich-counted days) → document upload → submit; approver inbox with team-conflict indicator and delegate badge; status timeline with SR-posting badge.
- **Edge Cases:** Balance changes between submit and approve (reservation + version resolve); concurrent approvals (lost-update prevented); holiday sandwiched (rule-driven); SR posting fails (retry queue, FAILED, HR alert); applicant = approver/delegate (blocked); commuted with low HPL; blackout window.

### FR-13 — Leave Cancellation & Modification
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), Manager/HR (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to cancel or withdraw leave (whole or partial, before or after start) so unused leave is credited back correctly.
- **Description:** Support withdrawal of a SUBMITTED application (releases reservation) and cancellation of an APPROVED one (full or partial future days); approved cancellation reverses the ledger debit (`AVAIL_REVERSAL`, against the correct pot for commuted), enqueues an FR-04 recompute, and reverses/cancels any SR posting via M04; locked-period impacts emit a feed adjustment.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. SUBMITTED application can be withdrawn by applicant (no approval) → `leave_reservations` `RELEASED`; `available_balance` restored.
  2. APPROVED future leave can be cancelled (full/partial) with approval → `AVAIL_REVERSAL` credit for cancelled days only.
  3. Past/availed days cannot be cancelled (`CANNOT_CANCEL_PAST`).
  4. **(v2/R15)** Attendance for cancelled days recomputed via FR-04 enqueue; SR posting reversal enqueued for SR-relevant leave.
  5. Audit captures original vs revised.
  6. **(v2/R6)** Cancellation touching a locked payroll period emits a `payroll_feed_adjustments` correction.
- **Business Rules:** Partial cancellation only for future, contiguous-tail or specific days per policy; encashed/closed-year leave not cancellable; reversal amount = exact debited units (post debit_ratio) for cancelled days; commuted reversal credits HPL.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Cancel modal with selectable future days and credited-back preview; status changes to CANCELLED/WITHDRAWN.
- **Edge Cases:** Cancel after partial availment; concurrent payroll lock → adjustment; SR already posted (reversal event); cancel of comp-off redemption restores comp-off credit; commuted reversal to HPL.

### FR-14 — Backdated Leave & Team-Calendar Conflict Detection
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager (view/approve)
- **User Story:** As a manager, I want a team leave calendar that flags coverage conflicts and to control backdated leave so staffing and compliance are maintained.
- **Description:** Allow backdated leave within a configurable window (`BACKDATE_WINDOW_DAYS`) with mandatory justification and elevated approval; provide a manager team calendar visualising leave/WFH/OD/holidays and flagging concurrent-absence thresholds (`CONFLICT_THRESHOLD_PCT`).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Backdated leave permitted only within window and flagged `is_backdated=true` with elevated approval.
  2. Team calendar shows all team members' leave/WFH/OD/holidays for a selected month.
  3. Concurrent approved absences exceeding the configurable threshold show a conflict warning to the approver.
  4. Backdated leave beyond window is rejected (`BACKDATE_WINDOW_EXCEEDED`).
  5. Manager can filter calendar by status/leave type.
  6. **(v2/R3)** Backdated leave validates against the correct leave-year balance per the type's `year_basis`.
- **Business Rules:** Backdated leave still validates balance/reservation for the relevant leave-year; conflict threshold advisory (does not auto-block) but recorded; calendar respects org-unit row-level scope; thresholds/windows from `module_config`.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

### FR-15 — Leave-Year Close: Carry-Forward, Lapse & HPL Conversion
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin
- **User Story:** As an HR Admin, I want to close the leave year, carrying forward eligible balances, lapsing excess, and converting per policy, with a dry-run before committing.
- **Description:** Year-close job processes each employee's balances per policy and **per leave-type `year_basis`**: compute carry-forward (capped), lapse excess, convert (e.g. EL→HPL) where configured, post opening balances for the new year — all via ledger entries; supports SIMULATED dry-run with report before COMMIT.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. SIMULATED run produces a report (per employee: carried/lapsed/converted/opening) without writing balances.
  2. COMMITTED run writes `CARRY_FORWARD`, `LAPSE`, `HPL_CONVERSION`, and `OPENING` ledger entries atomically per employee.
  3. Carry-forward respects `carry_forward_cap`; excess lapses per `lapse_rule`.
  4. New leave-year `leave_balances` rows are created with correct opening balances and reset `version`.
  5. A committed year cannot be re-committed (`YEAR_ALREADY_CLOSED`).
  6. **(v2)** Ordering is pinned: encashment-before-lapse, then carry-forward, then opening; documented and deterministic.
- **Business Rules:** EL excess beyond CF cap lapses; CL typically lapses fully (no CF); HPL may have no-lapse; close is irreversible except via maker-checker adjustment; run is idempotent per (year, scope); accrual (FR-11) and close ordering vs Jan/Jul EL credit pinned.
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-16 — Leave Encashment (In-Service, LTC & On Retirement)
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), HR/Authority (approve), Payroll (settle)
- **User Story:** As an employee (or retiree), I want to encash eligible leave so I receive payment for unused balance per policy, with retirement encashment correctly making up the 300-day cap from EL and HPL.
- **Description:** Submit encashment for encashable types within caps; on approval, debit ledger (`ENCASHMENT`) and post amount to the payroll feed; **retirement encashment encashes EL up to cap then HPL cash-equivalent to make up the statutory ceiling (R5)**; **LTC encashment follows the 10-EL-days-per-block / 60-career-day rule (R12)**; retirement integrates with M11.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. In-service encashment allowed only for `is_encashable` types within `encashment_cap_days` and `min_balance_for_encash`.
  2. Approval debits `ENCASHMENT` ledger entry and creates a payroll-feed amount.
  3. **(v2/R5)** RETIREMENT encashment computes `el_days_component` (EL to cap) then `hpl_days_component` (HPL cash-equivalent) to reach `retirement_encash_cap_days` (e.g. 300); HPL is encashable at retirement only (`is_encashable_on_retirement`).
  4. **(v2/R12)** LTC encashment caps at 10 EL days per LTC block and 60 EL days over career; linked via `ltc_block_ref`; exceeding → `LTC_BLOCK_EXHAUSTED`.
  5. Estimated amount shown (M10 computes final); insufficient/over-cap requests rejected.
- **Business Rules:** EL retirement encashment + HPL make-up combined ≤ `retirement_encash_cap_days`; in-service LTC linkage required for LTC type; settlement marks `SETTLED` after payroll ack.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

### FR-17 — Attendance & Leave → Payroll (LWP) Feed + Locked-Period Adjustments
- **Module:** Integration
- **Primary Role(s):** System (generate), Payroll Officer (reconcile)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want an accurate per-period feed of LWP, half-pay, paid-OT, present units, and encashment — with locked periods corrected only via next-period adjustments — so payroll computes pay correctly without retroactive drift.
- **Description:** For each pay period, aggregate per-employee LWP days, half-pay days (HPL), paid-OT minutes, **`present_units` (from allocations, R2)**, and encashment amounts into `payroll_attendance_feed`; expose to M10 with ack handshake; **lock the period after export and route any later correction to `payroll_feed_adjustments` in the next open period (R6)**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Feed generated per `pay_period` aggregates LWP, half-pay, paid-OT, present_units, encashment per employee.
  2. LWP derived from `ABSENT`/LWP-type allocations; half-pay from HPL leave; present_units from present-counting allocations.
  3. **(v2/R6)** After EXPORTED, `is_locked=true`; later corrections create a `payroll_feed_adjustments` row in the next open period — the locked feed is never overwritten.
  4. M10 ack updates status to `ACKED`; failures set `FAILED` with retry.
  5. Feed reconciles to attendance_daily allocations + leave ledger for the period.
- **Business Rules:** Present-counting statuses: PRESENT, WFH, ON_DUTY, ON_LEAVE (paid), HALF_DAY (0.5 via allocation); LWP/absent reduce pay; period lock aligns with FR-01/02/05/13 adjustment behaviour.
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-18 — Mobile/Web Self-Service Surface & Notification Triggers
- **Module:** Integration / Self-Service
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee, Manager
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want a mobile and web self-service surface to punch, apply for leave, check balances and forecasts, and receive timely notifications about my requests.
- **Description:** Unified self-service surface (web + mobile) exposing punch (with consent/fallback), leave apply/cancel, balance & ledger & **what-if forecast (FR-23)**, comp-off wallet, team calendar (managers), approvals inbox (with **delegation**), and consent management; every lifecycle event triggers a `notifications` entry.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Employee can punch, apply/cancel leave, view balance/ledger/forecast, and view request status from mobile and web.
  2. Manager can approve/reject from the inbox on mobile and web; delegated items are clearly labelled.
  3. Each state transition (submitted, recommended, approved, rejected, cancelled, low-balance, accrual-credited, comp-off-expiring, regularisation-decided, **anomaly-flagged, delegation-active, return-to-work-due**) emits a notification.
  4. Notifications respect user channel preferences and are recorded in `notifications`.
  5. Surface is WCAG 2.1 AA compliant and responsive.
- **Business Rules:** Notifications async, non-blocking, retried; sensitive details minimised in push payloads (deep-link); escalation reminder + auto-delegation if an approval task is pending beyond SLA (FR-19).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | notifications | Outbound ledger |
  | leave_applications, attendance_punches, comp_off_ledger, regularisation_requests, approval_delegations, punch_anomaly_reviews | Event sources |

  | GET | /api/v1/atl/approvals/inbox | Pending approvals (incl. delegated) |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/notifications?status= | Notifications |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Mobile-first dashboard: balance cards, what-if forecast, quick-punch, apply-leave CTA, pending-approvals badge; in-app notification center; deep links; consent/fallback management.
- **Edge Cases:** Offline mobile (queued actions); duplicate notification suppression; channel preference off (in-app fallback); SLA escalation to delegate/next approver.

### FR-19 — Approval Delegation & Out-of-Office Routing *(v2 new — R11)*
- **Module:** Integration / Workflow
- **Primary Role(s):** Manager/Approver (set), HR (administer)
- **User Story:** As a manager going on leave, I want to delegate my approval authority so leave/regularisation/OT requests for my team are not jammed while I am away.
- **Description:** Approvers (or HR on their behalf) define a delegation to another qualified approver for a date range and/or on SLA breach; the workflow engine auto-routes pending and incoming approval tasks to the delegate within scope.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. An approver can create a delegation with delegate, scope, request types, and date window.
  2. During an active delegation, new and pending approval tasks in scope route to the delegate.
  3. On SLA breach (if `auto_on_sla_breach`), the task auto-routes to the delegate even without a date-window delegation.
  4. A delegate who is the applicant is rejected (`DELEGATE_IS_APPLICANT`); no delegate available on a jammed queue raises `NO_DELEGATE_AVAILABLE` and escalates to HR.
  5. Delegations are revocable and auto-expire at `to_date`.
- **Business Rules:** Delegate must hold an approver role within scope; segregation of duties preserved (delegate ≠ applicant, maker ≠ checker); delegation recorded in `audit_log`.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | approval_delegations | Delegation record |
  | workflow_tasks | Re-routing target |
  | users | Delegator/delegate |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |

  | POST | /api/v1/atl/delegations/{id}/revoke | Revoke |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/delegations?delegatorId= | List |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** "Out of office / delegate approvals" panel with delegate picker, scope, dates; inbox shows delegated items with origin badge.
- **Edge Cases:** Overlapping delegations; delegate also absent (chained/escalation to HR); delegation during pending tasks; revocation mid-window.
- **LLD:**

### FR-20 — Time-Fraud & Punch Anomaly Detection & Review *(v2 new — R10)*
- **Module:** Integration / Governance
- **Primary Role(s):** System (detect), Anomaly Reviewer/HR (review)
- **User Story:** As HR/Security, I want suspicious punches automatically flagged and reviewed so buddy-punching and spoofing do not corrupt attendance or payroll.
- **Description:** Screen each accepted punch (FR-03) for anomalies — impossible travel between consecutive punches, duplicate same-second punches, geo mismatch, low liveness, device-binding mismatch — and open a `punch_anomaly_reviews` case for reviewer disposition before the punch contributes to a locked payroll feed.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Punches matching anomaly rules are stored `FLAGGED_FOR_REVIEW` and a review case is opened.
  2. A reviewer (≠ punch owner) can confirm valid, confirm fraud, or escalate.
  3. `CONFIRMED_FRAUD` excludes the punch from attendance computation and notifies HR/Security.
  4. `CONFIRMED_VALID` releases the punch for normal FR-04 processing.
  5. Anomaly cases unresolved before period lock are surfaced in the payroll reconciliation screen.
- **Business Rules:** Detection thresholds (`IMPOSSIBLE_TRAVEL` speed, liveness min) configurable via `module_config`; optional liveness/photo-on-punch enforced per device capability; device-to-employee binding checked for `EMPLOYEE_BOUND` devices.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | punch_anomaly_reviews | Review lifecycle |
  | attendance_punches | Flagged source |
  | attendance_devices | Binding/liveness capability |
  | workflow_instances | Review chain |

  |---|---|---|
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/anomalies?status= | List flagged punches |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/anomalies/{id}/decision | Confirm valid/fraud/escalate |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Anomaly review queue with punch detail, map, photo, liveness score, consecutive-punch travel calc; disposition actions; SoD lock preventing self-review.
- **Edge Cases:** False-positive impossible-travel across adjacent geofences; device clock skew causing duplicate-second; liveness failure on poor lighting; reviewer = owner blocked.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `AnomalyScreener`, `AnomalyReviewService`, `WorkflowEngineAdapter` |
  | Backend Flow | On punch ingest screen → if anomaly INSERT review + flag punch → reviewer disposition → release/exclude → notify |

### FR-21 — DPDP Biometric/Geo Consent, Lawful Basis & Non-Biometric Fallback *(v2 new — R9)*
- **Module:** Governance / Privacy
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (consent), HR/DPO (govern), SysAdmin (config)
- **User Story:** As a data principal and as a enterprise data fiduciary, we want biometric/geo capture to have a recorded lawful basis, captured consent, a non-biometric fallback, and an explicit retention/purge schedule, so attendance is DPDP-Act-2023 compliant.
- **Description:** Record per-employee lawful basis (statutory duty / consent / contract), capture consent for biometric/geo/photo, provide an alternative `fallback_method` (RFID/manual/OTP) for non-enrolled or refusing employees, declare biometric-template storage location, and enforce a retention/purge schedule for punches/geo/leave records.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Each employee has a `biometric_consents` record with a lawful basis before biometric/geo capture is permitted.
  2. Consent can be granted or withdrawn; withdrawal engages the `fallback_method` for future punches.
  3. A biometric/geo punch without a valid governing basis is rejected with `CONSENT_REQUIRED` and the employee is offered fallback.
  4. Biometric template storage location is declared per device (`template_storage`) and surfaced to the DPO.
  5. A retention/purge job removes biometric/geo/punch data past `retention_until` per the schedule (App. E); leave records retained per statutory schedule.
  6. DPO can audit lawful basis, consent status, and purge execution.
- **Business Rules:** Mandatory biometric attendance requires `STATUTORY_DUTY` or explicit `CONSENT`; non-enrolled employees must always have a working fallback; geo minimised and purpose-bound; no PII in push payloads.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | biometric_consents | Consent/lawful basis/fallback/retention |
  | attendance_devices | Template storage declaration |
  | attendance_punches | Consent linkage; purge target |
  | documents | Signed consent artefact |

  | GET | /api/v1/atl/consents?employeeId= | View governance status |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/retention/purge-run | Execute purge (HR/DPO) |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Consent management screen (lawful basis, capture types, fallback election, signed-consent upload); DPO governance dashboard (consent coverage, template-storage map, purge log).
- **Edge Cases:** Employee refuses biometric (fallback mandatory); consent withdrawn mid-day; device storing templates server-side requiring encryption; purge of records still under legal hold; statutory-duty basis overriding consent withdrawal for mandatory attendance.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `ConsentService`, `LawfulBasisResolver`, `FallbackEnroller`, `RetentionPurgeJob` |
  | Backend Flow | Resolve lawful basis at punch (FR-03 gate) → enforce consent/fallback → schedule retention → purge past `retention_until` |
  | Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE consent; DELETE/anonymise expired biometric/geo data |

### FR-22 — Leave Entitlement Counters for Sanction-Based Leave *(v2 new — R7, R14)*
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** System/HR (maintain), Employee (consume via FR-12)
- **User Story:** As HR, I want sanction-based leave (Maternity, Paternity, CCL, Study, Sabbatical, LWP) governed by career/event quotas and eligibility predicates rather than a phantom accruable balance, so statutory limits are enforced cleanly.
- **Description:** Maintain `leave_entitlements` counters (career/event/annual quota, consumed, remaining) and eligibility predicates (surviving children, child age, gender) for sanction-based types; FR-12 validates against these instead of a positive balance, while the ledger still records informational `AVAIL` entries — removing the `is_accruable=false` + negative-balance special case.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Each sanction-based type has an entitlement counter per employee (career quota e.g. CCL 730, event cap e.g. Maternity 180).
  2. Applying consumes `remaining_days`; exceeding raises `ENTITLEMENT_EXCEEDED`.
  3. **(v2/R14)** Eligibility predicates (e.g. ≤2 surviving children for CCL/Maternity, child age ≤18/22-if-disabled) are checked against `employee_dependents`; failure raises `INELIGIBLE_DEPENDENT`.
  4. The leave ledger records an informational `AVAIL` entry for traceability without a negative-balance exception.
  5. Counters are auditable and adjustable via maker-checker.
- **Business Rules:** Career quotas persist across leave years; event quotas reset per qualifying event; eligibility predicate stored as JSONB and evaluated at apply-time; LWP tracked for service/pay impact.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | leave_entitlements | Quota/eligibility counter |
  | employee_dependents | Eligibility source (R14) |
  | leave_balance_ledger | Informational AVAIL |
  | leave_types | `is_sanction_based` link |

  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/entitlements?employeeId= | View counters |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/entitlements/adjust | Maker-checker adjustment |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Entitlement panel showing quota/consumed/remaining and eligibility status; apply wizard surfaces remaining quota and eligibility check for sanction types.
- **Edge Cases:** Child crossing age cap mid-application; additional surviving child changing eligibility; career quota near exhaustion; event window expiry; disabled-child extended cap.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `EntitlementService`, `EligibilityEvaluator`, `LeaveLedgerService` |
  | Backend Flow | On sanction apply → evaluate predicate vs dependents → check remaining → reserve/consume counter → ledger informational AVAIL |

### FR-23 — Best-in-Class Absence Features (Forecast, Mass-Leave, Blackout, Return-to-Work) *(v2 new — Proponent)*
- **Module:** Leave Management / Self-Service
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (forecast), HR (mass-leave/blackout/return-to-work)
- **User Story:** As an organisation, we want modern absence capabilities — balance what-if forecasting, organisation-wide shutdown/mass-leave, leave blackout/freeze windows, and a return-to-work workflow after long medical leave — to match best-in-class HCM suites.
- **Description:** (a) **What-if forecast:** project a leave balance to a future date factoring scheduled accruals, approved future leave, and lapse. (b) **Mass-leave/shutdown:** HR applies a leave/holiday to an org-unit cohort in one action (e.g. office shutdown). (c) **Blackout/freeze:** configure windows (via `module_config`) where specified leave types are blocked. (d) **Return-to-work:** after long medical leave, require a fitness/return-to-work clearance before attendance resumes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Employee can request a balance forecast for a future date; the projection shows accruals, committed leave, and lapse risk.
  2. HR can execute a mass-leave/shutdown for a cohort, creating per-employee applications/holidays atomically with a summary report.
  3. Applications for blocked types in an active blackout window are rejected with `BLACKOUT_PERIOD`.
  4. Long-medical leave (configured types) sets `return_to_work_status=PENDING`; attendance for post-leave days is gated until `CLEARED` with a fitness certificate (M13).
  5. All four features respect RBAC, org-unit scope, and audit.
- **Business Rules:** Forecast is read-only and uses the same accrual/rounding engine (FR-11); mass-leave honours per-employee balance/entitlement (skips ineligible with a report); blackout windows are scoped and effective-dated; return-to-work clearance routed via workflow.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | module_config | Blackout/mass-leave/forecast config |
  | leave_applications | Mass-leave + return-to-work status |
  | leave_balances, leave_balance_ledger | Forecast source |

  | POST | /api/v1/atl/mass-leave | Org-wide shutdown/mass apply |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/leave-applications/{id}/return-to-work | Clear RTW |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Forecast slider/date-picker with projected balance chart; mass-leave console with cohort selector, type, dates and dry-run summary; blackout config in policy admin; return-to-work task in HR inbox with certificate upload.
- **Edge Cases:** Forecast across year-close boundary; mass-leave with some ineligible employees (partial apply + report); overlapping blackout windows; return-to-work overdue; forecast vs reserved balance.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `BalanceForecastService`, `MassLeaveService`, `BlackoutValidator`, `ReturnToWorkService` |
  | Backend Flow | Forecast: replay accrual/lapse to asOf (read-only). Mass-leave: cohort resolve → per-employee FR-12 (txn, skip ineligible) → report. Blackout: FR-12 validation gate. RTW: workflow → CLEARED → enable attendance |
  | Data Operations | Read-only forecast; INSERT cohort applications; UPDATE return_to_work_status |

- Dates `DD-MMM-YYYY`; balances with one-decimal precision; INR with locale formatting.
- WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, focus order, contrast, ARIA on calendars/grids.
- Toasts for action results; modals for destructive (cancel, year-close commit, mass-leave, purge) with explicit confirmation.
- All list/grid views paginated (max 100) with filters and CSV export where applicable.
- i18n-ready (English + regional language); no hardcoded strings.

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data migration
| Step | Source | Target | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Leave types & policies | Legacy registers / rules | leave_types, leave_accrual_policies | Statutory caps, commuted-link, sandwich/year-basis verified |
| Sanction entitlements | Service records | leave_entitlements | Career/event quotas + dependents reconciled |
| Opening leave balances | Legacy ledgers/spreadsheets | leave_balance_ledger (OPENING) + leave_balances (version 0) | Reconciliation = 0 mismatch |
| Holiday calendars | Office circulars | holiday_calendars/holidays | Per-location completeness |
| Roster/shift assignments | HR records | shifts/rosters | No overlaps; date-anchor set |
| Devices & consent | IT inventory / HR | attendance_devices, biometric_consents | Geofence/binding/template-storage + lawful basis recorded |
| Module config | Legacy parameters | module_config | All Appendix-C tunables migrated |
| Historical attendance (optional) | Biometric exports | attendance_punches/daily/allocations | Spot reconciliation |

### 13.2 Cutover & rollout
- Phased: configuration (types/policies/holidays/shifts/module_config) → entitlement + balance migration with reconciliation sign-off → device integration + consent capture → pilot org unit → org-wide.
- Parallel run for one leave cycle and one payroll cycle before decommissioning legacy.
- Go/No-Go gate: 0 reconciliation mismatches; SR posting and payroll feed (incl. adjustments) validated end-to-end; consent coverage ≥ 100% or fallback enrolled.

### 13.3 Rollback
- Migration executed in reversible batches; ledger OPENING entries tagged with migration run id for clean reversal; feature flags per FR.

### 13.4 Launch readiness checklist
Balances + entitlements reconciled; policies signed off by HR/legal; commuted/sandwich/rounding configured; SR (M04) and payroll (M10) handshakes + adjustments tested; consent/lawful-basis + retention schedule signed off by DPO; anomaly review queue staffed; notifications verified; RBAC scopes validated; accessibility audit passed; runbooks and on-call in place.

## 15. Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Accrual | Periodic crediting of leave per policy, with defined rounding/proration. |
| Allocation (sub-day) | A fractional portion of a day assigned a status; allocations for a day sum ≤ 1.0. |
| Carry-forward | Balance carried into the next leave year, subject to cap. |
| Comp-off | Compensatory leave earned for OT/holiday work; balance held solely in `comp_off_ledger`. |
| Commuted Leave | HPL converted to full-pay (medical) leave; availing 1 day debits 2 HPL days (`debit_ratio` 2.0 against HPL). |
| Consent (DPDP) | Recorded lawful basis/consent for biometric/geo capture; withdrawable, with non-biometric fallback. |

### Appendix B — Attendance status precedence, weekly-off legend & date derivation
- **Rollup precedence:** `ON_LEAVE` > `HOLIDAY` > `WEEKLY_OFF` > `WFH`/`ON_DUTY` > punch-derived (`PRESENT`/`HALF_DAY`/`ABSENT`/`MISSING_PUNCH`). The `attendance_daily.status` is the highest-precedence allocation; `present_units` is the sum of present-counting allocation fractions (R2).
- **Weekly-off legend:** `SUN`=Sunday; `SAT2`=2nd Saturday of the month; `SAT4`=4th Saturday of the month (i.e. nth Saturday, not date-of-month). *(Outsider clarification)*
- **Punch→attendance_date derivation (R16):** the applicable shift's `date_anchor_rule` governs bucketing. `PUNCH_LOCAL_DATE` = local date of the punch in `display_timezone`; `SHIFT_START_LOCAL_DATE` = the local date the night shift started (so a 22:00–06:00 NIGHT-A shift attributes the 02:00 punch to the prior calendar day). **DST assumption:** IST (`Asia/Kolkata`) has no DST; multi-timezone deployments must revisit bucketing — declared as an explicit, revisitable assumption rather than "not applicable".

### Appendix C — Key configurable parameters (held in `module_config`, scoped & effective-dated)
| Parameter (config_key) | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| REGULARISATION_WINDOW_DAYS | 15 days | |
| REGULARISATION_LIMIT | 3 / month | |
| BACKDATE_WINDOW_DAYS | 30 days | |
| COMPOFF_VALIDITY_DAYS | 90 days | |
| RH_CAP | 2 | Overrides calendar default |
| CONFLICT_THRESHOLD_PCT | 30% | Team concurrent-absence advisory |
| EL_CF_CAP_DAYS | 300 days | |
| EL_RETIREMENT_ENCASH_CAP_DAYS | 300 days | Combined EL+HPL make-up (R5) |
| LTC_BLOCK_DAYS / LTC_CAREER_CAP_DAYS | 10 / 60 days | LTC encashment (R12) |
| CLOCK_SKEW_MIN | ±5 min | |
| RESERVATION_TTL_MIN | 4320 (72h) | Auto-release undecided reservation (R1) |
| IMPOSSIBLE_TRAVEL_KMH | 900 km/h | Anomaly threshold (R10) |
| LIVENESS_MIN_SCORE | 0.80 | Anomaly threshold (R10) |
| ACCRUAL_ROUNDING_MODE | NEAREST_HALF_CARRY | Per-policy override (R3) |
| BLACKOUT_PERIOD | (none) | Structured `{from,to,leaveTypes,scope}` (Proponent) |

**Worked proration + rounding example (R3):** Employee joins 2026-04-16 under EL `HALF_YEARLY` accrual of 15 days for the Jan–Jun cycle, `proration_method=DAYS_IN_SERVICE_OVER_CYCLE`, `rounding_mode=NEAREST_HALF_CARRY`. Days in service Apr-16→Jun-30 = 76 of 181 cycle days. Raw accrual = 15 × 76/181 = 6.30 days. Rounded to nearest 0.5 = 6.5; fractional remainder (6.30 − 6.5 = −0.20) is carried as a `remainder_carry` into the next cycle so cumulative accrual never drifts. Ledger posts `ACCRUAL +6.5`.

### Appendix D — Referenced modules
M01-EPM, M04-LSR, M10-PAY, M11-PEN, M12-SR, M13-DMS, M14-DAS, and shared workflow/notification/audit platform per `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`.

### Appendix E — DPDP Data Retention & Purge Schedule (R9)
| Data class | Retention | Purge mechanism | Lawful basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Biometric templates | Active employment + 0 days post-exit (templates not retained after separation) | Device/server template wipe on exit | Statutory duty / consent |
| Geo-location of punches | 180 days rolling | Anonymise lat/long after 180 days; keep punch fact | Purpose-bound (attendance) |
| Punch photos (liveness) | 90 days (or until anomaly case closed) | Delete from M13 after window | Anti-fraud |
| Raw punches | 3 years (statutory audit) | Archive then purge | Statutory audit |
| Attendance daily/allocations | 8 years | Archive | Service record support |
| Leave applications & ledger | Permanent / per service-register statutory schedule | Retained (immutable) | Statutory service record |
| Consent records | Employment + 8 years | Archive | Accountability |
| Anomaly review records | 8 years | Archive | Audit/fraud |

Purge runs (FR-21) honour legal holds (`PURGE_BLOCKED_LEGAL_HOLD`) and are logged to `audit_log`; the DPO signs off the schedule at launch and annually.
