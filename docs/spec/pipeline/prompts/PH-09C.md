/goal
  objective: Take PS11 pension computation to BRD depth. The audit found the scheme field is STORED BUT NEVER USED —
    one flat formula regardless of scheme. Implement real scheme BRANCHING and benefit engines: OPS (50% of
    emoluments per pen_pension_limit_rules min/max), NPS default-benefit path, UPS assured-payout path, and the
    under-10-years SERVICE_GRATUITY route (no pension). Add commutation via pen_commutation_factors lookup keyed by
    age-next-birthday with max-fraction enforcement, reduction, and restoration date = reduction + 15 years; family
    pension with normal and enhanced-window rates from pen_family_pension_rates; gratuity by type
    (RETIREMENT_GRATUITY / DEATH_GRATUITY / SERVICE_GRATUITY) with slabs and pen_gratuity_ceilings clamping; and
    provisional pension (Rule 9) via pen_provisional_pension_records with DCRG fully withheld until the PS09
    proceeding concludes.

  constraints:
    - Scheme branching must be real: identical inputs under OPS vs NPS vs UPS must produce different, scheme-correct
      outputs; a benefit requested under the wrong scheme fails with ERR-PS11-SCHEME-MISMATCH. Never default silently.
    - Qualifying service below the pension threshold routes to SERVICE_GRATUITY (no pension), per pen_pension_limit_rules.
    - Commutation: fraction above the statutory max throws ERR-PS11-COMMUTATION-LIMIT; the factor is a lookup in
      pen_commutation_factors by age-next-birthday (missing row -> ERR-PS11-FACTOR-NOT-FOUND, never interpolate);
      persist commuted value, reduced pension, and restoration_date = reduction start + 15 years.
    - Family pension: enhanced rate only inside the BRD window (in-service vs after-retirement paths), normal rate
      after; rates come from pen_family_pension_rates, not literals.
    - Gratuity: type-specific slabs; result clamped to the effective pen_gratuity_ceilings row — clamping recorded.
    - Rule 9: while a PS09 proceeding is open, only provisional pension via pen_provisional_pension_records with DCRG
      withheld; release paths follow conclusion outcome.
    - Deterministic integer paise/cents money math; rounding only via pen_rounding_rules.
    - Parameterised queries; transactions for multi-step writes; no console.log; no stack traces in responses.
    - Do NOT weaken any oracle under docs/spec/pipeline/checks/**; do NOT touch phases.yaml, .state/, or approvals/.

  evidence_required:
    - apps/api/src/modules/ps11/** scheme-branched engines naming the BRD entities/codes above
    - apps/api/test/*.test.cjs: scheme divergence, factor lookup, commutation limit, ceiling clamp, Rule 9 tests
    - `bash docs/spec/pipeline/checks/ph-09c.sh` GREEN (external oracle; not self-certified)
  escalate_when:
    - A statutory factor/rate/ceiling value has no grounded source in BRD/DDL/seed data (never invent statutory numbers).
    - The BRD leaves a scheme rule genuinely ambiguous after one resolution attempt — surface the precise question.
    - The PS09 linkage needed for Rule 9 does not expose proceeding state (raise a cross-module gap, do not stub silently).
