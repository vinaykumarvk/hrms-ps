# Employee Transfer, Relieving and Joining Workflow — HRMS Module BRD (v2.0)

**Module code:** M05-TRJ
**Program:** Enterprise HRMS — "PeopleGov / HRMS Suite"
**Document version:** v2.0 (revised — incorporates Adversarial Council adopted improvements)
**Supersedes:** v1.0 (`docs/brd/v1/M05-transfer-relieving-joining-workflow.md`)
**Status:** Baseline for build (parallel-agent ready; contracts re-frozen post-council)
**Owns:** Transfer lifecycle entities (requests, orders, clearances, charge handovers, joining reports, deputations, drives, preferences, transfer policy rules) **plus** SR outbox, representations/stay-orders, counselling sessions, quarter/estate retention, gapless order-number sequences, order acknowledgements, and drive-scoped vacancy reservations.
**Reuses (does not redefine):** `employees`, `users`, `org_units`, `designations`, `roles`, `permissions`, `service_register_events`, `documents`, `notifications`, `audit_log`, `workflow_instances`, `workflow_tasks` — all per `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Employee Transfer, Relieving and Joining Workflow module (M05-TRJ) digitises the **end-to-end employee mobility lifecycle** of a enterprise/public-sector organisation: from the **initiation of a transfer** (by request, administrative decision, mutual exchange, deputation, or promotion-linkage), through **transfer-order generation, statutory approval, and proof-of-service to the employee**, **relieving at the source office** (departmental no-dues/clearance, handover of charge, last-working-day, relieving order), the **transfer-in-transit / joining-time period treated as continuous paid service**, and finally **joining at the destination office** (joining report, charge assumption, confirmation of joining date, inter-se seniority sequencing). Every materially significant event is posted as a statutory **Service Register (SR) event** to the Digital SR (M12), and the relieving/joining events explicitly **assert no break in qualifying service**.

The module replaces a paper-driven, multi-office, hand-carried "Last Pay Certificate + relieving letter + joining report" process that today causes pay gaps, disputed seniority dates, lost no-dues forms, and unauditable transit periods. It establishes a **single auditable system of record** for who is posted where, from when, under what order, in whose custody during transit, and with what dues outstanding.

### 1.2 Business context (public-sector statutory)
Transfers in enterprise are **regulated administrative actions**. They are constrained by transfer policy (minimum tenure at a post, transfer ban/freeze periods such as election model-code-of-conduct windows, protected categories such as spouse-posting, medical grounds, single-parent, differently-abled, near-retirement protection), by **vacancy and sanctioned-strength** discipline (the authoritative source of which is M01/M06, **read-through** by M05, not duplicated), and by **due process** (competent/appointing authority sanction, proof of service on the employee, transfer counselling for cadre drives). Relieving and joining have **pay and seniority consequences**: the date of relieving and date of joining define the **transit period**, which is **paid joining time / duty** (not dead time), and which fixes joining-time admissibility, pay continuity, and the **seniority/service continuity** recorded in the Digital SR. Transfers are routinely contested through representations and court/tribunal **stay orders**, and may end in **non-joining/abandonment**; all of these are first-class, modelled states. Errors are statutorily and financially material.

### 1.3 Scope summary
In scope: transfer request/initiation across all transfer types; eligibility & policy enforcement; counselling/preference capture **including interactive counselling sessions**; vacancy-driven and bulk transfer drives with an explicit vacancy lifecycle; transfer-order generation with **gapless statutory numbering**, approval, **proof-of-service & acknowledgement**, amendment, cancellation and revocation; **representation / stay-order / retention holds**; relieving (no-dues clearance **with SLA-bounded escalation and deemed clearance**, charge handover **with handover-under-protest**, relieving order **with deemed-relief Authority power**, last working day); **service-continuity and in-transit custody management**; joining (joining report, charge assumption, **inter-se seniority sequencing**, **non-joining/abandonment resolution**); deputation & repatriation; **enterprise quarters/estate retention & licence-fee recovery**; SR-event posting via a fully-specified transactional outbox; module notifications, reporting and analytics.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere, integrated): the canonical employee master (M01), promotion decisioning and seniority computation (M06 — M05 consumes promotion-linked transfer triggers, reads sanctioned strength/seniority, and writes posting changes + joining-sequence facts), payroll Last Pay Certificate generation, **joining-time pay / transfer entitlement computation**, pay disbursement and licence-fee recovery (M10 — M05 raises the LPC trigger, the **pay-continuity + entitlement** signal, and the licence-fee-recovery signal), pension/retirement (M11), the Digital SR ledger itself (M12 — M05 is a writer), disciplinary proceedings for abandonment (M09 — M05 raises the trigger), and the document object store (M13 — M05 stores order/clearance PDFs there, with a sensitive-category access class for medical/spouse/compassionate evidence).

### 1.4 Primary outcomes & KPIs

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited platform behaviours, applied in this module)
- **Maker-checker workflow** via the shared workflow engine for every order, relieving, and joining action.
- **Segregation of duties:** initiator ≠ approver; transferee may never approve own transfer or self-clear a no-dues item; clearance officer ≠ transferee; relinquisher ≠ acceptor; the Authority granting a forced action is recorded and may not be the transferee.
- **Single state authority:** all `transfer_orders.status` transitions are mediated by one **`TransferOrderStateService`** (§16.6); no other component writes the column.
- **Row-level scoping** by `org_unit_id`: source-office HR sees relieving; destination-office HR sees joining; a transferee in transit is visible to both and owned by the **in-transit custodian** (FR-TRJ-015).
- **Immutable audit** (`audit_log`) on every state transition, with before/after snapshots; **forced actions, overrides, deemed-clearances, and sensitive-document access additionally write a dedicated audit reason + actor**.
- **Soft delete** (`is_deleted`) on transactional entities except append-only ledgers/SR/outbox/choice logs.
- **Document binding:** every generated order and signed clearance/handover/joining artefact is stored in M13 `documents` and referenced by ID; medical/spouse/compassionate evidence uses the **sensitive access class**.
- **i18n / locale:** dates `DD-MMM-YYYY`; UTC storage; INR money; bilingual order templates.
- **Pagination:** all list endpoints cursor/page-limit, hard max page size 100.

### 2.4 Assumptions & constraints
- **Sanctioned strength / vacancy data is owned by M01/M06 and read-through by M05**; M05 stores only **drive-scoped reservation** state (`vacancy_reservations`). If the strength service is unavailable, vacancy-driven flows degrade to manual destination entry with a warning (no hard block) and a reconciliation flag.
- Transfer policy parameters (tenure thresholds, ban calendars, protected categories, clearance SLAs, joining-time distance bands) are configurable master data maintained by System Administrators and Transfer Authorities; the module ships seeded defaults.
- A transfer always has exactly one source `org_unit` and one destination `org_unit` (deputation destination may be an external organisation modelled as an `org_unit` of type `EXTERNAL`).
- "Office" = an `org_unit` of a transferable type; clearance departments are configured per office, and an office may legitimately have **fewer than the seven default departments** (only configured departments generate clearance items).
- A **successor may not exist**; charge may be handed to a link officer, the office (custody-of-office), or held under protest (FR-TRJ-007/016).
- The **transit period is paid duty/leave**, not unpaid; pay is continuous with a custody handoff (FR-TRJ-015).
- A working-day/holiday **calendar service exists and is regional-calendar aware**; M05 does not silently assume Sat/Sun + national holidays (§8.3, FR-TRJ-009).

### 5.5 Enum & reference catalog

**Canonical taxonomy note `[v2]`** — three **orthogonal axes** (resolves enum redundancy, Risk 17):
- **`transfer_type` = the mechanism** by which mobility occurs.
- **`ground` = the justification** for it.
- **`priority_category` = the statutory protection** the employee holds.
A request carries one value on each axis. `TRANSFER_ON_REQUEST` is **collapsed** into `transfer_type=REQUEST` (the "on request" sense is conveyed by `request_origin=SELF`).

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `transfer_type` (mechanism) | `REQUEST`, `ADMINISTRATIVE`, `MUTUAL`, `DEPUTATION`, `PROMOTION_LINKED`, `COMPASSIONATE` |

### 5.6 Data integrity rules
1. **One active SUBSTANTIVE transition per employee `[v2 reframed]`:** an employee may have only one `transfer_order` with `order_class=SUBSTANTIVE` in a non-terminal status (`PUBLISHED`→`JOINED`) at a time. `ADDITIONAL_CHARGE`, `DEPUTATION`, and `REPATRIATION` order classes may legitimately co-exist with a substantive posting and with each other; a second **substantive** issuance is `CONFLICT (409, TRJ_ACTIVE_TRANSFER_EXISTS)`.
2. **Relieving precondition:** a `relieving_order` may reach `ISSUED` only if its `clearance_checklist.status ∈ {CLEARED, CLEARED_WITH_DUES, CLEARED_WITH_DEEMED}` and `has_outstanding_dues` either false or `dues_recovery_ref` present — **or** a `deemed_relief` forced action is recorded (FR-TRJ-016).
3. **Joining precondition:** a `joining_report` may reach `JOINED_CONFIRMED` only if linked `transfer_order.status = IN_TRANSIT` — except `JOINING_WITHOUT_RELIEF` exceptions explicitly flagged.
4. **Date monotonicity:** `order_date ≤ served_on_date ≤ relieve_by_date`; `last_working_day ≥ served_on_date`; `joining_date ≥ last_working_day`; `repatriation_due_date ≥ start_date`; `vacate_by_date ≥ last_working_day`.
5. **Mutual symmetry & coupling `[v2 reframed]`:** a `MUTUAL` request requires a reciprocal request linking `mutual_counterpart_employee_id`; both orders are approved/published **atomically as a pair**, and additionally **relieving and joining are paired-progress guarded** — neither half may reach `JOINED` while the other is still pre-relief; asymmetric completion is `CONFLICT (409, TRJ_MUTUAL_PAIR_BLOCKED)`.
6. **Vacancy lifecycle `[v2]`:** a `vacancy_reservation` moves `RESERVED → VACATED_ON_RELIEF` (source relieved) `→ FILLED_ON_JOIN` (destination joined). Allotment requires a free reservation slot (`vacant_count > 0`) **and a transactional re-check at join time**; double-fill is `CONFLICT (409, TRJ_VACANCY_FULL)`.
7. **Maker ≠ checker & transferee exclusion:** enforced on every approval/clearance/forced-action write; the Authority exercising a forced action is recorded and may not be the transferee.
8. **SR posting completeness via outbox `[v2]`:** on each of order-publish, relieve, and join, exactly one corresponding `sr_outbox` row (idempotency-key unique) must reach `DELIVERED`; failures are retried, dead-lettered after `max_attempts`, and surfaced (FR-TRJ-012).
9. **No orphan clearance:** `clearance_items` exist only with a parent `clearance_checklist`; `total_items` = count of items; only **configured** departments generate items.
10. **SR/append-only immutability:** soft delete is never applied to records posted to SR, to `sr_outbox`, or to `counselling_choices`; such records are cancelled/revoked/compensated with reason, not deleted.
11. **Service continuity `[v2]`:** between `last_working_day` and `joining_date` the employee's pay is **continuous** (a single `PAY_CONTINUITY` signal, not stop+start); the SR `RELIEVED` and `JOINED` events carry `service_continuity_asserted=true` (no break in qualifying service) unless an explicit break (e.g. abandonment) is recorded.
12. **In-transit custody (no dual/zero posting) `[v2]`:** while `transfer_order.status=IN_TRANSIT`, exactly one `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id` is set; M01 `org_unit_id` remains source until join; headcount/budget counts the employee **once**, against the custodian; null or two custodians is `CONFLICT (409, TRJ_DUAL_POSTING_BLOCKED)`.
13. **Strength read-through `[v2]`:** `vacancy_positions.sanctioned_strength_cached`/`filled_count_cached` are caches with `strength_as_of`; they are never written by transactional flows, only by the reconciliation job; allotment decisions read live where possible and fall back to cache with a staleness flag.
14. **Joining-sequence integrity `[v2]`:** concurrent same-cadre/same-post joinings on a date receive distinct `joining_sequence_no` values ordered by `reported_date`/`joining_time` then deterministic `inter_se_tiebreak_key` (`service_no`); the tuple is unique per (`dest_org_unit_id`,`dest_designation_id`,`joining_date`) and exposed to M06.
15. **Proof-of-service precedence `[v2]`:** `relieve_by_date` enforcement and non-compliance escalation reference `served_on_date` (or `DEEMED_SERVED`), never `order_date`; an order may not enter `RELIEVING_IN_PROGRESS` without a `SERVED`/`DEEMED_SERVED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED` acknowledgement row.
16. **Hold supremacy `[v2]`:** an active `STAY_HOLD` (`representation.status=HOLD_ACTIVE`) blocks all forward transitions of the order until vacated; `hold_active=true` mirrors this on `transfer_orders`.
17. **Gapless numbering `[v2]`:** statutory numbers are issued via reserve-then-commit on `order_number_sequences` per (`scope`,`office`,`fiscal_year`); a reserved-but-uncommitted number is either committed or explicitly voided with an audit row; the gap-audit report must show zero unexplained gaps.

### FR-TRJ-001 — Transfer Request Initiation (all types)
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Initiation
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Transferee), Reporting Manager, HR Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** *As an employee or HR officer, I want to initiate a transfer request of any type so that mobility is captured in a structured, auditable way before an order is issued.*
- **Description:** Unified intake for all `transfer_type` values. Self-service employees raise `REQUEST`/`MUTUAL`/`COMPASSIONATE`; managers endorse for reports; HR Admin raises `ADMINISTRATIVE`; the system raises `PROMOTION_LINKED` from an M06 trigger. Captures source, requested destination, ground, supporting documents (M13), **sensitive-ground documents into the M13 sensitive access class** `[v2]`, priority category, and requested effective date. On submission it runs the eligibility/policy engine (FR-TRJ-002) and routes via the workflow engine. Uses the **canonical orthogonal taxonomy** (`transfer_type`/`ground`/`priority_category`, §5.5) `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A request can be created in `DRAFT` and edited until `SUBMITTED`.
  2. `transfer_type` and `request_origin` are mandatory; field combinations validated (`MUTUAL` requires `mutual_counterpart_employee_id`).
  3. On submit, an eligibility check runs, result stored in `eligibility_result`; a `HARD_BLOCK` prevents submission with a clear reason.
  4. A unique `request_no` is generated on first submission.
  5. Documents for `MEDICAL`/`SPOUSE`/`COMPASSIONATE` grounds are mandatory and stored in M13 **with the sensitive access class; `sensitive_ground=true` set and access is logged** `[v2]`.
  6. Every create/submit writes `audit_log` and (on submit) creates a `workflow_instance`.
- **Business Rules:** Employee origin → self only; manager → direct reports; HR Admin → org scope. Promotion-linked requests are system-originated, read-only to employees. A transferee with an active **substantive** order is blocked (5.6-1, reframed) `[v2]`.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | `transfer_requests` | Create/update primary record |
  | `employees` | Validate transferee, source org_unit |

### FR-TRJ-002 — Transfer Policy & Eligibility Validation
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Policy & Eligibility
- **Primary Role(s):** System (engine), HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As the organisation, I want every transfer evaluated against tenure, ban-window, protected-category and sanctioned-strength policy so that no order violates statutory transfer rules.*
- **Description:** Rules engine evaluating a candidate request/order against `transfer_policy_rules` and `transfer_ban_periods`. Produces per-rule verdicts (`PASS`/`WARN`/`BLOCK`/`OVERRIDE_REQUIRED`) and an aggregate (most-restrictive wins). **Sanctioned-strength is read-through from M06/M01, not from a local store** `[v2]`. Overrides gated to Transfer Authority with mandatory justification, captured so that compliance metrics measure **un-overridden** violations `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Engine returns itemised `rule_code`, verdict, message per evaluated rule.
  2. Minimum-tenure computed from current-post DOJ (last `JOINED` order or M01 posting date).
  3. Ban-window check is date-range and org-scope aware, honouring `exception_grounds`.
  4. Sanctioned-strength check blocks allotment when **read-through** `vacant_count = 0` `[v2]`.
  5. Overrides require Transfer Authority + justification, in `audit_log` and `eligibility_result`; the override audit is queryable for the "0% un-overridden violation" KPI `[v2]`.
  6. Engine idempotent and re-runnable; latest result cached.
- **Business Rules:** Protected `MEDICAL`/`SPOUSE`/`COMPASSIONATE` bypass bans only when listed in `exception_grounds`. Near-retirement requires override even for admin transfers. Cooling period triggers `SOFT_WARN`/`BLOCK` per config.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_policy_rules`, `transfer_ban_periods`, `transfer_requests.eligibility_result`, `employees`, `vacancy_positions` (read-through), M06 strength service.
- **API References:**

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Eligibility panel per-rule icon + message; override modal (Authority only) demands justification ≥ 20 chars; strength shown with freshness/`strength_as_of` badge `[v2]`.
- **Edge Cases:** Conflicting rules (most restrictive wins); no current-post date (fallback M01 DOJ); overlapping bans; rule effective-date boundaries; **strength service stale/unavailable → SOFT_WARN with staleness flag** `[v2]`.

### FR-TRJ-003 — Counselling, Vacancy Publication & Preference Capture (batch)
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Counselling & Preferences
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Employee, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want to publish vacancies and let eligible employees record ranked preferences so that batch allotment in a drive is transparent and seniority/merit-based.*
- **Description:** Publishes `vacancy_positions` (strength read-through; geo for Phase-2), opens a preference window, captures ranked preferences, and supports **batch** allotment by `SENIORITY`/`MERIT`/`PREFERENCE`/`MANUAL`. Allotment now writes `vacancy_reservations` (`RESERVED`) rather than mutating a local strength counter `[v2]`. For cadres requiring live allotment, use the interactive session model (FR-TRJ-019). Feeds FR-TRJ-005/004.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Only published, in-scope vacancies are selectable.
  2. Employees add/reorder/delete preferences only within the open window.
  3. Preference ranks unique and contiguous per employee per drive.
  4. Allotment respects `allotment_method`; results create a `vacancy_reservation` (`RESERVED`) and mark `allotted=true` `[v2]`.
  5. Seniority score pulled from M06 at allotment time.
- **Business Rules:** Employee must pass FR-TRJ-002; reservations may not exceed read-through `vacant_count`; manual override by Authority logged. **`COUNSELLING` drives use FR-TRJ-019, not batch allotment** `[v2]`.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_drives`, `transfer_preferences`, `vacancy_positions`, `vacancy_reservations` `[v2]`, `employees`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/vacancies` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/vacancies?published=true` |
  | PUT | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/preferences` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/drives/{id}/allot` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Vacancy list (+ Phase-2 map); drag-to-rank builder with live eligibility; window countdown; allotment results grid.
- **Edge Cases:** Window closed mid-edit; vacancy reserved concurrently; seniority tie (deterministic tiebreak by `service_no`); duplicate preference.

  | Validation | Window dates; rank contiguity; published-only; reservation capacity |
  | Authorization | Vacancies/allot: HR Admin/Authority; prefs: employee (own) |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Drive `OPEN`→`ALLOTTED`; reservations `RESERVED` |
  | Failure Handling | Concurrent allot → row lock + retry; over-capacity → `TRJ_VACANCY_FULL` |

### FR-TRJ-004 — Transfer Order Generation, Gapless Numbering, Approval & Publication
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Approval, Numbering & Order
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want approved requests/allotments converted into a numbered, statutory transfer order and published so that source and destination offices act on a single authoritative document with a gapless statutory number.*
- **Description:** Generates a `transfer_order` (with `order_class` `[v2]`) from an approved request/allotment or direct admin action, routes the approval chain, assigns a **gapless statutory `order_no` via reserve-then-commit on `order_number_sequences`** (per-office/per-year) `[v2]`, renders a bilingual PDF (M13), publishes to both offices, sets `joining_distance_band`/`joining_time_days` (§16.4) and `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id` pre-set for transit `[v2]`, enqueues the **transfer SR event in `sr_outbox`** (FR-TRJ-012), and triggers proof-of-service (FR-TRJ-020). All `status` writes go through `TransferOrderStateService` `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Order created only from an `APPROVED` request, an allotment reservation, or a direct admin action with prior eligibility pass.
  2. Approval enforces maker ≠ checker and transferee exclusion.
  3. On approval, a **gapless** sequential `order_no` is committed (reserve-then-commit; voided reservations audited); an immutable PDF is stored in M13 `[v2]`.
  4. Publication sets `PUBLISHED`, notifies transferee + both offices, enqueues SR posting (outbox) and clearance-checklist creation, and initiates service-of-order (FR-TRJ-020).
  5. Mutual orders approved/published atomically as a pair, recording `mutual_pair_order_id` `[v2]`.
  6. `order_class` is mandatory; `SUBSTANTIVE` re-checks 5.6-1 `[v2]`.
- **Business Rules:** Re-validate FR-TRJ-002 at approval; deputation/repatriation orders create `deputation_records` (FR-TRJ-011). Numbering is never "retry-on-collision" — it is reserve-then-commit (Risk 13) `[v2]`.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `transfer_requests`, `order_number_sequences` `[v2]`, `documents`, `sr_outbox` `[v2]`, `workflow_instances`, `clearance_checklists`, `deputation_records`, `vacancy_reservations`.

  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Order composer with template preview + `order_class` selector + distance band; approval timeline; publish confirmation showing downstream effects (service, clearance, SR); PDF viewer.
- **Edge Cases:** Sequence row contention (row-lock, no gap); PDF render failure (order stays `APPROVED`, publish blocked, reserved number voided + audited); ban window now active; reservation expired meanwhile.

### FR-TRJ-005 — Bulk Transfer Drive Management
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Bulk Drives
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As HR Admin, I want to run an annual/seasonal transfer drive that batch-processes hundreds of transfers so that large cadre movements are efficient and consistent.*
- **Description:** Manages a `transfer_drive` lifecycle: scope/cadre, publish vacancies, open preference window (FR-TRJ-003) **or run a counselling session (FR-TRJ-019)** `[v2]`, allot, and **batch-generate orders** (FR-TRJ-004) with progress tracking, partial-failure isolation, and a dashboard. CSV import + bulk eligibility pre-screen. Vacancy reservations carry the lifecycle that prevents **cascading double-fill** at join time `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Drive progresses `DRAFT`→`OPEN`→`COUNSELLING`→`ALLOTTED`→`ORDERS_ISSUED`→`CLOSED`.
  2. Bulk eligibility pre-screen flags blocked candidates before allotment.
  3. Batch order generation is resumable; a failed candidate quarantines, not aborts.
  4. Dashboard shows counts by stage and pendency.
  5. Closing requires all allotted candidates to have orders issued or be explicitly excluded.
  6. Reservation-to-order transition re-checks `vacant_count > 0` transactionally `[v2]`.
- **Business Rules:** Per-candidate eligibility (FR-002) and substantive-uniqueness (5.6-1); ban-window applies drive-wide unless exempted.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_drives`, `transfer_preferences`, `vacancy_positions`, `vacancy_reservations` `[v2]`, `transfer_requests`, `transfer_orders`.

### FR-TRJ-006 — Relieving: No-Dues / Clearance Checklist (with SLA escalation & deemed clearance)
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Relieving — Clearance
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source), Clearance Officers, Estate Officer, Employee
- **User Story:** *As a source HR officer, I want a departmental no-dues checklist auto-created on order publication, with SLAs and an escalation path, so that one non-responsive officer cannot block relieving indefinitely.*
- **Description:** On publication a `clearance_checklist` with `clearance_items` for each **configured** department of the source office is generated (offices with fewer departments generate fewer items) `[v2]`. Each item carries an `sla_due_at`; on breach it escalates `OFFICER → DEPT_HEAD → AUTHORITY` `[v2]`. The Authority may grant `DEEMED_CLEARED` with reason (FR-TRJ-016). Checklist reaches `CLEARED`, `CLEARED_WITH_DUES`, or `CLEARED_WITH_DEEMED` `[v2]`. Gates relieving (FR-TRJ-008).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Checklist auto-created with one item per **configured** department.
  2. Only the assigned Clearance Officer (or HR override with reason) updates an item.
  3. Outstanding dues require `dues_amount`/description; checklist cannot reach `CLEARED` with open dues unless `CLEARED_WITH_DUES` (`dues_recovery_ref`).
  4. Each item has an SLA; breaches escalate through tiers with notifications `[v2]`.
  5. Authority `DEEMED_CLEARED` requires `forced_action_reason` + `forced_action_by`; counts toward `deemed_items` `[v2]`.
  6. Every change writes `audit_log`.
- **Business Rules:** Clearance Officer ≠ transferee; dues link to M10 recovery; `WAIVED`/`DEEMED_CLEARED` require Authority approval (audited).
- **Data Model References:** `clearance_checklists`, `clearance_items`, `transfer_orders`, `documents`, `notifications`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/clearance` |

### FR-TRJ-007 — Charge Handover at Source (with handover-under-protest)
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Relieving — Charge Handover
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (relinquishing), Charge Receiving Officer, HR Officer (Source), Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a relieving employee, I want to formally hand over charge — and where a dispute would trap me, hand over under protest within a time-bound resolution — so accountability transfers without indefinite blocking.*
- **Description:** Records a `charge_handover` (phase `HANDOVER_SOURCE`) of assets, pending files, cash/imprest, and a note (M13). Receiving officer/successor (or **link officer / custody-of-office where no successor exists** `[v2]`) accepts or disputes. A dispute starts a **time-bound resolution clock (`dispute_sla_due_at`)**; on breach, the Authority may certify **handover-under-protest** (FR-TRJ-016), unblocking relieving while preserving the dispute for separate resolution `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Handover captures asset inventory, cash/imprest, pending files, note document.
  2. Receiving officer can `ACCEPT` or `DISPUTE` with remarks.
  3. A dispute does **not** block relieving indefinitely: after `dispute_sla_due_at`, Authority `HANDOVER_UNDER_PROTEST` is available with reason `[v2]`.
  4. Charge type (`FULL`/`ADDITIONAL`/`CURRENT_DUTIES`) recorded; `ADDITIONAL_CHARGE` orders never block a substantive relieving `[v2]`.
- **Business Rules:** Relinquisher ≠ acceptor; cash/imprest mismatch flags an accounts clearance dependency (FR-006); under-protest preserves the dispute record and notifies Accounts/Authority.
- **Data Model References:** `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `employees`, `documents`.

### FR-TRJ-008 — Relieving Order, Last Working Day & Pay-Continuity Signal
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Relieving — Order & LWD
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source), Transfer Authority, Payroll Officer
- **User Story:** *As source HR, I want to issue a relieving order setting the last working day once clearance and handover are complete (or deemed) so that the employee is formally relieved and pay is continued — not stopped — across the handoff.*
- **Description:** Issues a `relieving_order` once clearance (FR-006) and handover (FR-007) preconditions are met **or a `deemed_relief` Authority action is recorded** (FR-016) `[v2]`. Sets `last_working_day`, relieving time (FN/AN — load-bearing, §16.9), generates the relieving order PDF (M13), enqueues a **`PAY_CONTINUITY` + `LPC_REQUEST` signal to M10 via `sr_outbox`** (not a pay-stop) `[v2]`, sets `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id` and transitions the order `RELIEVED`→`IN_TRANSIT` (via `TransferOrderStateService`), marks the `vacancy_reservation` `VACATED_ON_RELIEF` `[v2]`, enforces **mutual paired-progress** `[v2]`, and enqueues the **relieving SR event asserting no break in service** (FR-012/015).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Relieving order issued only when clearance ∈ {CLEARED, CLEARED_WITH_DUES, CLEARED_WITH_DEEMED} and (if required) handover ACCEPTED/UNDER_PROTEST — **or** `deemed_relief` recorded `[v2]`.
  2. `last_working_day ≥ served_on_date` and ≤ `relieve_by_date` (late relief flagged, not hard-blocked); enforcement uses **served date** `[v2]`.
  3. On issue: PDF stored, **pay-continuity + LPC** enqueued to M10, SR RELIEVED event enqueued (`service_continuity_asserted=true`), order → `IN_TRANSIT`, custody set, reservation vacated `[v2]`.
  4. Unique gapless `relieving_order_no` generated.
  5. For `MUTUAL`, the counterpart's progress is checked; asymmetric completion blocked (5.6-5) `[v2]`.
- **Business Rules:** Pay is continued (continuity signal), LPC requested exactly once; relieving beyond `relieve_by_date` requires remark; deemed-relief requires Authority + reason.
- **Data Model References:** `relieving_orders`, `clearance_checklists`, `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `vacancy_reservations`, `documents`, `sr_outbox`.

### FR-TRJ-009 — Transfer-in-Transit & Joining-Time Management (contracted calendar)
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Transit Management
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source/Destination), Employee, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want the period between relieving and joining tracked with admissible joining time computed against a proper regional working-day calendar so transit is visible, paid, controlled, and not abused.*
- **Description:** Maintains `IN_TRANSIT` between LWD and joining. Computes admissible **joining time by distance band** (§16.4) using the **contracted Platform Calendar Service (regional-calendar aware)** — the v1 silent "Sat/Sun + national holidays" fallback is removed; an unavailable calendar raises `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` and the computation is deferred, not silently wrong `[v2]`. Monitors elapsed transit, flags overdue, exposes an in-transit register, and shows the **in-transit custodian** for each employee `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Orders display `IN_TRANSIT` with day counter, admissible-by date, and **custodian office** `[v2]`.
  2. Joining-time computation uses the contracted calendar service and `joining_distance_band`; no silent default `[v2]`.
  3. Transit exceeding admissible time raises overdue flag + notification to both offices.
  4. In-transit register lists employees with source/destination, custodian, and elapsed days.
- **Business Rules:** Transit is bounded by policy and **paid** (FR-015); extension of joining time requires Authority approval (recorded); unjoined beyond grace triggers `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW` (FR-018).
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders` (transit/custody), `relieving_orders`, `joining_reports`, Platform Calendar Service (contracted).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/in-transit?org_unit=&cursor=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/extend-joining-time` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** In-transit register with elapsed/limit bars; custodian column; overdue rows highlighted; extension modal (Authority); calendar-unavailable banner if computation deferred.
- **Edge Cases:** Cross-region calendar differences (resolved by contracted service); employee joins early; never joins (→ FR-018); **calendar service down (deferred compute, explicit error, not silent default)** `[v2]`.

### FR-TRJ-010 — Joining Report & Charge Assumption at Destination
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Joining
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Transferee), HR Officer (Destination), Charge Receiving Officer, Payroll Officer
- **User Story:** *As a transferred employee, I want to submit a joining report and assume charge so my joining date is confirmed, pay continuity resumes at destination, and my posting is updated.*
- **Description:** Transferee submits a `joining_report`; destination HR verifies, records charge assumption (`ASSUMPTION_DEST`), confirms the statutory `joining_date`, computes transit vs admissible, **assigns the inter-se joining sequence (FR-021)** `[v2]`, **re-checks the vacancy reservation transactionally and marks it `FILLED_ON_JOIN`** `[v2]`, enqueues a **`PAY_CONTINUITY` resume + `POSTING_UPDATE` to M01 via `sr_outbox`** `[v2]`, clears `in_transit_custody` (M01 becomes authoritative), enforces **mutual paired-progress** `[v2]`, and enqueues the **joining SR event asserting no break in service** (FR-012/015). Late joining routes to FR-018.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Joining report submitted only against an `IN_TRANSIT` order (exception: `JOINING_WITHOUT_RELIEF` flagged).
  2. Destination HR verification confirms `joining_date`; transit + admissibility computed.
  3. On confirmation: charge assumption recorded, **reservation re-check + FILLED_ON_JOIN**, pay-continuity resumed, M01 posting updated, **joining sequence assigned**, SR JOINED enqueued (continuity asserted), order → `JOINED` `[v2]`.
  4. Late joining (beyond admissible + grace) routes to `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW` (FR-018) before confirmation.
  5. Unique gapless `joining_report_no` generated; **mutual counterpart coupling enforced** `[v2]`.
- **Business Rules:** `joining_date ≥ LWD`; M01 update is the single authoritative posting change; deputation joining updates `deputation_records` start (FR-011); reservation double-fill blocked (`TRJ_VACANCY_FULL`).
- **Data Model References:** `joining_reports`, `charge_handovers`, `transfer_orders`, `vacancy_reservations`, `employees`(M01), `sr_outbox`, `deputation_records`.

  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/verify` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/confirm` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Joining wizard (report → charge assumption → confirm); HR verification with transit summary + **joining-sequence assignment**; late-joining banner with review action.
- **Edge Cases:** Reported but charge not available; joining before relieving processed; date disputes; promotion-linked designation change; **reservation filled by another joiner (concurrency)** `[v2]`; mutual counterpart not yet relieved.

### FR-TRJ-011 — Deputation Terms & Repatriation Management
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Deputation & Repatriation
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority, Employee
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want to manage deputation tenure, terms, extensions and repatriation so lent employees return on time and terms are tracked.*
- **Description:** For `DEPUTATION` orders (`order_class=DEPUTATION`), maintains a `deputation_record` (borrowing/lending units, terms, tenure, extensions with caps, repatriation due/status). Generates repatriation alerts and processes repatriation as a reverse transfer with `order_class=REPATRIATION` (reusing FR-004/006/008/010) — which **legitimately co-exists** with the original deputation during overlap (5.6-1 reframed) `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Deputation record auto-created when a deputation order is published.
  2. Extension requests validated against `max_tenure_months`; over-cap blocked (`TRJ_DEPUTATION_CAP_EXCEEDED`).
  3. Repatriation-due alerts raised ahead of `current_end_date`.
  4. Repatriation initiates a reverse `REPATRIATION`-class order to the lending unit `[v2]`.
- **Business Rules:** Terms in `deputation_terms`; external borrowing units are `org_units` type `EXTERNAL`; max tenure enforced by policy (FR-002).
- **Data Model References:** `deputation_records`, `transfer_orders` (order_class), `org_units`, `employees`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/deputations?status=&cursor=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/deputations/{id}/extend` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/deputations/{id}/repatriate` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Deputation register with tenure timeline; extension modal with cap validation; repatriation action launching reverse-transfer wizard.
- **Edge Cases:** Extension beyond cap; early recall; deputee resigns on deputation; external unit not in org tree.

### FR-TRJ-012 — Service Register (SR) Event Posting via Transactional Outbox
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · SR Posting
- **Primary Role(s):** System, SR Custodian/Registrar
- **User Story:** *As the SR custodian, I want every transfer, relieving and joining event reliably posted to the Digital SR so the statutory service record is complete, accurate, and asserts continuous service.*
- **Description:** Posts append-only `service_register_events` to M12 at three checkpoints (TRANSFER_ORDERED, RELIEVED, JOINED) using the **fully field-specified `sr_outbox`** (§5.2.15) `[v2]`. Idempotency keys follow the documented formula; retry uses exponential backoff with `max_attempts`; exhausted rows are `DEAD_LETTERED` and surfaced for the Custodian. The same outbox carries M10 (`PAY_CONTINUITY`,`ENTITLEMENT`,`LPC_REQUEST`,`LICENCE_FEE_RECOVERY`) and M01 (`POSTING_UPDATE`) signals `[v2]`. RELIEVED/JOINED payloads carry `service_continuity_asserted` `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Exactly one SR event per checkpoint per order (idempotent via key formula).
  2. Failed postings retried; exhausted → `DEAD_LETTERED` + surfaced to Custodian.
  3. SR payload includes order_no, source/destination, dates, event type, **continuity assertion**, references.
  4. A reconciliation report lists orders with missing/failed SR events and outbox dead-letters.
- **Business Rules:** SR events immutable; corrections are new `COMPENSATING` events; outbox writes share the local DB transaction; failures never block local state.
- **Data Model References:** `sr_outbox` `[v2]`, `service_register_events`(M12), `transfer_orders`, `relieving_orders`, `joining_reports`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** SR reconciliation console listing `PENDING`/`FAILED`/`DEAD_LETTERED` outbox rows with retry; per-order SR timeline.
- **Edge Cases:** M12 down at checkpoint; duplicate retry (idempotency key dedupes); partial payload; clock skew; dead-letter after `max_attempts`.

### FR-TRJ-013 — Order Amendment, Cancellation & Post-Relief Revocation
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Amendment / Cancellation
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin, Transfer Authority
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want to amend, cancel or revoke a transfer order at the correct lifecycle stage so corrections and recalls are handled with full audit and statutory compensation.*
- **Description:** Three stage-aware corrective actions: **amend** (pre-relief — supersede with `revision_no`++, new gapless PDF, compensating SR), **cancel** (pre-relief — close order, reverse clearance/handover/reservation, notify), **revoke** (post-relief/join — recall requiring compensating SR, M01 posting reversal, **pay-continuity reversal/reconciliation** to M10) `[v2]`. All require Authority approval + justification; all `status` writes via `TransferOrderStateService` `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Amendment only pre-relief; new revision via `superseded_by_order_id`; reserved number committed/voided gaplessly `[v2]`.
  2. Cancellation pre-relief; reverses clearance/handover and **releases vacancy reservation** `[v2]`; notifies stakeholders.
  3. Revocation (post-relief/join) enqueues compensating SR + **pay-continuity reconciliation** signal to M10 and M01 reversal `[v2]`.
  4. Every action requires justification + Authority approval; written to `audit_log`.
- **Business Rules:** SR-posted records never hard-deleted (5.6-10); revocation after joining reverses M01 posting via M01 API with reason; active `STAY_HOLD` must be vacated or the action recorded as hold-driven `[v2]`.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders`, `clearance_checklists`, `charge_handovers`, `joining_reports`, `vacancy_reservations`, `sr_outbox`, `employees`(M01).
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |

  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/amend` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/cancel` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/revoke` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Stage-aware action menu (only valid actions enabled); justification-required modal; impact preview listing reversals (clearance, reservation, SR, M01, pay).
- **Edge Cases:** Amend after clearance started; cancel after partial clearance; revoke after pay paid (reconciliation); concurrent amend + relieving; active hold.

### FR-TRJ-014 — Geographic Mapping & Transfer Analytics Dashboard (Phase-2 map)
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Mapping & Analytics
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin, Transfer Authority, Auditor, Reporting Manager
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want analytics on transfers, pendency, clearance, transit, custody and SR health so I can monitor mobility health and act on bottlenecks.*
- **Description:** Dashboard with analytics: transfers by type/class/stage, relieving pendency, clearance bottlenecks (incl. SLA breaches/deemed-clearances), in-transit/overdue counts **with custody integrity checks**, SR/outbox health, drive progress, deputation tenure, **representation/stay-hold load, abandonment counts, quarter overstays** `[v2]`. The **geographic map is re-prioritised to Phase-2** (Risk 18); analytics ship in baseline `[v2]`. Feeds M14.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. KPI cards show counts for each lifecycle stage, overdue/pending, **custody-integrity exceptions, un-overridden violations, dead-letters** `[v2]`.
  2. Clearance bottleneck view ranks departments by average clearance time and SLA-breach rate.
  3. All figures respect row-level org scope; Auditor sees all read-only.
  4. Data exportable (CSV/PDF) with pagination.
  5. **Map view delivered as a Phase-2 enhancement** behind a feature flag `[v2]`.
- **Business Rules:** Aggregations read-only; no PII beyond role scope; numbers reconcile with operational records.
- **Data Model References:** all M05 entities (read), incl. `transfer_representations`, `quarter_allotments`, `sr_outbox`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/analytics/summary` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/analytics/clearance-bottlenecks` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/map/vacancies?cadre=&office=` *(Phase-2)* |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** KPI grid + trend charts + bottleneck table (baseline); map panel (Phase-2 flag); drill-down to filtered lists; export.
- **Edge Cases:** Missing geo-coordinates (list-only); large result sets (server aggregation + pagination); timezone in trend buckets.

### FR-TRJ-015 — Service Continuity, Joining-Time Pay & In-Transit Custody `[v2 — new; Critical]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Service Continuity & Custody
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Source/Destination), Transfer Authority, Payroll Officer, SR Custodian
- **User Story:** *As the organisation, I want the transit/joining-time period treated as continuous paid service owned by a defined custodian office, so employees are never underpaid and headcount is never dual- or zero-counted.*
- **Description:** Replaces the v1 pay-stop/pay-start model. On relieving, M10 receives a single **`PAY_CONTINUITY`** signal (continue pay across the handoff) plus an **`ENTITLEMENT`** signal keyed on `transfer_type`+`ground` (own-request vs administrative differ in TTA, transfer grant, joining-time-pay admissibility) `[v2]`. The transit period is **paid duty/leave** (`joining_time_pay_admissible`). An explicit **in-transit custodian** (`in_transit_custody_org_unit_id`) owns pay/attendance/leave/headcount/discipline during `IN_TRANSIT`, with an integrity rule preventing dual/zero posting (5.6-12). SR RELIEVED/JOINED events assert **no break in qualifying service** (5.6-11).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Relieving enqueues a `PAY_CONTINUITY` (not pay-stop) signal and an `ENTITLEMENT` signal keyed on `transfer_type`+`ground`.
  2. `joining_time_pay_admissible` is computed by policy (`JOINING_TIME_PAY` rule) and stored on the order.
  3. While `IN_TRANSIT`, exactly one custodian office is set; dual/null custody is blocked (`TRJ_DUAL_POSTING_BLOCKED`).
  4. SR RELIEVED and JOINED events carry `service_continuity_asserted=true` unless an explicit break (abandonment) is recorded.
  5. Headcount/budget reports count the in-transit employee exactly once (against custodian).
- **Business Rules:** Custodian defaults to destination for substantive transfers (configurable per policy); own-request transfers may have reduced joining-time-pay per rule; abandonment (FR-018) breaks continuity explicitly.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_orders` (`in_transit_custody_org_unit_id`,`joining_time_pay_admissible`,`entitlement_ref`), `relieving_orders` (`pay_continuity_signalled`), `joining_reports` (`service_continuity_asserted`,`pay_continuity_resumed`), `sr_outbox`, `transfer_policy_rules`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/custody` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/custody` (set/override custodian) |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/entitlement` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Order detail shows custodian office, continuity status, entitlement reference; relieving/joining confirmation explicitly states "pay continued" (never "pay stopped"); headcount reports flag custody.
- **Edge Cases:** Custodian office dissolved mid-transit (re-assign + audit); own-request with no joining-time pay; abandonment breaking continuity; entitlement service (M10) unavailable (outbox retry).
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `ServiceContinuityService`, `CustodyAssigner`, `EntitlementSignalClient(M10)`, `SrOutboxWriter` |
  | Backend Flow | On relieve: compute `joining_time_pay_admissible`, set custodian, enqueue `PAY_CONTINUITY`+`ENTITLEMENT`; on join: resume continuity, clear custody (M01 authoritative) |
  | Data Operations | UPDATE `transfer_orders`,`relieving_orders`,`joining_reports`; INSERT `sr_outbox`,`audit_log` |
  | Validation | Single-custodian invariant (5.6-12); continuity assertion (5.6-11); entitlement keying |
  | Authorization | HR set; Authority override custodian |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Continuity + custody fields; M10 entitlement/continuity; SR continuity assertion |
  | Failure Handling | M10 via outbox retry; dual/null custody → `TRJ_DUAL_POSTING_BLOCKED` |
  | Dependencies | FR-008/010/012/018, M10, M12 |

### FR-TRJ-016 — Authority Forced-Action Powers (deemed-clearance, handover-under-protest, deemed-relief) `[v2 — new]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Authority Forced-Action
- **Primary Role(s):** Transfer Authority, HR Officer (initiator), Auditor
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority, I want a single, audited forced-action power to break human-conflict deadlocks — non-responsive clearance, hostile handover, source refusing to relieve — so an employee is never trapped indefinitely.*
- **Description:** One mechanism (`forced_action_type`) covering: `DEEMED_CLEARED` (after SLA + escalation `OFFICER→DEPT_HEAD→AUTHORITY`, FR-006), `HANDOVER_UNDER_PROTEST` (after dispute SLA, FR-007), and `DEEMED_RELIEF`/`stand_relieved` (FR-008). Each requires a Transfer Authority, a mandatory `forced_action_reason`, and writes a dedicated audit row with actor; the transferee may never be the granting Authority `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Each forced action is gated to Transfer Authority + mandatory reason + recorded approver.
  2. `DEEMED_CLEARED` only after the item's SLA breach and escalation chain exhausted (or Authority-justified emergency).
  3. `HANDOVER_UNDER_PROTEST` only after `dispute_sla_due_at`; preserves the underlying dispute.
  4. `DEEMED_RELIEF` issues/marks a relieving order with `deemed_relief=true`, satisfying the relieving precondition (5.6-2).
  5. Every forced action is independently queryable for audit/analytics.
- **Business Rules:** Forced actions do not erase dues/disputes — they unblock the lifecycle while the financial/charge dispute proceeds separately (and may signal M10 recovery). Transferee-exclusion enforced.
- **Data Model References:** `clearance_items`, `charge_handovers`, `relieving_orders` (forced-action fields), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | POST | `/api/v1/clearance/items/{id}/deem-cleared` |

  | POST | `/api/v1/relieving-orders/{id}/deemed-relieve` |
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/forced-actions?type=&cursor=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Authority-only forced-action drawer with mandatory reason (≥ 20 chars), escalation/dispute context shown, confirmation listing downstream effects; forced-action audit log view.
- **Edge Cases:** Forced action attempted before SLA/escalation exhausted (blocked unless emergency-justified); transferee attempts self-forced-action (FORBIDDEN); concurrent forced action + officer clearance.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `ForcedActionService`, `DeemedClearanceController`, `UnderProtestController`, `DeemedRelieveController` |

### FR-TRJ-017 — Representation, Stay-Order & Retention Hold `[v2 — new]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Representation & Holds
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee, HR Officer, Transfer Authority, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As the organisation, I want representations, court/tribunal stays, and retention requests to pause a transfer order at any pre-join stage with full audit, so contested transfers are handled lawfully instead of forcing an irreversible move.*
- **Description:** New `transfer_representations` entity and `STAY_HOLD` order status. A representation/stay/retention request can be filed against an order and, when upheld or a court stay is in force, set the order `STAY_HOLD` (`hold_active=true`), blocking all forward transitions (5.6-16) until vacated. Decisions (`ALLOW`/`DENY`/`MODIFY`/`VACATE`) are recorded with authority and validity `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A representation/stay/retention can be filed against any order pre-join, referencing a document and authority/case number.
  2. An upheld representation or active court stay transitions the order to `STAY_HOLD` and sets `hold_active=true`.
  3. While `hold_active`, no forward transition (relieve/join) is permitted (`TRJ_STAY_HOLD_ACTIVE`).
  4. Vacating the hold (`VACATE`/expiry) restores the prior status via `TransferOrderStateService` with audit.
  5. All filings/decisions are audited and visible to Auditor.
- **Business Rules:** Court stays (`COURT_STAY`) may only be vacated on recorded court order/expiry; retention requests follow Authority decision; holds do not delete the order.
- **Data Model References:** `transfer_representations` `[v2]`, `transfer_orders` (`status`,`hold_active`), `documents`, `audit_log`.

  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/holds?status=&cursor=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Representation filing form (type, authority ref, document); hold banner on order detail; Authority decision modal; holds register.
- **Edge Cases:** Stay filed mid-relieving (hold blocks further steps, already-issued relieving preserved); overlapping representations; stay expiry auto-vacate; retention request denied.

### FR-TRJ-018 — Non-Joining / Abandonment Resolution `[v2 — new]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Non-Joining / Abandonment
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Destination), Transfer Authority, Disciplinary Authority (M09)
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want a defined path for an employee who never joins beyond grace, so they do not sit in permanent IN_TRANSIT limbo with undefined pay and posting.*
- **Description:** When transit exceeds admissible + grace, the joining report enters `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW`. The Authority decides between **`REVERT_TO_SOURCE`** (re-join at source as a reverse joining, restoring source posting + custody) and **`ABANDONED`** (continuity break recorded, M09 disciplinary trigger raised) `[v2]`. The limbo-period pay status is explicitly defined (continuity until grace; thereafter per Authority decision — paid pending inquiry or stopped on abandonment) `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Transit beyond admissible + grace routes the joining report to `LATE_JOINING_REVIEW`.
  2. Authority decides `REVERT_TO_SOURCE` or `ABANDONED` with mandatory reason.
  3. `REVERT_TO_SOURCE` restores source posting/custody and records a reverse joining (order → `REVERTED_TO_SOURCE`).
  4. `ABANDONED` records a continuity break (`service_continuity_asserted=false`), raises an M09 disciplinary trigger, and sets pay status per decision (order → `ABANDONED`).
  5. The limbo-period pay treatment is recorded and signalled to M10.
- **Business Rules:** Abandonment is the only path that breaks service continuity (5.6-11 exception); revert-to-source re-uses joining mechanics in reverse; M09 trigger is a signal, not a proceeding (owned by M09).
- **Data Model References:** `joining_reports` (`status`), `transfer_orders` (`status`,custody), `sr_outbox` (M09/M10 signals), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/late-joining?cursor=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/revert-to-source` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/abandon` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Late-joining review queue; Authority decision modal (revert vs abandon) with reason and pay-status selector; outcome banner.
- **Edge Cases:** Employee joins during review (cancel review); revert when source post already filled (additional/supernumerary handling); abandonment then later representation.

### FR-TRJ-019 — Interactive Counselling Session `[v2 — new]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Interactive Counselling
- **Primary Role(s):** Transfer Authority / Presiding Officer, HR Admin, Employee
- **User Story:** *As a Transfer Authority running a cadre counselling, I want candidates called in seniority/merit order to choose live from remaining vacancies with an immutable choice log, so allotment is observed, contestable, and defensible in a tribunal.*
- **Description:** For `drive_type=COUNSELLING`, a `counselling_session` is created with a per-candidate turn order (`SENIORITY`/`MERIT`). When a candidate's turn is live, the system **locks the candidate's available vacancies** (one live turn at a time), the candidate chooses (or passes/declines), and an **immutable `counselling_choices` row** is recorded by the presiding officer. The chosen vacancy converts to a `vacancy_reservation` and feeds order generation (FR-004). The batch path (FR-003) remains for `SENIORITY`/`MERIT`/`MANUAL` drives — the two coexist, selected by `drive_type` `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Candidates are ordered by `turn_order_method`; only the current-turn candidate may choose.
  2. During a live turn the chosen-from vacancy set is locked; no concurrent allotment of the same vacancy.
  3. Each choice (`CHOSEN`/`PASSED`/`DECLINED`/`AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT`/`ABSENT`) is recorded immutably with timestamp and recording officer.
  4. A turn times out after `turn_timeout_seconds` → `AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT`.
  5. A `CHOSEN` vacancy becomes a `RESERVED` `vacancy_reservation`; the choice log is append-only and exportable.
- **Business Rules:** Candidates must pass FR-002; choice log is never edited/deleted (5.6-10); presiding officer records on behalf (observed); seniority ties broken deterministically by `service_no`.
- **Data Model References:** `counselling_sessions` `[v2]`, `counselling_choices` `[v2]`, `vacancy_positions`, `vacancy_reservations`, `transfer_drives`, `employees`.
- **API References:**

  | GET | `/api/v1/counselling-sessions/{id}/choices` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Presiding console showing turn queue, live candidate, remaining vacancies (locked during turn), record-choice action, countdown timer; public choice-log view for transparency.
- **Edge Cases:** Candidate absent (`ABSENT`, turn advances); two officers recording simultaneously (single live turn lock); vacancy exhausted before a turn; session paused/resumed.
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `CounsellingSessionService`, `TurnOrchestrator`, `VacancyLockManager` `[v2]`, `ChoiceLogWriter` (append-only), `PresidingConsole` |

  | Data Operations | INSERT `counselling_sessions`; append `counselling_choices`; `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` vacancy lock; INSERT `vacancy_reservations`; `audit_log` |
  | Validation | Single live turn; current-turn-only choice; timeout; tie-break |

### FR-TRJ-020 — Order Proof-of-Service & Acknowledgement `[v2 — new]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Proof-of-Service
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Employee, Transfer Authority, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want recorded proof that the transfer order was served on the employee and (where possible) acknowledged, so relieve-by deadlines and non-compliance discipline rest on the served date, not the order date.*
- **Description:** On publication, the order is served through a `delivery_channel` (in-app/email/SMS/registered-post/hand-delivery/published-notice) and an `order_acknowledgements` row records `served_on_date`. The employee may acknowledge (`ACKNOWLEDGED`); non-acknowledgement after policy time, or returned registered post / published notice, yields `DEEMED_SERVED`; refusal yields `REFUSED`. `transfer_orders.served_on_date`/`acknowledged_at` mirror the canonical record, and **`relieve_by_date` enforcement references the served date** (5.6-15) `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Publication creates an acknowledgement row with channel and `served_on_date`.
  2. Employee acknowledgement sets `ACKNOWLEDGED` + `acknowledged_at`.
  3. Non-ack within policy window / returned post / published notice → `DEEMED_SERVED` with reason; refusal → `REFUSED`.
  4. An order cannot enter `RELIEVING_IN_PROGRESS` without a `SERVED`/`DEEMED_SERVED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED` row (5.6-15).
  5. `relieve_by_date` is computed from `served_on_date`, not `order_date`.
- **Business Rules:** Registered-post/hand-delivery require a `proof_document_id`; deemed-served requires recorded reason; served date is the statutory basis for non-compliance.
- **Data Model References:** `order_acknowledgements` `[v2]`, `transfer_orders` (`served_on_date`,`acknowledged_at`,`relieve_by_date`), `documents`, `notifications`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |

  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/orders/{id}/service-record` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Service panel (channel selector, proof upload, served date); employee acknowledgement prompt on My Transfers; deemed-served action with reason; service-record timeline.
- **Edge Cases:** Employee on leave/unreachable (registered post → deemed); refusal to acknowledge; multiple delivery attempts; served before publish (blocked).
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `OrderServiceController`, `AcknowledgementService`, `DeemedServedController`, `ServicePanel` |

### FR-TRJ-021 — Joining-Sequence & Inter-se Seniority Integrity `[v2 — new]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Joining-Sequence & Seniority
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (Destination), System, Transfer Authority, Auditor
- **User Story:** *As HR, I want a defensible inter-se joining order when several transferees join the same cadre/post, because joining-date order sets seniority that M06 consumes and that transfer litigation hinges on.*
- **Description:** On joining confirmation, assigns `joining_sequence_no` ordered by `reported_date` then `joining_time` (FN before AN) then a deterministic `inter_se_tiebreak_key` (default `service_no`) for joiners sharing (`dest_org_unit_id`,`dest_designation_id`,`joining_date`). The tuple is unique (5.6-14) and exposed to M06 so seniority computation is reproducible and contestable `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Concurrent same-cadre/post joinings on a date receive distinct, contiguous `joining_sequence_no`.
  2. Ordering is `reported_date` → `joining_time` (FN<AN) → `inter_se_tiebreak_key`.
  3. The sequence tuple is unique per (`dest_org_unit_id`,`dest_designation_id`,`joining_date`).
  4. The sequence + tie-break key are exposed to M06.
  5. Authority may adjust sequence only with recorded justification (audited).
- **Business Rules:** Tie-break is deterministic (`service_no` default; policy-configurable); manual re-sequencing is Authority-only and audited; the sequence feeds M06 but seniority math is owned by M06.
- **Data Model References:** `joining_reports` (`joining_sequence_no`,`inter_se_tiebreak_key`), M06 (consumer), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/api/v1/transfers/joining-sequence?office=&designation=&date=` |
  | POST | `/api/v1/joining-reports/{id}/resequence` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Destination HR joining-sequence grid for the date showing computed order; Authority re-sequence action with justification; M06 export indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Same reported_date + same FN/AN + tie-break collision (impossible by `service_no` uniqueness); back-dated joining; re-sequencing after M06 consumption (compensating notice).
- **Low-Level Design:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `JoiningSequencer`, `SeniorityFeedClient(M06)`, `SequenceGrid` |
  | Backend Flow | On confirm: compute sequence within (office,designation,date) with deterministic ordering → persist → feed M06 |

### FR-TRJ-022 — Enterprise Quarters / Estate Retention & Licence-Fee Recovery `[v2 — new]`
- **Module:** M05-TRJ · Quarters / Estate
- **Primary Role(s):** Estate / Quarters Officer, HR Officer, Transfer Authority, Payroll Officer, Employee
- **User Story:** *As an estate officer, I want official-accommodation retention, vacation timelines, and licence-fee recovery modelled as a sub-process — not one checklist tick — so post-transfer accommodation is tracked and recovered statutorily.*
- **Description:** Models a `quarter_allotment` for transferees occupying official accommodation: retention-allowed flag (Authority-approved), `vacate_by_date`, vacation tracking, normal/penal `licence_fee_rate`, and a **licence-fee-recovery signal to M10** when accommodation is retained beyond entitlement `[v2]`. Linked to the `ESTATE_QUARTERS` clearance item (FR-006) but richer: clearance can be `CLEARED_WITH_DUES` with an active retention rather than blocking relieving `[v2]`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A quarter retention record can be created/approved with `vacate_by_date` and licence-fee rate.
  2. Retention beyond permissible period flips `penal_rate_applies=true` and status `OVERSTAY`.
  3. An overstay/retention raises a **licence-fee-recovery signal to M10** with reference.
  4. Vacation recording sets `VACATED` + `vacated_on`; closes the estate clearance dependency.
  5. The estate clearance item does not hard-block relieving when retention is approved (recovery tracked separately).
- **Business Rules:** Retention requires Authority approval; penal rate per policy after permissible months; licence-fee recovery is an M10 signal (recovery owned by M10); vacation reconciles the estate clearance item.
- **Data Model References:** `quarter_allotments` `[v2]`, `clearance_items` (ESTATE_QUARTERS), `sr_outbox` (M10 licence-fee signal), `transfer_orders`.
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path |

  | GET | `/api/v1/quarter-allotments?status=&cursor=` |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Estate panel with retention request/approval, vacate-by countdown, penal-rate indicator, vacation recording; licence-fee recovery status; estate register.
- **Edge Cases:** Retention denied (must vacate by relieving); overstay beyond all limits (escalation); vacation before relieving; external/leased accommodation.

## 8. API & Integration

### 8.1 Conventions
REST under `/api/v1`; JWT bearer; RBAC + row-level scope; cursor/page pagination (max 100); idempotency keys on POST that trigger external signals (formula §5.2.15); ISO-8601 UTC; `DD-MMM-YYYY` display client-side. All `transfer_orders.status` mutations route through `TransferOrderStateService` (§16.6).

### 8.2 Error envelope & module error-code catalog
Canonical envelope: `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field" }, "requestId" }`.

| Code | HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| VALIDATION_ERROR | 400 | Field/payload invalid |
| AUTH_REQUIRED | 401 | Missing/expired token |

| TRJ_SR_POST_FAILED | 503 | SR posting failed (retryable, outbox) |
| TRJ_VACANCY_FULL | 409 | Allotment/join to filled vacancy (incl. join-time re-check) `[v2]` |
| TRJ_DUAL_POSTING_BLOCKED | 409 | `[v2]` Dual/zero in-transit custody |
| TRJ_STAY_HOLD_ACTIVE | 409 | `[v2]` Forward transition blocked by active hold |
| TRJ_MUTUAL_PAIR_BLOCKED | 409 | `[v2]` Asymmetric mutual completion |
| TRJ_ORDER_NOT_SERVED | 409 | `[v2]` Relieving before proof-of-service |
| TRJ_NUMBER_SEQUENCE_LOCKED | 409 | `[v2]` Gapless number reservation contention (retry) |
| TRJ_COUNSELLING_TURN_VIOLATION | 409 | `[v2]` Choice attempted out of turn |
| TRJ_FORCED_ACTION_PRECONDITION | 409 | `[v2]` Forced action before SLA/escalation exhausted |

| UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE | 503 | M01/M06/M09/M10/M12/M13/Calendar unavailable |
| INTERNAL_ERROR | 500 | Unexpected |

### 8.3 Integration points
| System | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| M01 Employee Master | Read/Write | Validate transferee; update posting on join; reverse on revoke/abandon |
| M06 Promotion/Seniority | Read/Trigger | Promotion-linked trigger; **sanctioned-strength & seniority read-through** `[v2]`; **joining-sequence consumer** `[v2]` |
| M09 Disciplinary | Signal | `[v2]` Abandonment disciplinary trigger |
| M10 Payroll | Signal | **Pay-continuity** (not stop/start), **entitlement by transfer_type+ground** `[v2]`, LPC, dues recovery, **licence-fee recovery** `[v2]` |
| M12 Digital SR | Write (via `sr_outbox`) | SR events (order/relieve/join) with **continuity assertion** `[v2]` |
| M13 Documents | Read/Write | Order/clearance/handover/joining PDFs; **sensitive access class** for medical/spouse/compassionate `[v2]` |
| **Platform Calendar Service** | Read (contracted) | `[v2]` Regional working-day/holiday calendar for joining-time (no silent fallback) |
| Workflow engine | Read/Write | Approval routing |
| Notifications | Write | Lifecycle notifications |

**Calendar service contract `[v2]`:** `GET /calendar/working-days?from=&to=&region=` returns working-day count excluding regional holidays/weekends; unavailability returns `503` and joining-time computation is deferred (FR-009), never silently defaulted.

**M10 signal contract `[v2]`:** `PAY_CONTINUITY{employeeId, fromDate, custodyOrgUnit, continue:true}`, `ENTITLEMENT{employeeId, transferType, ground, distanceBand, joiningTimePayAdmissible}`, `LPC_REQUEST{...}`, `LICENCE_FEE_RECOVERY{employeeId, quarterRef, rate, penal}` — all idempotent via outbox key.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Performance | P95 API < 500ms; dashboard aggregates < 2s; bulk drive of 1,000 orders < 30 min (async); counselling turn record < 300ms. |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime; `sr_outbox` guarantees no data loss during M10/M12/M01 downtime. |
| Scalability | Horizontal scaling; batch/counselling jobs queue-based; supports 100k active employees, 20k transfers/year. |
| Security | OIDC/SSO + MFA; RBAC + row-level org scope; SoD invariants; OWASP ASVS; parameterised queries only; secrets via env. |
| Data integrity | All multi-step writes transactional; external signals via `sr_outbox` (idempotency-key formula); no orphan records; gapless statutory numbering; single-custodian invariant. |
| Auditability | Every state change in `audit_log` with before/after + actor + requestId; **forced actions, overrides, deemed-clearances, resequencing, and sensitive-document access carry dedicated reason+actor audit**; immutable SR events and counselling choice log. |
| Privacy/Compliance `[v2]` | DPDP Act 2023 alignment; **medical/spouse/compassionate evidence classified as DPDP sensitive category in M13 with restricted access and explicit access logging**; PII minimisation; statutory retention; no PII in logs. |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA across all screens. |
| Observability | Structured logs; metrics (clearance time, SLA breaches, deemed-clearances, transit days, custody exceptions, outbox dead-letter rate, un-overridden violations); traces with requestId. |
| Resilience | RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h; retries with backoff; dead-letter + reconciliation for outbox. |
| i18n/L10n | Bilingual order templates; regional working-day calendar (contracted); locale dates/currency; timezone-aware display. |

### 9.x Privacy — sensitive-ground documents `[v2]`
Documents supporting `MEDICAL`/`SPOUSE`/`COMPASSIONATE` grounds (`sensitive_document_ids`, `sensitive_ground=true`) are stored in M13 under a **sensitive access class**: access restricted to the transferee, the deciding Transfer Authority, and HR officers with an explicit need; every read is access-logged with actor + requestId; such documents are excluded from general analytics and never rendered in non-restricted UI contexts.

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data migration
- Import historical transfer/relieving/joining records into `transfer_orders`/`relieving_orders`/`joining_reports` with a `legacy_ref` tag; statuses normalised to terminal (`JOINED`/`CANCELLED`).
- Backfill in-flight transfers into the correct live state (relieved-but-not-joined → `IN_TRANSIT`) **and assign an in-transit custodian** `[v2]`.
- **Backfill `served_on_date` from legacy service registers; where unknown, mark `DEEMED_SERVED` with a migration reason** `[v2]`.
- Seed `transfer_policy_rules` (incl. `JOINING_TIME_PAY`), `transfer_ban_periods`, office clearance-department configs, **clearance SLAs, joining-time distance bands**, order templates, and **`order_number_sequences` initialised to the legacy high-water mark per office/year (no gaps)** `[v2]`.
- Reconcile legacy SR entries with M12 via `sr_outbox` compensating events; no duplicates (idempotency key).

### 13.2 Cutover & launch
- Dual-run period: legacy + HRMS for one transfer cycle; reconcile counts and **custody/continuity invariants** `[v2]`.
- Phased rollout: pilot offices → cadre-wise → org-wide; bulk-drive & counselling features enabled after pilot sign-off.
- Go/No-Go gates: SR/outbox health ≥ 99.9% in pilot; **zero custody-integrity and zero un-overridden-violation exceptions** `[v2]`; UAT sign-off by Transfer Authority + SR Custodian.
- Rollback: feature-flag disable of write paths; **outbox drains before cutover**; backups verified (RPO ≤ 15min).

### 13.3 Training & support
- Role-based guides (employee self-service, clearance/estate officer, HR, authority, presiding officer).
- In-app contextual help on each wizard; SR/outbox reconciliation runbook; **forced-action & hold runbook for Authorities** `[v2]`.

### 14.2 Dependency / build order `[v2 — representation elevated to baseline, map deferred]`
1. **Foundation:** entity migrations; policy/ban/SLA/distance-band seed; **`order_number_sequences` seed**; order templates; **calendar service contract** wired.
2. **FR-TRJ-012** (`sr_outbox` — frozen contract) — prerequisite for all side effects.
3. **FR-TRJ-002** (eligibility, strength read-through) — prerequisite for 001/003/004.
4. **FR-TRJ-001** (request intake, sensitive docs).
5. **FR-TRJ-004** (orders, gapless numbering) + **FR-TRJ-020** (proof-of-service) → **FR-TRJ-006** (clearance + SLA), **FR-TRJ-007** (handover), **FR-TRJ-016** (forced actions).
6. **FR-TRJ-008** (relieving + pay-continuity) + **FR-TRJ-015** (service continuity & custody) → **FR-TRJ-009** (transit, calendar) → **FR-TRJ-010** (joining) + **FR-TRJ-021** (joining-sequence) + **FR-TRJ-018** (abandonment).
7. **FR-TRJ-017** (representation/stay-hold) — **baseline**, layered across order lifecycle.
8. **FR-TRJ-003/005/019** (counselling/drives) on 002/004.
9. **FR-TRJ-011** (deputation), **FR-TRJ-022** (estate), **FR-TRJ-013** (corrections), **FR-TRJ-014 analytics** (baseline) — **map view deferred to Phase-2**.

### 14.3 Parallel-agent plan `[v2 — single state-service owner]`
| Agent | Owns FRs | Shared contracts to honour |
|---|---|---|
| Agent A (Intake & Policy) | FR-TRJ-001, 002 | request/eligibility API + canonical enums; strength read-through client |
| Agent B (Orders, Numbering, Service, Drives, Counselling) | FR-TRJ-003, 004, 005, 019, 020 | order entity, **`order_number_sequences`**, `order_acknowledgements`, `vacancy_reservations`, `sr_outbox` writer |
| Agent C (Relieving, Clearance, Handover, Forced-Action) | FR-TRJ-006, 007, 008, 016, 022 | clearance/handover/relieving/quarter entities, M10 signal client (**consumes `TransferOrderStateService`, does not write status**) |
| Agent D (Transit, Joining, Continuity, Sequence, Abandonment) | FR-TRJ-009, 010, 015, 018, 021 | M01 client, M10 pay-continuity, calendar client, joining-sequence feed (**consumes `TransferOrderStateService`**) |
| Agent E (SR/Outbox, Deputation, Corrections, Representation, Analytics) | FR-TRJ-011, 012, 013, 017, 014 | `sr_outbox`, reversal orchestrator, representation/hold, read models |
| **Shared service (owned by Agent B, consumed by C/D/E)** | **`TransferOrderStateService`** | **Sole writer of `transfer_orders.status`** — eliminates the v1 shared-write conflict (Risk 5) |

Shared interface contracts (entities §5, error catalog §8.2, state tables §10, `sr_outbox` §5.2.15, `TransferOrderStateService` §16.6) are frozen before parallel work.

## 15. Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Transfer order | Sanctioned, numbered (gapless) statutory document moving an employee from source to destination office. |
| Order class | Classification of an order: `SUBSTANTIVE`, `ADDITIONAL_CHARGE`, `DEPUTATION`, `REPATRIATION`; only one substantive transition may be active per employee. |
| Proof-of-service | Recorded service of the order on the employee (channel + date) on which relieve-by deadlines rest. |
| Relieving | Formal release of an employee from the source office after clearance and handover (or deemed action). |
| No-dues / clearance | Departmental certification (configured departments) that no dues/assets are outstanding; may be cleared, with-dues, waived, or deemed-cleared. |
| Deemed clearance | Authority-granted clearance after SLA + escalation when an officer is non-responsive. |
| Charge handover/assumption | Transfer of duties, records, assets and cash from relinquishing to receiving officer; may be under protest. |
| Last Working Day (LWD) | Final day of duty at source; basis for transit computation (pay is continued, not stopped). |
| Forenoon / Afternoon (FN/AN) relieving | Whether the day counts as source duty or transit — load-bearing for pay and seniority (§16.9). |
| In-transit custody | The single office owning pay/attendance/headcount/discipline of an employee during `IN_TRANSIT`. |
| Service continuity | Treatment of the transit/joining-time period as continuous paid service with no break in qualifying service. |
| Joining time | Statutorily admissible working days (by distance band, contracted calendar) allowed to travel and join — paid. |
| Joining report | Document by which a transferee reports and assumes duty at destination, fixing the joining date. |
| Joining sequence | Inter-se order among same-cadre/post joiners on a date; sets seniority consumed by M06. |
| Representation / stay-order / retention hold | A filing that pauses an order (`STAY_HOLD`) pre-join. |
| Abandonment | Non-joining beyond grace; breaks continuity and triggers M09. |
| Transit period | Time between LWD and joining date; bounded by admissible joining time; paid. |
| Mutual transfer | Reciprocal exchange of two employees; coupled through approval, relieving and joining. |
| Deputation / Repatriation | Temporary posting to a borrowing org with defined tenure / return to lending org. |
| Ban/freeze period (MCC) | Window (e.g. election Model Code of Conduct) during which transfers are restricted. |
| Sanctioned strength | Authorised number of posts (owned by M06/M01; read-through by M05). |
| LPC | Last Pay Certificate issued by source payroll on relieving. |
| Imprest / DDO charge | Standing cash advance held by an officer / Drawing-and-Disbursing-Officer responsibilities handed over. |

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Sequence (happy path, narrative) `[v2]`
Request → eligibility pass (strength read-through) → recommend → Authority approve → **reserve-then-commit gapless order_no** + PDF → publish (SR TRANSFER_ORDERED via outbox, clearance created) → **serve order on employee + acknowledgement** → departments clear (SLA-bounded; deemed if needed) → handover accepted (or under-protest) → relieving order + LWD (**pay-continuity** + LPC, SR RELIEVED asserting no break, **custodian set**, reservation vacated) → IN_TRANSIT (paid joining-time clock, contracted calendar) → report at destination → charge assumption → confirm joining (**reservation re-check + fill**, pay-continuity resumes, M01 update, **joining-sequence assigned**, SR JOINED) — with representation/stay-holds and abandonment as first-class branches.

### 16.2 Office clearance-department default config
IT, LIBRARY, ACCOUNTS, STORES, ADVANCES, ESTATE_QUARTERS, HR — **configurable per office; an office may configure fewer (only configured departments generate items; zero departments → checklist auto-CLEARED)**; an office may add `OTHER` named departments.

### 16.3 Outbox & idempotency note `[v2]`
External signals (M10 pay-continuity/entitlement/LPC/licence-fee, M12 SR, M01 posting, M09 trigger) are written to `sr_outbox` (§5.2.15) in the same DB transaction as the local state change and dispatched asynchronously. **Idempotency key formula:** `{target_system}:{event_type}:{aggregate_type}:{aggregate_id}:{revision_no}`. Backoff is exponential to `max_attempts` (default 8); exhausted rows are `DEAD_LETTERED` (retained ≥ 180 days) and surfaced in the SR Reconciliation Console (FR-TRJ-012).

### 16.4 Joining-time by distance band `[v2]`
Joining time is computed from `joining_distance_band` against the **contracted Platform Calendar Service** (regional working days), not a flat `joining_time_days`. Seeded defaults (System-Administrator-configurable):
| Band | Indicative distance | Default joining time (working days) |
|---|---|---|
| LOCAL | same station | 0 |
| SHORT | < 200 km | 3 |
| MEDIUM | 200–500 km | 5 |
| LONG | 500–1000 km | 7 |
| OUTSTATION | > 1000 km / external | 10 + travel |

### 16.5 Open configuration parameters
Minimum-tenure months, near-retirement window, cooling period, **joining-time distance bands**, **clearance SLA hours + escalation tiers per department**, **dispute-resolution SLA**, **deemed-action policy**, deputation max tenure, drive preference window, **counselling turn timeout**, **order-number prefix templates per office**, **licence-fee normal/penal rates & permissible retention months**, **late-joining grace** — all System-Administrator-configurable with seeded defaults.

### 16.6 `TransferOrderStateService` contract `[v2]`
The **sole writer** of `transfer_orders.status`. Exposes guarded transition methods (`approve`, `publish`, `serve`, `hold`, `vacateHold`, `startRelieving`, `relieve`, `enterTransit`, `confirmJoining`, `revertToSource`, `abandon`, `amend`, `cancel`, `revoke`), each validating the §10.1 guards (incl. hold supremacy 5.6-16, served precedence 5.6-15, custody 5.6-12, mutual coupling 5.6-5) and writing `audit_log`. Agents C/D/E consume it; none writes the column directly — eliminating the v1 multi-writer conflict (Risk 5).

### 16.7 Gapless statutory numbering `[v2]`
Numbers are issued via **reserve-then-commit** on `order_number_sequences` (row-locked per `scope`/`office`/`fiscal_year`): (1) reserve `next_value` inside the order transaction; (2) on successful PDF render + commit, advance `next_value`; (3) on failure, the reserved value is **voided with an explicit audit row** so a gap-audit report shows zero unexplained gaps. Never "retry sequence on collision".

### 16.8 Acceptance tests for new invariants `[v2]`
| AT | Invariant | Oracle |
|---|---|---|
| AT-PAY-CONTINUITY | Relieve→join produces **no pay gap** | M10 receives one `PAY_CONTINUITY` (no `PAY_STOP`); no unpaid interval between LWD and joining_date |
| AT-CUSTODY | No dual/zero posting | While `IN_TRANSIT`, exactly one `in_transit_custody_org_unit_id`; headcount counts once; null/two → `TRJ_DUAL_POSTING_BLOCKED` |
| AT-ENTITLEMENT | Entitlement keyed by type+ground | Own-request vs administrative produce different `ENTITLEMENT` payloads |
| AT-DEEMED-CLEAR | Forced-action audit | `DEEMED_CLEARED` requires SLA+escalation exhausted, reason+actor recorded, queryable |
| AT-DEEMED-RELIEF | Deemed-relief unblocks | Relieving issuable with `deemed_relief=true` + reason; precondition 5.6-2 satisfied |
| AT-MUTUAL | Mutual coupling | Asymmetric completion blocked (`TRJ_MUTUAL_PAIR_BLOCKED`) at relieve/join |
| AT-SERVED | Served-date precedence | Relieving blocked without service (`TRJ_ORDER_NOT_SERVED`); relieve_by from served date |
| AT-GAPLESS | Gapless numbering under concurrency | 1000 concurrent orders → contiguous numbers, zero gaps/dups; voided reservations audited |
| AT-VACANCY | Join-time re-check | Cascading-vacancy double-fill blocked at join (`TRJ_VACANCY_FULL`) |
| AT-HOLD | Hold supremacy | Active `STAY_HOLD` blocks all forward transitions (`TRJ_STAY_HOLD_ACTIVE`) |
| AT-ABANDON | Continuity break recorded | `ABANDONED` sets `service_continuity_asserted=false` + M09 trigger + defined pay status |
| AT-SEQUENCE | Inter-se determinism | Same-date same-post joiners get distinct contiguous sequence by reported_date→FN/AN→service_no |
| AT-OVERRIDE | Un-overridden-violation KPI | Valid overrides NOT flagged as violations; un-overridden violations = 0 |
| AT-COUNSELLING | Single live turn | Out-of-turn choice → `TRJ_COUNSELLING_TURN_VIOLATION`; choice log immutable |
| AT-SENSITIVE | Sensitive-doc access logging | Every read of a sensitive-ground document writes an access-log row |
| AT-OUTBOX | Idempotent delivery | Duplicate dispatch deduped by key; dead-letter after max_attempts; reconciliation surfaces it |
| AT-LICENCE-FEE | Estate recovery | Overstay flips penal rate + emits `LICENCE_FEE_RECOVERY` to M10 |

### 16.9 Domain Primer `[v2]`
For implementers without Indian enterprise HR background:
- **LPC (Last Pay Certificate):** statement from source payroll certifying pay drawn up to LWD; the destination needs it to start/continue salary correctly. M05 *requests* it; M10 *issues* it.
- **No-dues / clearance:** each department (IT, Library, Accounts, Stores, Advances, Estate) certifies the employee owes nothing (no unreturned laptop, books, advances, stores, accommodation). Required before relieving.
- **Imprest / DDO charge:** an **imprest** is a standing petty-cash advance an officer holds; a **DDO (Drawing & Disbursing Officer)** is responsible for drawing and disbursing enterprise money. On transfer these must be reconciled and handed over.
- **MCC (Model Code of Conduct):** during elections, a ban window freezes transfers (a `transfer_ban_period`).
- **Cadre:** a defined service group/stream (e.g. Teaching, Ministerial); transfer drives are run cadre-wise.
- **Officiating:** holding a higher post on an acting basis pending regular promotion.
- **Forenoon / Afternoon (FN/AN) relieving — *why it matters*:** an employee relieved in the **forenoon** is treated as **not on duty at source that day** (the day counts toward transit), whereas **afternoon** relieving counts the day as **source duty**. This one bit therefore shifts the LWD/transit boundary, which affects **pay** (which office pays that day) and **seniority/joining-time** computation. It is load-bearing, not cosmetic — hence an explicit enum and acceptance coverage.
- **Deputation / Repatriation:** lending an employee to a borrowing organisation for a fixed tenure (deputation) and bringing them back (repatriation); modelled as co-existing `DEPUTATION`/`REPATRIATION` order classes.
- **Transit / joining time:** the paid period to travel and join; not unpaid dead time (a core v2 correction).
