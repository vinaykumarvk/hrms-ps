# PH-33 (Remediation Tranche 20) — Human-Gate Verdict

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Chains from:** `docs/spec/ph-32-verdict.md` (tranche 19)
**Baseline:** `docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md`
**Branch:** ph02-rerun (merged to main per sub-phase)

## Suite evidence (oracle-recomputed)

- API `npm test`: **488 pass**, 0 fail, 1 skipped (DATABASE_URL-gated PH-06 persistence test).
- Web `npm run web:test`: **127 pass**, 0 fail.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run web:typecheck`: green.

All three PH-33A..C oracles were run **externally** by the driver and are GREEN — the sixth (final)
route-exposure pass. Built by hand — subagents credit-exhausted until 2026-07-08.

> **GREEN here is necessary, not sufficient.** Human review required before advancing.

## What tranche 20 closed — the route-exposure backlog is now cleared

| Module | Routes added | Backing service |
|---|---|---|
| **PS02** | `change-requests/{id}/e-signatures`, `change-request-templates` | `changeEsignStepUp` (PH-17B), `changeRequestTemplate` (PH-20C) |
| **PS03** | `atl/punch-anomaly:screen` | `punchAnomaly` (PH-25C) |
| **PS07** | `training/learning-record-stores` | `lmsIntegration` (PH-21A) |
| **PS08** | `apar/360-feedback` | `feedback360` (PH-21B) |
| **PS11** | `pension/grievances` | `pensionTreasury` (PH-16F) |
| **PS14** | `analytics/fairness-report` | `predictiveAnalytics` (PH-26C) |

Across PH-28..PH-33 (six passes), every service built in PH-15E..PH-26 that was service+test complete
but not yet route-exposed now has at least one `/api/v1` route reachable and API-tested end-to-end.

## Remaining gaps (still open — this is NOT a 100% claim)

The residual is now down to a small, specific list:

- **UI surfaces:** PS01 privacy/DPDP console, PS06 sealed-cover UI, PS14 embedded BI / mobile briefing.
- **Deep engine depth:** PS10 remaining TDS edge cases + Form-16 Part-A remittance matching depth;
  PS09 POSH conciliation depth; PS04 CI port-conformance gate in the build pipeline.
- **Persistence:** the newest hand-built services (PH-16F..PH-33 engines) use in-memory repositories;
  Postgres-backed repos + migrations for these remain a deferred workstream, and the `ph06-persistence`
  migration-list assertion froze at 0008.

**Contract-op coverage caveat:** even with the route-exposure passes, implemented routes still cover
only a fraction of the **1,306** OpenAPI operations frozen in `docs/contracts/openapi/*.yaml` — the
contract enumerates far more operations (per-field CRUD, admin/config surfaces, report variants) than
the core behavioral routes shipped.

## Recommendation for the human reviewer

Approve PH-33D, OR direct a further tranche (PH-34). With route-exposure cleared, the next workstreams
are the three UI surfaces and the deep-engine items above. Carried debt (unchanged): in-memory
repositories for the newest services; the `ph06-persistence` migration-list assertion froze at 0008.
