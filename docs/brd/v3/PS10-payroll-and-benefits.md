# Payroll and Benefits Management — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS10, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Module code:** PS10 (alias PS-M10; supersedes the `M10-PAY` code from `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` §1 per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §B)
**Program:** Enterprise / Public-Sector HRMS — a **Phase-2 extension of the PrimeSoft HRMS platform**
**Platform relationship (per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A):** **SPANS-MULTIPLE / EXTEND (roadmap).** PrimeSoft Phase-1 **excludes payroll** (Master BRD v2.1 §2.1.3, §2.2: M06 Payroll, M07 Statutory Compliance, M14 Benefits are Phase 2/3). PS10 is therefore built as a **platform-native Phase-2 module** that EXTENDS the PrimeSoft M06/M07/M14 roadmap with public-sector pay scales, allowances, and statutory rules — **not** authored as a parallel payroll engine.
**Authoring standard:** World-class global HCM (Workday / SAP SuccessFactors / Oracle HCM bar) honouring Indian public-sector statutory payroll rules, **re-grounded onto the PrimeSoft platform contracts**.
**Source of truth (authority order):** `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` and `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` (which together **supersede** the invented `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`), grounded in **Master BRD v2.1 · Product Vision v2.6 · Platform Specification v1.6 · RBAC Design v1.7 · Foundation FS v1.6**. This BRD **consumes** platform contracts by id (P01–P06, X.1–X.3, W.1–W.3, RBAC v1.7, VAL-*/MSG-*/ERR-*) and never re-authors them.
**Document version:** v3.1 (cross-module SR remediation; v3.0 platform re-grounded)
**Supersedes:** v2.0 (`docs/brd/v2/M10-payroll-and-benefits.md`); v1.0 (`docs/brd/v1/M10-payroll-and-benefits.md`)
**Revision basis:** v3 preserves **all** v2 content and rigor (the v1→v2 Adversarial Council improvements AI-1…AI-24 and risk mitigations R1–R19 remain intact) and **re-anchors** every cross-cutting concern — workflow, RBAC, audit, notifications, jobs, migration, integrations, API conventions, tenancy, NFR — onto the existing PrimeSoft platform engines. See **§15 Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform** and the **Amendments (v2 → v3)** table below.
**Status:** Draft for Gate A review (platform-grounded)
**Sequencing:** Phase-2. PS10 sequences **after the Phase-2 platform payroll substrate (PrimeSoft M06/M07) is live** (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §E), and after the Phase-1 platform (P01–P06, X, W, RBAC) is operational.

## Amendments (v2 → v3: platform re-grounding)

This table records every change made to re-ground the v2 BRD onto the PrimeSoft platform. The **business spine is unchanged** — determinism, immutability, three-way + disbursed/held/failed tie-out, derived-YTD ledger, snapshot contract, DSC/positive-pay disbursement, remittance-to-MATCHED, FnF, perquisites, dependent-allowance cascade are all preserved verbatim. v3 changes only *what platform substrate the spine runs on*.

These changes converge the PS10→PS12 Service-Register contract onto the **frozen PS12 SR ingestion contract** (`docs/review/REMEDIATION.md` §D1/§D2; R1 findings F-02, F-09, F-14). PS10 remains **Phase-2 / deferred build**; only the *posting contract* is authored now so the edge is specified rather than "effectively unspecified". The business spine is unchanged.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Payroll and Benefits Management module (**PS10**) is the financial heart of the PrimeSoft HRMS and the lead **Phase-2** statutory-financial module on the PrimeSoft platform. It computes, controls, and disburses employee compensation each pay cycle; administers statutory deductions, loans, advances, perquisites, and benefits; **tracks every statutory deduction through to its actual deposit with the State (challan/CIN) and its posting to the books**; and produces every downstream financial and compliance artefact (payslips, bank disbursement files, statutory remittance schedules, Form-16/Form-24Q/tax statements, payroll registers, cost-to-organisation analytics, and full-and-final settlements). It publishes pay events to the **Digital Service Register (PS12)** — which runs on the **P05 audit/immutability substrate** — and feeds terminal-benefit and pension processing in **PS11**.

PS10 is engineered as a **configurable, rule-driven, audit-grade payroll *system of record*** — not merely a calculator — **running on the PrimeSoft platform engines**: approvals/locking on **P01**, authorization/SoD on **P02**, audit on **P05**, jobs on **X.1**, notifications on **X.2**, bank/portal/GL integrations on **X.3**, and migration on **P06 wave 3**. Pay is never hand-keyed into a ledger; it is *derived* from a versioned salary structure, a **point-in-time cross-module snapshot** of upstream facts (PS01 master/bank/PAN/scheme, PS03 attendance, PS06 fixation, PS09 recovery, org unit), and a deterministic computation pipeline. Once a payroll run is **finalised and locked, it is immutable** (enforced by P05 DB-trigger audit and append-only versioning) — corrections flow only through arrears, supplementary, off-cycle, or reopen-with-versioning runs, never through silent edits. Every rupee is traceable from snapshotted input → computed payslip → disbursed credit → **deposited statutory remittance → posted GL journal**, and is reversible only through a controlled adjustment with full audit.

The boundary of PS10 is **"compute + disburse + remit-to-State + post-to-GL-status"** — surgically wider than a calculator (it proves money was correctly *paid*, *remitted*, and *booked*, through to every employee's *exit*) but stopping short of becoming a general ledger.

### 1.2 Business Context and Problem Statement

Enterprise payroll combines high volume with extreme regulatory sensitivity: pay matrices and scales (e.g., 7th CPC-style pay levels), Dearness Allowance (DA) revisions issued retrospectively, House Rent Allowance (HRA) by city class, GPF/CPF/NPS contributions, income-tax (TDS) with employee declarations, proofs, perquisites, surcharge/cess/relief, professional tax slabs **that differ by state of posting**, recoveries ordered by disciplinary authorities, statutory remittances under tight deadlines **that must be deposited and matched, not merely scheduled**, and full-and-final settlements for every separation. Manual or spreadsheet-driven payroll produces reconciliation gaps, over/under-payments, **duplicate disbursements**, YTD drift, audit findings, and litigation. PS10 eliminates these by making the rule set explicit and versioned, the run reproducible from a defined snapshot, the disbursement double-payment-proof, the YTD an immutable derived ledger, and the controls enforceable — **all on platform substrate so the controls are platform-uniform, not module-bespoke**.

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives

| # | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Deterministic, reproducible monthly payroll | Re-running an unlocked cycle with identical inputs **and the same cross-module snapshot** yields byte-identical results |
| G2 | Statutory accuracy **through deposit** | 100% correct DA/HRA/PT/TDS/GPF/NPS/perquisite computation against published rules; zero statutory-deadline misses **proven against actual challan/CIN deposit, not just schedule generation** |
| G3 | Immutable, auditable finalised runs | No mutation of locked runs; every adjustment traceable to an arrear/supplementary/off-cycle/reopen-version entry with a lock-to-lock diff, captured by **P05 DB-trigger** audit |
| G4 | Reconciliation integrity (extended) | Gross = sum(earnings); Net = Gross − sum(deductions); **Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net** — reconciled before disbursement; YTD ties to the immutable line ledger |
| G5 | Self-service | Employees access payslips, tax declarations, Form-16, loan statements, FnF status without HR intervention (P02-scoped, P03 chat for policy Q&A) |
| G6 | Retrospective correctness | Arrears for back-dated DA/increment/pay-fixation computed automatically with full break-up and **dependent-allowance cascade**, with cross-FY relief via Form-10E |
| G7 | Cost transparency | Cost-to-organisation analytics by org unit, cadre, component, and period, including employer cost; feeds **PS14** dashboards |
| G8 | No duplicate / no missing money | No double disbursement on resend (positive-pay guard over **X.3**); no net pay leaves the tie-out silently (suspense ledger) |
| G9 | Lifecycle completeness | Every employee's exit is settled through a single consolidated full-and-final run; pension/terminal-benefit handoff to **PS11** |
| PS10 | **Platform-native** | Every cross-cutting concern runs on a named platform service (P01/P02/P05/P06, X.1–X.3, W.1–W.3); PS10 authors **only public-sector payroll business logic** |

### 1.4 Scope Summary

In scope: salary structure & pay rules engine (constrained, versioned DSL); monthly payroll run engine with parallel/what-if runs and a **single-in-flight-run guarantee**; **cross-module point-in-time snapshot contract** (over PS01/PS03/PS06/PS09/org); arrears & retrospective revisions with dependent-allowance cascade; supplementary & off-cycle payroll; LWP/leave-based deductions; subsistence-allowance and dies-non handling; statutory deductions (TDS, PT-by-state, GPF/PF, NPS, pension contribution, insurance); **taxable perquisite valuation (Rule 3, incl. concessional-loan perquisite)**; full TDS pipeline (standard deduction → Chapter VI-A → slab → surcharge with marginal relief → 4% cess → 87A rebate → 89(1)/Form-10E relief → previous-employer/Form-12B income); recoveries with legal-eligibility check; loans & advances; benefits administration incl. **leave encashment**; payslip generation **with reopen versioning**; bank disbursement (over **X.3**) with **DSC/HSM signature, bank-side batch reference, positive-pay reconciliation, and a suspense-hold ledger**; payroll register & reconciliation; **statutory remittance & liability tracking (deducted → deposited → matched) and GL cost-journal posting status**; Form-16/Form-24Q/tax statements; full-and-final settlement; approval, locking & reopen-versioning **on P01**; feeds to PS11 and PS12.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): the canonical employee master (**PS01** — PrimeSoft M01), attendance/leave capture (**PS03** — PrimeSoft M04/M05), pension disbursement after retirement (**PS11**), the SR ledger itself (**PS12**, on P05 substrate), document storage internals (**PS13** — PrimeSoft M11), the **general-ledger book of record** (PS10 produces the cost journal and tracks its posting status; Finance's ERP owns the GL), and **all platform engines** (P01–P06, X, W) which PS10 consumes by id and never re-implements.

### 1.5 Key Stakeholders

Payroll Officer (maker), Payroll Approver (checker), Payroll Disburser (DSC-sign/transmit), HR Admin, Department Head/Drawing & Disbursing Officer (DDO), Finance/Treasury (Finance Admin), Employee (self-service), Auditor (Org-Admin read + entitlement), Organisation Admin / Platform Super Admin (configuration). All expressed within **RBAC v1.7** (see §3).

### 1.6 Success Criteria

A pay cycle is "successful" when: all eligible active employees are computed from a frozen cross-module snapshot; reconciliation balances to zero variance with `disbursed + held + failed = run net`; the run is approved and locked **on P01** (approver ≠ creator, SoD enforced by P02); payslips are published; the bank file is DSC-signed, transmitted once with a unique bank batch reference over **X.3**, and positively reconciled against the treasury debit; statutory schedules are produced **and their remittances deposited, challan-captured, and matched**; the cost journal is exported and its posting acknowledged; and pay events are posted to **PS12** — all within the cycle calendar with a complete **P05** audit trail. A separation is "successful" when the employee's full-and-final settlement nets all dues and recoveries into a single final payment with its own reconciliation and **PS11** handoff.

| Attendance & leave balances | Consume only (**snapshotted**) | **PS03** (LWP days, paid/unpaid splits; PrimeSoft M04 Leave + M05 Attendance) |
| Promotion / pay-fixation order | Consume the order; compute pay impact | **PS06** issues; PS10 fixes pay & computes arrears |

### 2.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- Pay scales, DA rates, HRA city classes, **PT slabs keyed by state**, and tax slabs are **configurable master data**, sourced from enterprise notifications, version-effective-dated via the platform config cascade (`platform → tenant → entity → employee`) and the **`VAL-EFFECTIVE`** / effective-date job mechanism (Platform §0.3, §3.3).
- The enterprise deployment is **one PrimeSoft tenant**; each department/directorate is an **`entity`** (Standalone / Group Company model, Vision §1.4). The data model is tenant- and entity-aware on every table. **Multi-state professional tax** is supported within a single entity via a `state` dimension on PT slabs.
- One primary monthly cycle plus arrears/supplementary/off-cycle/**FnF** cycles per period.
- The bank/treasury accepts **one defined, certified file format per deployment**; ISO20022/CUSTOM deferred behind a strategy seam. The bank file is **digitally signed (DSC/HSM)**; signing keys live in an HSM and **never in the application database**; integration credentials are held in **P04 `integration_credentials`**.
- All money math uses fixed-point decimal (no binary float); rounding rules explicit and configurable; a designated rounding-adjustment component absorbs per-payslip residue.
- **Determinism extends upstream:** a run is a pure function of (salary structure version, effective rate tables, PS10 inputs, prior immutable line ledger, **and the cross-module snapshot** of PS01/PS03/PS06/PS09/org taken as-of the cutoff).
- **YTD is derived, never a mutable scalar.**
- **Phase-2 sequencing:** PS10 goes live after the PrimeSoft Phase-1 platform (P01–P06, X, W, RBAC v1.7) and the Phase-2 payroll substrate (M06/M07) are operational; payroll history migrates on **P06 wave 3 (zero-tolerance)**.

---

## 3. Roles & Permissions (RBAC v1.7 — expressed as ADDITIONS)

PS10 does **not** define a parallel access-control scheme. It maps every actor onto the **RBAC v1.7** taxonomy (Platform §P02; `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6) and expresses public-sector payroll actors as **new entity-scoped roles + capability flags ADDED to the taxonomy** and registered in RBAC §2.2/§4.3. Enforcement (deny-by-default → role grant → multi-role intersection → entitlement → capability flag → **PII Protection Ceiling** → data-scope filter → field mask on serialization) is performed by **P02 `Authorization.check`** — PS10 endpoints never re-implement permission logic. **SoD (maker ≠ checker, signer ≠ creator, no self-approval) is enforced by P01/P02**, not coded per module.

### 3.1 Enterprise payroll roles as RBAC additions

| PS10 actor | Express in RBAC v1.7 as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Payroll Officer (Maker)** | new entity-scoped module-admin role `payroll_officer` (analogous to **Payroll Admin**, RBAC §2.2) | configure components/rules (draft), assign structures, run payroll (draft/parallel), enter adjustments, prepare bank file, capture remittance challans, prepare FnF. **Cannot approve, sign, or confirm positive-pay.** |
| **Payroll Approver / Controller (Checker)** | new entity-scoped role `payroll_approver` + capability flag `PAYROLL_APPROVE` | review reconciliation, **approve & lock runs on P01**, authorise off-cycle/supplementary/FnF, reopen-with-versioning, certify remittances & Form-16. **≠ run creator.** |
| **Payroll Disburser** | new entity-scoped role `payroll_disburser` + capability flag `PAYROLL_DISBURSE` | **DSC-sign** the bank file and transmit over X.3. **Distinct from Officer and Approver** (strict 3-way SoD). |
| Employee (Self-Service) | existing **`employee`** (RBAC §2.4) | view own payslips/structure/loan/benefit/perquisite/FnF; submit declarations/proofs/Form-12B; submit reimbursement/LTC/leave-encashment claims (W.2 forms) |
| Reporting Manager | existing **`l1_manager`** (RBAC §2.3) | recommend/approve reimbursement & benefit claims for direct reports (P01) |
| HR Admin | existing **`hr_admin`** (single-entity superset, RBAC §3.1.1) | maintain pay-relevant attributes within scope; raise pay-fixation requests; initiate separation/FnF |
| Department Head / DDO | existing **`hod`** + capability flag `DDO_SANCTION` | sanction loans/advances; sanction off-cycle/FnF within authority; **adjudicate legally-barred overpayment recovery** |
| Finance / Treasury | existing **`finance_admin`** (Phase-2 payroll approval/payslip per BRD §3.3) | receive bank file & cost journal; confirm disbursement ack & **treasury debit (positive pay)**; acknowledge GL posting; confirm statutory deposits |
| Auditor (read-only) | **map to** Org-Admin audit access + read-only **individual entitlement** (RBAC §3.2; P05 query access) | read all payroll data, registers, remittance ledger, **P05 audit logs**; no write. **Do not invent a parallel Auditor role with write capability.** |
| System Administrator | **map to** Org Admin / Platform Super Admin (RBAC §2.1) | manage master data (scales, DA/HRA/PT-by-state/tax tables), file-format config, DSL grammar version, RBAC; **no transactional self-approval** |

> New roles/flags (`payroll_officer`, `payroll_approver`, `payroll_disburser`, `PAYROLL_APPROVE`, `PAYROLL_DISBURSE`, `DDO_SANCTION`) are registered in **RBAC §2.2/§4.3** via the working-group process (RBAC §14). High-privilege payroll roles require **MFA** by default (Vision §2.2; Foundation §3.1).

### 3.2 Permission Matrix (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, A=Approve/Lock, S=Sign/Disburse, X=No access)

Resolved by **P02** at request time; this matrix is the RBAC-addition request, not a parallel model.

| Capability | Employee | Mgr (L1) | Payroll Officer | Payroll Approver | Payroll Disburser | HR Admin | DDO/HOD | Finance | Auditor | Org/SysAdmin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pay component / rule config | X | X | C/R/U (draft) | A | X | R | X | X | R | C/R/U |

| Audit log (P05) | X | X | R (own actions) | R | X | X | X | X | R | R |

**Segregation of duties (enforced by P01/P02, not coded):** the **Payroll Officer** who runs/prepares cannot approve/lock, **DSC-sign**, or confirm positive-pay; the **Payroll Approver** who locks is **≠ run creator**; the **Payroll Disburser** who DSC-signs/transmits is **≠ run creator and ≠ approver**; the principal who confirms the treasury debit (positive pay) before a resend is **≠ the transmitter**; `fnf_settlements.approved_by ≠ created_by`. The Org/SysAdmin who configures tables **cannot run or approve payroll** for which they are an employee subject. The **PII Protection Ceiling** (bank account, PAN, salary amounts) overrides every role upward — no Org Admin or module admin lifts it; masking is applied **on serialization** by P02.

---

## 4. Platform Foundation (consumed, not re-authored)

PS10 consumes the PrimeSoft platform contracts verbatim (Platform Spec v1.6; Foundation FS v1.6; RBAC v1.7). The invented `SHARED_FOUNDATION` §5 defaults are **overridden** per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C.

- **Tenancy:** `tenant_id` (non-null) + `entity_id` (where entity-scoped) on every PS10 entity; data-layer scoping; unscoped queries rejected (Platform §0.1).
- **Auth/session:** Bearer-token (JWT) session carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; permissions resolved per request by P02; MFA for high-privilege payroll roles (Platform §0.2; Vision §2.2).
- **API conventions:** `/api/v1`; cursor pagination only; `Idempotency-Key` (24h replay window) on payment/run POSTs; `X-Correlation-Id` response header; canonical error envelope + 8-code table (Foundation §1) — see §8.
- **Money type:** `NUMERIC(15,2)` amounts, `NUMERIC(9,4)` rates; fixed-point; a `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` component absorbs `Σ(rounded) − round(Σ)` per payslip.
- **Computation determinism (extended):** pure function of (structure version, effective rate tables, employee inputs, prior immutable line ledger, cross-module snapshot).
- **Cross-module snapshot:** every run persists an immutable `run_input_snapshots` row of as-of values of PS01/PS03/PS06/PS09/org (FR-PS10-22).
- **Immutability & versioning:** finalised runs/payslips are append-only; reopen produces a new payslip *version* (originals → REVERSED) with a lock-to-lock diff recorded in the **P05 `audit_log`**.
- **YTD as derived ledger:** YTD = immutable Σ over `payslip_lines` for the FY; `deductions.cumulative_ytd` is a cache only.
- **Idempotency + single-in-flight:** mutating run/disbursement endpoints accept `Idempotency-Key`; a partial unique index enforces one active FINAL run per cycle.
- **Audit:** **P05 dual logs** (`audit_log` for mutations + `security_audit_log` for auth/permission events), captured by **DB-trigger** (100% coverage, no API bypass), immutable, ≥7-yr retention; tamper-evidence tracks OPEN-PLAT-03 (hash-chain). PS10 defines **no** local `audit_log`.
- **Workflow:** approvals/sanctions/locking run on **P01** (`workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`; 5 patterns; in-flight version pinning); flows are **W.1** definitions, forms are **W.2**, notification recipients **W.3**.
- **Disbursement safety:** bank files DSC/HSM-signed (keys in HSM, never in DB; integration creds in P04); unique bank batch ref + positive-pay reconciliation over **X.3**; excluded/failed net parked in a suspense-hold ledger.
- **Encryption / PII:** bank account, PAN, salary amounts are PII/financial — encrypted at rest, masked in UI by default (P02 ceiling on serialization), access logged in `security_audit_log`.

> v3 **removes** the v2 entries that treated `audit_log`, `notifications`, `service_register_events`, and `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks` as PS10-defined "shared" tables; they are **platform-provided** and consumed by id (Recon §C/§D).

### 5.2 Amended v1 entities (delta) and new v2 entities — unchanged from v2 except tenancy

> All v1 entities E04–E23 retain their full v2 field tables; all v2 entities E29–E35 retain their full v2 field tables. **v3 adds `tenant_id UUID NOT NULL` and (where entity-scoped) `entity_id UUID NOT NULL` to every PS10-owned entity, and replaces the bespoke `audit fields` line with the platform audit columns captured by the P05 DB-trigger.** The field-level content below is reproduced verbatim from v2.

#### E05 `pay_components` — amended
Adds to `category` enum: `PERQUISITE`, `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT`, `LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`. New field `dsl_grammar_version TEXT NULL` (pins the DSL grammar a FORMULA component was authored against; FR-PS10-01/Appendix 16.7). Plus `tenant_id`/`entity_id`.

#### E07 `rate_tables` — amended
Adds field `state TEXT NULL` (required when `table_type=PT_SLAB`). Uniqueness/non-overlap key for PT: `(tenant_id, entity_id, table_type, state, slab_min, slab_max, effective_from)`.

#### E11 `payroll_runs` — amended
Adds: `snapshot_id UUID FK→run_input_snapshots NULL`; `in_flight_lock_key TEXT NULL` (partial unique index enforces one active FINAL run per `(tenant_id, entity_id, cycle_id)`); `superseded_run_id UUID NULL`; `workflow_instance_id UUID NULL` (the P01 instance driving approval/lock).

#### E12 `payslips` — amended
Adds: `version INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1`; `superseded_by_payslip_id UUID FK→payslips NULL`; `supersession_reason ENUM(REOPEN, ARREAR_LINK, CORRECTION) NULL`; `snapshot_id UUID FK→run_input_snapshots NULL`; `document_id` references the **PS13** vault. `status` enum gains `SUPERSEDED`.

#### E14 `deductions` — amended
`cumulative_ytd` demoted to recomputable cache. Adds: `carryforward_id UUID FK→deduction_carryforwards NULL`; `attachment_exemption_basis TEXT NULL` (CPC s.60).

#### E15 `tax_declarations` — amended
Adds: `previous_employer_income JSONB NULL` (Form-12B); `relief_89_1 JSONB NULL` (Form-10E); `surcharge`, `marginal_relief`, `cess`, `rebate_87a`, `standard_deduction`, `perquisite_total` `NUMERIC(15,2) NULL`.

#### E16 `loans_advances` — amended
Adds: `is_concessional BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT false`; `perquisite_reference_rate NUMERIC(9,4) NULL`; `perquisite_id UUID FK→perquisites NULL`. Loan sanction routes through **P01** (`workflow_instance_id`).

#### E29 `statutory_remittances`
| Field | Type | Null | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `remittance_id` | UUID PK | N | |
| `tenant_id` / `entity_id` | UUID | N | platform scoping |

### 5.4 Ownership / Reuse Matrix

### 5.5 Enum Catalog (delta from v1 — unchanged in v3)

Identical to v2: `pay_component.category` adds `PERQUISITE, ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT, LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`; `rate_table.table_type` PT_SLAB +state; `cycle.run_type` adds `FNF`; `run.run_mode` DRAFT/PARALLEL_WHATIF/FINAL; `payslip.status` adds `SUPERSEDED`; `disbursement.status` adds `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`; `disbursement.file_format` NACH/FIXED_WIDTH active, ISO20022/CUSTOM DEFERRED; `disbursement.ack_status` adds `POSITIVE_PAY_CONFIRMED`; `hold.reason`/`hold.status`; `remittance.scheme`/`remittance.status`; `perquisite.perq_type`; `gl_journal.posting_status`; `fnf.separation_type`/`fnf.status`; `carryforward.status`; `benefit/claim.type` adds `LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`. (All values exactly as v2 §5.5.)

### 5.6 Data Integrity Rules (v2 rules preserved verbatim; audit now via P05)

1. **Earning/deduction identity** with `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` line absorbing residue (net ≥ 0).
2. **Run totals** equal sums of non-superseded payslips; enforced at commit.
3. **Reconciliation gate:** APPROVED requires `payroll_reconciliations.signoff_status=SIGNED_OFF` + zero unexplained variance.
4. **Bank-file integrity:** `Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = payroll_runs.net_total`; excluded net parked in `disbursement_holds`.
5. **Immutability & versioning:** LOCKED runs are read-only; change requires arrear/supplementary/off-cycle or reopen-versioning (original → SUPERSEDED/REVERSED).
6. **Effective-dating:** one ACTIVE structure version per employee per date; overlaps rejected.
7. **Statutory caps:** GPF/NPS/gratuity/PT/perquisite respect configured ceilings.
8. **Loan ledger:** `Σ loan_repayments.principal = loans_advances.principal` at CLOSED; outstanding monotonically non-increasing.
9. **YTD derivation:** YTD = immutable Σ `payslip_lines` over surviving (non-superseded) versions; `cumulative_ytd` is a cache; Form-16/24Q derive from the ledger.
10. **SoD (enforced by P01/P02):** `payroll_runs.approved_by ≠ created_by`; `bank_disbursements.signed_by ≠ creator ≠ approver`; positive-pay confirmer ≠ transmitter; `fnf_settlements.approved_by ≠ created_by`.
11. **One structure + snapshot per payslip:** `structure_version_ref` + `snapshot_id`.
12. **FK integrity & soft delete:** no hard delete (platform-wide); employee with open loan/deduction/carryforward/FnF cannot be soft-closed.
13. **Single-in-flight run:** partial unique index / advisory lock; second concurrent FINAL → `ERR-PS10-RUN-INFLIGHT` (409).
14. **Remittance reconciliation:** `deducted_total = Σ payslip_lines` per scheme/period; MATCHED only when deposit ties within tolerance; OVERDUE past due date; late interest computed.
15. **GL balance:** `total_debit = total_credit`; net-pay clearing line = `Σ disbursed + Σ held`.
16. **Snapshot determinism:** FINAL run records `snapshot.checksum`; re-run reproduces identical payslips.
17. **Perquisite into tax:** every ACTIVE `perquisites.taxable_value` included in `tax_declarations.perquisite_total`; concessional loan must have a linked perquisite.
18. **Carryforward conservation:** `outstanding = original − recovered ≥ 0`; recovery never exceeds ordered amount.

> Audit-trail integrity for all 18 rules is provided by the **P05 DB-trigger** (no application path can suppress an audit row), not by application-level audit writes.

### 5.7 Sample Data

v2 sample rows retained (rate_tables PT-by-state; statutory_remittances; fnf_settlements; disbursement_holds; perquisites; gl_journals; deduction_carryforwards; run_input_snapshots header) — now each row additionally carries `tenant_id`/`entity_id`. (Values exactly as v2 §5.7.)

## 6. Functional Requirements

> Each FR retains its v2 structure (ID, Module, Roles, User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Business Rules, Data Model References, API References, UI Behaviour, Edge Cases, LLD). v3 re-grounds: approvals/locking on **P01**; authorization/SoD on **P02**; audit on **P05**; jobs `JOB-PS10-*` on **X.1**; notifications `MSG-PS10-*` on **X.2**; bank/portal/ERP calls on **X.3** (creds in **P04**); upstream PS01/PS03/PS06/PS09; downstream PS11/PS12/PS13; platform error codes (`ERR-PS10-*` + 8-code table). All 22 FRs (18 v1 + FR-19…22) preserved.

### FR-PS10-01 — Pay Component & Rules Engine Configuration (constrained, versioned DSL)

- **Module:** PS10-F01 / PS10-F02
- **Primary Role(s):** Org/SysAdmin (config), Payroll Approver (approve via P01)
- **User Story:** As an Administrator, I want to define earning/deduction/perquisite components and their versioned computation rules — against a **pinned, independently-versioned DSL grammar** — so that payroll math is configurable without code changes, fully auditable (P05), and the formula escape hatch is bounded and safe.
- **Description:** Maintain `pay_components` and `pay_rules` (formula DSL, calc method, eligibility, rounding, computation order, effective dates). Rules versioned; the safe expression evaluator (Appendix 16.7) pins decimal/null/precedence semantics and a whitelisted token/function set; the DSL grammar carries its own `dsl_grammar_version`. The `FORMULA` escape hatch is restricted to vetted, property-tested expressions. **Activation is a maker-checker flow configured on P01 (W.1).**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A component can be created with type, category (incl. `PERQUISITE`, `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT`, `LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`), calc method, taxable flag, display order.
  - AC2: A rule version with an invalid expression (unknown reference, unbalanced parens, disallowed token, ambiguous precedence, null-yielding reference) is rejected (`ERR-PS10-RULE-EXPR`, 422) with line/column.
  - AC3: Activating a rule version sets `effective_to` on the prior ACTIVE version to one day before the new `effective_from`; no overlap.
  - AC4: Computation order unique within an effective window; forward references rejected (no circular refs).
  - AC5: All changes require **Payroll Approver** approval via a **P01** maker-checker instance before ACTIVE.
  - AC6: A FORMULA component records `dsl_grammar_version`; a grammar upgrade re-validates/quarantines existing FORMULA rules.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: A component referenced by an active structure cannot be deleted, only deactivated. BR2: `is_statutory=true` deductions cannot be overridden below statutory by a Payroll Officer (P02). BR3: Formula references resolved in `computation_order`; forward refs rejected. BR4: DSL property tests must pass before a FORMULA rule activates.
- **Data Model References:** `pay_components`, `pay_rules`, `rate_tables`; audit via **P05** (DB-trigger).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/components` | create component |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/components/{id}/rules` | add rule version |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/rules/{id}:activate` | activate (P01 checker) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/components` | list (cursor-paginated) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/dsl/grammar` | current DSL grammar version & token set |

- **UI Behaviour:** Rule editor with live validation, "test against sample employee" trace panel, version timeline, DSL-grammar badge; activation gated for makers (P02). W.2 form for component metadata.
- **Edge Cases:** Circular refs; activating a rule whose `rate_table` has no effective row; deactivating mid-FY; grammar-version upgrade invalidating an in-use FORMULA rule.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RuleConfigController`, `ExpressionParser` (grammar-versioned), `RuleVersionService`, `ComponentRepository`, `DslPropertyTestRunner` |
| Backend Flow | Validate → parse to AST against pinned grammar → static-check refs & order → property tests → persist DRAFT → on activate, **P01 SoD/checker** + close prior version + set ACTIVE in a transaction |

### FR-PS10-02 — Pay Scale / Matrix & Statutory Rate Table Management (PT by state)

- **Module:** PS10-F01
- **Primary Role(s):** Org/SysAdmin, Payroll Approver
- **User Story:** As an Administrator, I want to maintain pay-matrix levels and effective-dated statutory rate tables (DA%, HRA class %, **PT slabs keyed by state**, tax slabs, GPF/NPS rates) so revisions apply automatically from their effective date, including for multi-state employees, using the platform **effective-date** mechanism (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`, Foundation §1/§3.3).
- **Description:** CRUD for `pay_matrix_levels` and `rate_tables`, all effective-dated. PT slabs carry a `state` dimension resolved from the snapshotted state of posting. A DA revision is entered once and applies from `effective_from` (retrospective → arrears via FR-10).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Past-dated DA accepted and flagged "retrospective — will generate arrears". AC2: Overlapping effective rows for same `(tenant,entity,table_type,state,key,regime,FY)` rejected. AC3: Tax slabs require `regime`+`financial_year`; PT slabs require `state`,`slab_min`,`slab_max`. AC4: Versioned & audited (P05); no in-place edit of a row used in a LOCKED run. AC5: PT resolution returns the slab for the snapshotted state; missing mapping → `ERR-PS10-PT-STATE` (422).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: HRA class % by `city_class` (X/Y/Z). BR2: A row used by a locked payslip is immutable. BR3: Effective dates align to the 1st unless mid-month proration enabled. BR4: PT by state of posting, not legal-entity default; inter-state transfer uses destination slab from the transfer date.
- **Data Model References:** `rate_tables` (incl. `state`), `pay_matrix_levels`, `pay_scales` (ref), `arrears` (downstream); P05 audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/rate-tables` | add effective-dated rate (PT requires `state`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/rate-tables?type=PT_SLAB&state=KARNATAKA&date=` | resolve rate as-of |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/pay-matrix` | add matrix level/cell |

- **UI Behaviour:** Effective-dated grid with as-of date + state selector; retrospective warning banner; old-vs-new compare.
- **Edge Cases:** DA notified after lock → arrears next cycle; cell deletion when referenced; mid-month DA; employee with no PT-state mapping; inter-state transfer mid-month.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RateTableController`, `EffectiveDateResolver`, `PayMatrixService`, `PtStateResolver` |
| Backend Flow | Validate range → non-overlap check (incl. state) → persist → if past-dated, enqueue arrears candidate scan (**X.1** `JOB-PS10-ARREAR-SCAN`) |
| Validation | `VAL-EFFECTIVE`, `VAL-PS10-RATE-NONOVERLAP`, `VAL-ENUM`; required fields by table_type; immutability vs locked runs |
| Authorization | P02: SysAdmin write; Payroll Approver approve; Auditor read |
| Failure Handling | Overlap → `ERR-PS10-RATE-OVERLAP` (409); locked-ref edit → `ERR-PS10-RATE-LOCKED` (409); missing PT state → `ERR-PS10-PT-STATE` (422) |
| Dependencies | FR-10, FR-22 (state of posting), **P05**, **X.1** |
| Test Guidance | Resolver boundary dates; retrospective trigger; PT-by-state; inter-state transfer |

### FR-PS10-03 — Employee Salary Structure Assignment & Versioning

- **Module:** PS10-F03
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (maker), Payroll Approver (checker via P01), HR Admin (request)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to assign and version each employee's salary structure so that pay is derived correctly and every change is effective-dated and auditable (P05).
- **Description:** Bind an employee to a `pay_matrix_level` + component set → `employee_salary_structures` + `employee_salary_components`. Each change creates a new version (prior SUPERSEDED). Overrides require a reason. Scheme (GPF vs NPS) auto-attached by DOJ. **Approval is a P01 maker-checker instance.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: New version supersedes prior ACTIVE with contiguous ranges. AC2: A FIXED_OVERRIDE requires `override_amount`+`override_reason`. AC3: Changes route through **P01** maker-checker before ACTIVE. AC4: A change in a LOCKED period → handled as arrear (FR-10).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: One ACTIVE version per employee per date. BR2: City class drives HRA. BR3: Statutory deduction components auto-attached by scheme.
- **Data Model References:** `employee_salary_structures`, `employee_salary_components`, `pay_matrix_levels`, `pay_components`, `deductions`; P05 audit; `workflows` (P01).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/structures` | create new version |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/structures` | version history |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/structures/{id}:approve` | P01 checker approve |

- **UI Behaviour:** Structure builder (auto-resolved components vs overrides); effective-date timeline; version diff; HRA auto-updates on city-class change.
- **Edge Cases:** GPF vs NPS by DOJ cutoff; mid-month transfer changing city class/state; override exceeding sanity bounds.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `StructureController`, `StructureVersionService`, `SchemeResolver` |
| Backend Flow | Build component set from rules + scheme → apply overrides → validate → create version → close prior → **P01 maker-checker** → ACTIVE |
| Authorization | P02: Payroll Officer create; Payroll Approver approve |
| State & Side Effects | new ACTIVE version; SR-relevant pay change emits **PS12** event on finalisation; P05 audit |
| Failure Handling | Locked period → `ERR-PS10-STRUCT-LOCKED` (409); overlap → `ERR-PS10-STRUCT-OVERLAP` (409) |
| Dependencies | FR-01/02, **PS06** (pay-fixation source), FR-10, **P01**, **PS12** |

### FR-PS10-04 — Monthly Payroll Run Engine (single-in-flight, rounding-balanced)

- **Module:** PS10-F04
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (run), Payroll Approver (oversee)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to execute the monthly payroll run that computes every eligible employee's pay deterministically from a frozen cross-module snapshot, with no concurrent conflicting run.
- **Description:** Orchestrates the cycle as an **X.1 job (`JOB-PS10-RUN`)**: freeze inputs at cutoff and take the cross-module snapshot (FR-22), gather structure snapshots + leave/LWP (FR-05) + statutory deductions (FR-06) + loan recoveries (FR-08) + arrears (FR-10) + perquisites (FR-21), evaluate rules in order, append a `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` line, persist `payslips`+`payslip_lines` with full `calc_trace`. Single atomic commit; DRAFT and FINAL modes. A **single-in-flight constraint** (partial unique index + X.1 period lock) prevents two concurrent FINAL runs per cycle.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Draft run → per-employee results + full trace + quarantine list (no partial commit). AC2: Re-run with unchanged inputs + same frozen snapshot → identical results. AC3: Computation errors isolated; run reports them without aborting valid computations. AC4: `net_pay ≥ 0`; un-recovered amounts roll into `deduction_carryforwards`. AC5: Run totals = sum of payslips at commit; rounding-adjustment ties to the rupee. AC6: Second FINAL attempt → `ERR-PS10-RUN-INFLIGHT` (409).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Only ACTIVE employees in the snapshot scope on pay date (joiners/leavers prorated). BR2: FINAL requires INPUT_LOCKED + frozen snapshot. BR3: Rate tables effective on the period, not "today". BR4: Suspended employees → subsistence only (Appendix 16.6); dies-non → no pay/no service. BR5: Mid-month inter-DDO transfer uses DDO-of-record for the transfer month (Appendix 16.8).
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_cycles`, `payroll_runs` (`snapshot_id`, `in_flight_lock_key`, `workflow_instance_id`), `payslips`, `payslip_lines`, `run_input_snapshots`, `employee_salary_structures`, `deductions`, `deduction_carryforwards`, `loans_advances`, `arrears`, `perquisites`, `rate_tables`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/runs` | start a run (mode in body; acquires in-flight lock; `Idempotency-Key` required) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}` | run status & totals |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/exceptions` | per-employee failures (cursor-paginated) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:cancel` | cancel draft (releases lock) |

- **UI Behaviour:** Run console (computed/total progress, live totals, exception drill-down, per-employee trace, snapshot ref+checksum, in-flight lock indicator). FINAL gated behind reconciliation.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-month joiner/leaver proration; suspended (subsistence); dies-non; missing structure; division-by-zero; very large cohort; inter-DDO transfer month; concurrent FINAL.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RunOrchestrator`, `ComputationEngine`, `InputAggregator`, `SnapshotBinder`, `RoundingBalancer`, `StagingRepository`, `InFlightLockManager`; runs as **X.1** job worker |
| Backend Flow | Acquire in-flight lock (X.1 period lock) → lock inputs → bind frozen snapshot → aggregate (incl. perquisite monthly value) → compute in order into staging → append rounding-adjustment → validate identities → atomic commit → roll un-recovered to carryforwards |
| Validation | `VAL-PS10-IDENTITY`, `VAL-CURRENCY`; net≥0; scope eligibility; rate resolution; snapshot present; in-flight uniqueness |
| Authorization | P02: Payroll Officer (own entity/org scope); Approver read |
| State & Side Effects | run QUEUED→RUNNING→COMPLETED/FAILED; cycle OPEN→COMPUTING→COMPUTED; **P05 audit**; **X.2** notifications |
| Failure Handling | Per-employee error → quarantine + `error_summary`; engine fault → FAILED, no commit; concurrent FINAL → `ERR-PS10-RUN-INFLIGHT` (409); idempotent restart (X.1 per-period run key) |
| Dependencies | FR-01..03, 05, 06, 08, 10, 21, 22; **X.1**, **P05**, **X.2** |
| Test Guidance | Determinism vs frozen snapshot; proration; subsistence/dies-non; quarantine isolation; rounding tie-out; in-flight lock; large-batch perf; rollback on mid-commit failure |

### FR-PS10-05 — Attendance & Leave (LWP) Input Integration (subsistence/dies-non)

- **Module:** PS10-F05
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to ingest paid/unpaid day counts and LWP from **PS03** as-of the cutoff snapshot so LOP, subsistence, and dies-non are computed accurately.
- **Description:** Pull approved attendance/leave for the cycle from **PS03** (PrimeSoft M04 Leave + M05 Attendance) **into the run snapshot (FR-22)** by reference. Compute LWP LOP (per-day rate = monthly pay / days-in-month or /30 per policy). Subsistence and dies-non per Appendix 16.6. Inputs freeze at cutoff; late changes route to arrears.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: LWP days reduce pay using the configured per-day basis; reduction shows as a line. AC2: paid+LWP reconcile to calendar days for full-month employees. AC3: Attendance after cutoff excluded (snapshot frozen), queued for arrears. AC4: Unauthorised absence beyond threshold flags an exception (link to PS09 if dies-non). AC5: Suspended → subsistence only; dies-non → zero pay/zero qualifying service.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Per-day basis configurable. BR2: Half-pay leave reduces eligible components per policy. BR3: Joiner/leaver proration uses actual paid days. BR4: Subsistence base/escalation & dies-non per Appendix 16.6.
- **Data Model References:** `payslips` (paid_days/lwp_days), `payslip_lines` (LWP/subsistence line), `run_input_snapshots` (`ps03_facts`), **PS03** attendance (read), `arrears` (late inputs).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/attendance-inputs` | fetched PS03 inputs (from snapshot) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/attendance-inputs:refresh` | re-pull before cutoff |

- **UI Behaviour:** Attendance input grid (employee × paid/LWP/half/subsistence); exceptions highlighted; "refresh from PS03" with cutoff/snapshot lock indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Retrospective leave regularisation post-lock; dies-non vs LWP; overlapping leave records; leave-encashment interplay (FR-12).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `AttendanceInputAdapter` (PS03 client), `LWPCalculator`, `SubsistenceCalculator` |
| Backend Flow | Fetch approved PS03 records for period into snapshot → map to paid/LWP/half/dies-non → compute per-day deduction or subsistence → feed run engine |
| Authorization | P02: Payroll Officer scope |
| Failure Handling | PS03 unavailable → handled via service-contract error mapping → `PRECONDITION_FAILED` (412) / `INTERNAL` (500) + `ERR-LOADFAIL`, retry; mismatch → exception list |
| Dependencies | **PS03**, FR-04, FR-10, FR-22 |
| Test Guidance | Per-day basis variants; proration; post-cutoff handling; subsistence escalation; dies-non path |

### FR-PS10-06 — Statutory Deductions Computation (GPF/PF, NPS, PT-by-state, Pension, Insurance)

- **Module:** PS10-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Approver
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want statutory deductions computed automatically per scheme and slab so GPF/PF, NPS, PT-by-state, pension, and insurance are accurate and remittable, with YTD derived from the immutable line ledger.
- **Description:** Compute GPF/CPF, NPS (employee 10% + employer 14% of basic+DA), PT (state slab resolved by snapshotted state of posting), pension/insurance, court attachments. **YTD = derived Σ over `payslip_lines` (rule #9)**; `cumulative_ytd` is a cache. Feeds the remittance tracker (FR-19).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: NPS computes employee + employer; employer appears as info/cost line feeding the GL journal. AC2: PT applies the correct state slab. AC3: Statutory caps enforced. AC4: YTD recomputes from the ledger and stays correct across regular+arrears+off-cycle and after reopen. AC5: Court-attachment respects CPC s.60 exemption independently of the flat floor (FR-09); shortfall → carryforward.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: GPF/NPS scheme by DOJ. BR2: Court-attachment priority within net-pay protection + own exemption. BR3: Employer NPS/pension are costs, not employee deductions. BR4: PT by state of posting. BR5: Subsistence-only employees compute on the subsistence base.
- **Data Model References:** `deductions` (cache YTD), `payslip_lines` (YTD truth), `rate_tables`, `deduction_carryforwards`, `statutory_remittances` (downstream); P05 audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/deductions` | list deductions + derived YTD |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/deductions` | add voluntary/manual deduction |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/statutory-summary` | run-level statutory totals (feeds FR-19) |

- **UI Behaviour:** Deduction panel per employee (scheme, rate, derived YTD with "recomputed from ledger" provenance); voluntary GPF top-up; employer-contribution info card; PT-state indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year scheme migration; PT slab boundary; inter-state transfer changing PT; court attachment exceeding protected net (carryforward); NPS crossing basic+DA threshold.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `StatutoryDeductionService`, `SchemeResolver`, `SlabResolver` (state-aware), `YtdLedgerDeriver` |
| Backend Flow | Resolve scheme & PT state → compute each statutory line via rate tables → apply caps & priority & CPC exemption → write lines → recompute cache YTD from ledger |
| Failure Handling | Missing rate → run exception `ERR-PS10-RATE-NOTFOUND` (422); missing PT state → `ERR-PS10-PT-STATE` (422); cap breach → clamp + flag |
| Dependencies | FR-02, FR-04, FR-09, FR-19, FR-22 |

### FR-PS10-07 — Income-Tax (TDS) Declarations, Proofs & Full Computation Pipeline

- **Module:** PS10-F07 / PS10-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (declare), Payroll Officer (verify), Payroll Approver
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to declare investments, capture previous-employer income (Form-12B via a W.2 form), choose a regime, upload proofs (PS13), and see a transparent, traceable projected tax — surcharge, cess, rebate, and relief included — so TDS is accurate across the year.
- **Description:** Employees submit `tax_declarations` (regime, 80C/80D/HRA/home-loan, Form-12B), upload proofs (**PS13**). The engine projects annual taxable income — **incl. taxable perquisites from FR-21** — through the full pipeline: gross taxable → standard deduction → Chapter VI-A → slab tax → surcharge (with marginal relief) → 4% cess → 87A rebate → 89(1)/Form-10E relief — spreading TDS across remaining months. Intermediate values persisted on `tax_declarations`. Proof verification is a **P01** maker-checker flow after cutoff; unverified declarations revert to conservative computation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Switching regime recomputes the full pipeline and per-month TDS. AC2: After proof cutoff, unverified declared deductions excluded, TDS recomputed. AC3: Declaration locks after FY proof cutoff. AC4: Projected tax updates when salary/arrears/perquisites change. AC5: Each stage persisted and shown as a step-by-step breakdown. AC6: Mid-year joiners' Form-12B income included. AC7: Cross-FY arrears generate Form-10E relief in TDS and Form-16.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: New regime ignores most exemptions per statute. BR2: `TDS = (projected annual tax − YTD TDS from ledger) / remaining months`. BR3: Proof verification is **P01** maker-checker; partial verification reduces allowed amount. BR4: Surcharge with marginal relief; 4% cess; 87A per regime. BR5: Perquisite value (FR-21) added before slab tax.
- **Data Model References:** `tax_declarations` (12B/10E/surcharge/cess/87A/std-deduction/perquisite_total), `perquisites`, **PS13** documents (proofs), `deductions` (TDS), `payslip_lines` (TDS YTD truth), `rate_tables` (TAX_SLAB).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

### FR-PS10-08 — Loans & Advances Management (concessional-loan perquisite linkage)

- **Module:** PS10-F08
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), DDO/HOD (sanction via P01), Payroll Officer (schedule/recover)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to apply for loans/advances and have installments recovered automatically through payroll, with interest, and any concessional-interest perquisite correctly taxed.
- **Description:** Lifecycle for HBA/vehicle/computer/festival/GPF/salary advances: request → **P01 sanction** → disburse → installment recovery → foreclosure/closure. Maintains `loans_advances`+`loan_repayments`. When charged rate < reference rate, the loan is flagged `is_concessional` and generates a taxable perquisite (FR-21) wired into TDS (FR-07).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Each run recovers the scheduled installment; outstanding decreases. AC2: Final installment closes the loan; `Σ principal = principal`. AC3: Foreclosure computes outstanding + accrued interest in one entry. AC4: Insufficient net → partial/skip per policy; shortfall → `deduction_carryforwards`. AC5: Concessional/interest-free loan auto-creates/updates a `perquisites` row (Rule 3); rate change revises it.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Total deductions cannot push net below the protected minimum; loan recovery yields after statutory. BR2: Interest method fixed at sanction. BR3: A loan on hold skips recovery unless policy charges interest. BR4: Concessional-loan perquisite per Appendix 16.7/Rule 3.
- **Data Model References:** `loans_advances` (`is_concessional`, `perquisite_id`, `workflow_instance_id`), `loan_repayments`, `perquisites`, `payslip_lines`, `deduction_carryforwards`; **P01** sanction; P05 audit.

### FR-PS10-09 — Recoveries & Ad-hoc Adjustments (net-pay floor, attachment exemption, legal-eligibility gate)

- **Module:** PS10-F09
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Approver, DDO (overpayment adjudication), (source) Disciplinary Authority (**PS09**)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to apply recoveries ordered by disciplinary authorities and recover prior overpayments within a defined net-pay floor and statutory exemptions — and only where legally permitted.
- **Description:** Ingest recovery orders from **PS09** and internally-detected overpayments; schedule recovery within a configurable protected net-pay floor and CPC s.60 exemption; track recovered-to-date; roll unmet amounts into `deduction_carryforwards`. Before scheduling an overpayment recovery, flag legally-barred cases (Rafiq Masih line) for explicit DDO/authority decision (via a **P01** flow) with recorded justification.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: A PS09 recovery order creates a scheduled recovery with defined total + per-cycle amount. AC2: Recovery never exceeds ordered total. AC3: Respects the floor + s.60 exemption; spillover → carryforwards. AC4: Recovered-to-date reported; closes when satisfied. AC5: Recovery against a legally-barred case blocked until an authority records a decision (`ERR-PS10-RECOVERY-BARRED`). AC6: Rolled-forward un-recovered deductions appear in a managed backlog (FR-24/§12).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Disciplinary recoveries cannot be waived by Payroll. BR2: Overpayment recovery requires documented justification, legal-eligibility check, and employee notification (X.2). BR3: Priority: statutory → court attachment (s.60) → disciplinary → overpayment → loans → voluntary. BR4: Protected floor configurable (cadre/jurisdiction), distinct from attachment exemption.
- **Data Model References:** `deductions` (RECOVERY; `attachment_exemption_basis`), `deduction_carryforwards`, `payslip_lines`, **PS09** order (read); P05 audit.

### FR-PS10-10 — Arrears & Retrospective Revisions Engine (dependent-allowance cascade)

- **Module:** PS10-F10
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Approver
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want the system to compute arrears for back-dated DA/increment/promotion/pay-fixation so employees receive the exact difference owed, with all dependent allowances recomputed and statutory deductions and Form-10E relief re-derived on the differential.
- **Description:** When a retrospective change occurs (DA revision FR-02, pay-fixation **PS06**, correction), the engine recomputes pay for each affected past month using then-effective rules. A retrospective basic-pay change recomputes every dependent component in order per historical month — DA, HRA, TPT, NPS, GPF. It derives per-component per-month deltas vs actually paid, recomputes statutory deductions (incl. TDS) on the differential, flows arrear TDS delta through the corrected YTD ledger and Form-10E relief, and produces an `arrears` record paid through an ARREARS cycle.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Arrears = Σ over months of (new − old) for basic and every dependent component, net of recomputed deductions. AC2: References the source (notification/PS06 order); month-wise component-wise break-up. AC3: Recompute TDS via the derived YTD ledger; flow into Form-16/10E. AC4: LOCKED-period arrears never mutate the original payslip (additive lines via `arrear_ref`). AC5: Dependent-allowance cascade shown explicitly.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Use rules effective in each historical month. BR2: Negative arrears via recovery/carryforward. BR3: Promotion arrears link to PS06 fixation order. BR4: Cross-FY arrears → Form-10E relief (FR-07).
- **Data Model References:** `arrears` (`component_breakup`), `payslips`/`payslip_lines`, `rate_tables` (historical), `payroll_cycles` (ARREARS), `deductions`, `tax_declarations` (10E).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears/{id}` | arrear breakup (component-wise cascade) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears/{id}:approve` | approve for payout (P01) |

- **UI Behaviour:** Arrears screen with month-wise grid (basic delta + DA/HRA/TPT/NPS/GPF deltas), source reference, net arrear after deduction recompute, 10E relief preview, approve-to-cycle action.
- **Edge Cases:** Overlapping retrospective changes; separation during arrear window (→FnF); arrears crossing FYs (10E); downward revision causing recovery/carryforward.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ArrearsEngine`, `HistoricalRecomputer`, `DependentCascadeResolver`, `RateTableResolver`, `Form10EService` |
| Backend Flow | Identify affected employees/months → recompute each month with historical rules → cascade dependent components → diff vs actual → recompute statutory delta → 10E relief → persist arrear → route to ARREARS cycle |
| Authorization | P02: Payroll Officer compute; Approver approve (P01) |

### FR-PS10-11 — Supplementary & Off-Cycle Payroll

- **Module:** PS10-F11
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, DDO (sanction), Payroll Approver
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to process supplementary and off-cycle payments so missed payments, new-joiner first pay, bonuses, ex-gratia, re-disbursement of held net pay, and urgent corrections are paid outside the regular cycle with the same controls.
- **Description:** Create SUPPLEMENTARY/OFF_CYCLE/BONUS cycles for a defined cohort, compute with the same engine and controls (snapshot, reconciliation, **P01** approval, DSC-signed bank file over X.3), feed the same derived YTD ledger. Off-cycle requires **P01 sanction**. Off-cycle clears `disbursement_holds` once accounts are corrected.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Off-cycle for a cohort computes/reconciles/approves/disburses independently. AC2: Off-cycle contributes to derived YTD. AC3: Off-cycle requires DDO sanction + Approver approval (SoD via P01/P02). AC4: Duplicate off-cycle for same purpose/employee prevented (`Idempotency-Key`). AC5: Re-disbursing a held amount references the originating `disbursement_holds` row and closes it on success.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Bonus/ex-gratia taxability per rules. BR2: Off-cycle cannot pay a component already paid for the period unless flagged correction. BR3: Same reconciliation/locking gates. BR4: Single-in-flight per off-cycle cycle.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_cycles` (OFF_CYCLE/SUPPLEMENTARY), `payroll_runs`, `payslips`, `bank_disbursements`, `disbursement_holds`, `deductions`.

### FR-PS10-12 — Benefits Administration (Medical, LTC/LTA, Gratuity, Insurance, Reimbursements, Leave Encashment)

- **Module:** PS10-F12
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (claim), Reporting Manager (recommend via P01), Payroll Officer/Approver (verify/pay)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to enrol in and claim benefits (medical, LTC/LTA, reimbursements, leave encashment) and have gratuity/insurance administered so I receive entitlements correctly and they reflect in pay, FnF, or off-cycle payout.
- **Description:** Manage `benefits` and `benefit_claims` (incl. `LEAVE_ENCASHMENT`) with **P01** workflow approval; accrue gratuity per period via **X.1 `JOB-PS10-GRATUITY-ACCRUAL`**; administer group insurance and reimbursement plans. Leave encashment = `eligible balance × per-day basis (basic+DA/30 or policy)`, subject to caps and taxability; can feed regular pay, FnF (FR-20), or off-cycle. LTC respects block-year rules.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Claim follows submit → recommend → approve (P01) → pay; approved ≤ entitlement/cap. AC2: LTC validates block-year eligibility/prior utilisation. AC3: Gratuity accrues per period using last-drawn basic+DA + years of service, capped at statutory ceiling. AC4: Approved reimbursements appear on payslip (taxable per rules) or off-cycle. AC5: Leave encashment computes from eligible balance × per-day basis with cap and taxability; retirement-exempt portion (s.10(10AA)) excluded from taxable income.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Medical/LTC taxability per statute. BR2: Gratuity payout settled by PS11/FnF at separation; PS10 maintains accrual. BR3: Claims require proofs (PS13); duplicate proof reuse blocked. BR4: Leave-encashment eligibility/caps configurable; retirement exemption applied; in-service encashment taxable.
- **Data Model References:** `benefits` (incl. LEAVE_ENCASHMENT), `benefit_claims`, `gratuity_accruals`, **PS13** documents, `payslip_lines`/off-cycle, `fnf_settlements` (encashment feed); **P01** workflow.

### FR-PS10-13 — Payslip Generation, Self-Service Access & Reopen Versioning

- **Module:** PS10-F13
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate/publish), Employee (view)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to view and download my monthly payslip with a full break-up; and as Payroll I want to publish payslips securely once the run is locked, with clear versioning when a period is reopened.
- **Description:** Render `payslips` into a PDF stored in **PS13**, with employer/employee details, component break-up, derived YTD, leave/LWP, loan/recovery status, perquisite and tax summary. Published only after run lock; immutable thereafter. On reopen (FR-16) the original becomes SUPERSEDED/REVERSED and a new version is published; employees see version history with the active version highlighted. Publication notifications via **X.2**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Payslip totals match `payslips`/`payslip_lines` exactly (incl. rounding-adjustment). AC2: Publish only when run LOCKED. AC3: Employees see only their own (P02); managers see direct reports per scope. AC4: A published payslip is immutable; a correction → new version (reopen) or additive arrear/supplementary, prior version SUPERSEDED. AC5: Viewer shows version number + "what changed" summary.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Bank account/PAN masked by default (P02 ceiling). BR2: Includes derived YTD + tax-projection summary. BR3: Download access logged (`security_audit_log`). BR4: Superseded versions remain accessible read-only.
- **Data Model References:** `payslips` (`version`, `superseded_by_payslip_id`), `payslip_lines`, **PS13** documents (PDF); P05 audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/payslips:publish` | publish (post-lock) |

| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/payslips/{id}/document` | download PDF (PS13) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/payslips/{id}/versions` | version history + diff |

- **UI Behaviour:** Payslip viewer (collapsible earnings/deductions, YTD tab, download); version selector with active-version badge + lock-to-lock diff; manager view scoped to reports; "provisional/final/superseded" badge.
- **Edge Cases:** Re-publish after arrears (additive) vs reopen (versioned); separated employee needing historical payslips; large-batch PDF generation (X.1).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `PayslipRenderer`, `DocumentClient` (PS13), `PayslipController`, `VersionDiffService` |
| Backend Flow | On publish, validate run LOCKED → render PDF per version → store in PS13 → status PUBLISHED → **X.2** notify; on reopen, supersede prior, render new version, persist diff |

### FR-PS10-14 — Bank Disbursement: DSC-Signed File, Positive-Pay Guard & Suspense-Hold Reconciliation

- **Module:** PS10-F14
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate), **Payroll Disburser** (DSC-sign/transmit), Finance/Treasury (positive-pay confirm)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Disburser, I want to generate, validate, DSC-sign, and transmit the bank disbursement file with a unique bank-side batch reference over **X.3**, and reconcile acknowledgements and the treasury debit (positive pay) so net pay reaches every account exactly once, no payment is duplicated on resend, and no net pay leaves the tie-out silently.
- **Description:** Produce a `bank_disbursements` file (single treasury-certified format; ISO20022/CUSTOM deferred) from a LOCKED run's net pay. Excluded/invalid-account net parked in `disbursement_holds`, preserving `Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net`. The file carries a bank-side unique `bank_batch_ref` and is DSC/HSM-signed (keys in HSM, never in DB; integration creds in **P04**). Transmission and ack handling run on the **X.3 integration framework** (idempotent outbound calls, circuit-breaking, payload versioning, per-integration error mapping). A timeout/ambiguous ack moves the batch to `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`; **resend is forbidden until a mandatory positive-pay/treasury-debit reconciliation confirms the credits did NOT post.** Failed lines route to off-cycle re-disbursement (FR-11) via their hold rows.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: `Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net_total`; `record_count` = payees with net>0 and a valid account. AC2: File generation requires a LOCKED, reconciled run. AC3: DSC-signing by the **Payroll Disburser** ≠ run creator ≠ approver (SoD via P02); signature verified on transmit and on ack. AC4: Ack reconciliation marks each line success/failed; failures → `disbursement_holds`. AC5: On gateway timeout the batch → `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`; resend blocked until positive-pay confirms non-debit; resend then issues a NEW `bank_batch_ref`. AC6: Held net pay is an owned, aged backlog (FR-24/§12), cleared only via off-cycle.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Invalid/missing/frozen accounts → `disbursement_holds`, never silently removed. BR2: A file transmitted once per `bank_batch_ref`; re-transmission requires a new batch + reason + confirmed non-debit. BR3: DSC/HSM signature = authenticity/non-repudiation; checksum = integrity only. BR4: No resend without positive-pay confirmation by a principal ≠ transmitter.
- **Data Model References:** `bank_disbursements` (`bank_batch_ref`, `dsc_signature`, `signing_cert_ref`, positive-pay fields, status incl. `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`), `disbursement_holds`, `payslips` (net), **PS13** documents (file); **X.3**/**P04**; P05 audit.

### FR-PS10-15 — Payroll Register & Reconciliation (disbursed + held + failed = net)

- **Module:** PS10-F15
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Approver (sign-off)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Approver, I want a payroll register with control totals and variance analysis — including the disbursed/held/failed split — so I can reconcile the run before approval, with no money unaccounted.
- **Description:** Generate the register and `payroll_reconciliations` with gross/deduction/net control totals, prior-period comparison, variance %, the disbursement tie-out, and an exceptions list (joiners, leavers, large swings, negative nets, quarantined employees, held suspense, overdue remittances). Sign-off is the gate before approval (FR-16).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Control totals = run totals = sum of payslips (three-way, incl. rounding-adjustment). AC2: Variance vs prior period with drill-down. AC3: A run cannot be approved until reconciliation SIGNED_OFF. AC4: All exceptions listed and individually explainable. AC5: The disbursement tie-out displayed and must balance before disbursement is marked complete.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Variance beyond a configurable threshold requires explanation before sign-off. BR2: Quarantined employees (FR-04) appear as exceptions and block sign-off. BR3: Sign-off by a checker ≠ run creator (P02). BR4: Held suspense + overdue remittances surface as managed exceptions.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_reconciliations`, `payroll_runs`, `payslips`, `disbursement_holds`, `statutory_remittances`; P05 audit.

### FR-PS10-16 — Payroll Approval, Finalisation, Locking & Reopen-Versioning

- **Module:** PS10-F16
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Approver / Controller
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Approver, I want to approve and lock a reconciled payroll run so results become immutable, payslips can publish, and disbursement can proceed — with a controlled, justified, versioned reopen path only when essential.
- **Description:** Multi-level approval on **P01** moves a reconciled run to APPROVED then LOCKED. Locking freezes payslips/lines (`is_immutable=true`) and the cycle (LOCKED). A reopen requires Approver authority + justification, supersedes originals (REVERSED/SUPERSEDED), creates a new payslip version and successor run, persists a structured lock-to-lock diff in the **P05 `audit_log`**, and recomputes derived YTD from surviving versions. Reopen disabled once disbursement transmitted. Single-in-flight prevents a reopen successor colliding with another run.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Approval requires SIGNED_OFF reconciliation; approver ≠ run creator (P01/P02 SoD). AC2: Locking sets child payslips immutable and the cycle LOCKED. AC3: No write to any locked payslip/line succeeds after lock. AC4: Reopen requires justification, supersedes originals, creates a new version + successor run, records a lock-to-lock diff, recomputes YTD, and is blocked post-transmission. AC5: A reopen/successor cannot start while another FINAL run is in flight (`ERR-PS10-RUN-INFLIGHT`).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Maker-checker enforced at approval (P01). BR2: Locked runs are the system of record. BR3: Post-disbursement corrections only via arrears/supplementary/off-cycle. BR4: Reopen versioning preserves the original immutable payslip.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_runs` (`superseded_run_id`, `in_flight_lock_key`, `workflow_instance_id`), `payroll_cycles`, `payslips` (`version`, `superseded_by_payslip_id`), `payroll_reconciliations`; **P01** workflow; **P05** audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:approve` | approve (P01 checker) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:lock` | finalise & lock |

| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/lock-diff?vs={priorRunId}` | lock-to-lock diff |

- **UI Behaviour:** Approval screen (reconciliation summary, approve/lock gated by role + SoD), reopen dialog requiring justification and showing impending supersession, lock status badge, lock-to-lock diff viewer.
- **Edge Cases:** Lock without reconciliation; reopen after transmission; concurrent approval attempts (optimistic locking); reopen colliding with in-flight run.

### FR-PS10-17 — Statutory Outputs: Form-16 (Part A from MATCHED deposits), Form-24Q & Schedules

- **Module:** PS10-F17
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate), Payroll Approver (certify)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to generate Form-16, Form-24Q, and PT/GPF/NPS remittance schedules so the organisation meets filing and remittance obligations accurately — with Form-16 Part A derived from actually-deposited-and-matched TDS.
- **Description:** Aggregate derived YTD earnings/deductions/TDS to produce Form-16 (Part A/B), Form-24Q, and remittance schedules. Form-16 Part A reconciles to `statutory_remittances` in MATCHED status, making the deadline guarantee (G2) provable. Part B reflects the full TDS pipeline (FR-07). Schedules feed FR-19. Outputs reconciled against registers and the line ledger, stored in **PS13**; portal formats exchanged over **X.3** (TRACES/CRA).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Form-16 TDS totals tie to Σ TDS `payslip_lines` for the FY (incl. arrears) and to MATCHED `statutory_remittances` for Part A. AC2: Form-24Q quarterly totals reconcile to monthly TDS in the quarter. AC3: Remittance schedules list per-scheme amounts with split and feed FR-19. AC4: Outputs certified (P01 maker-checker) before release and stored/versioned. AC5: Part A flags TDS deducted but not yet MATCHED, preventing premature certification.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Section 89(1) relief (Form-10E, FR-07) reflected for cross-FY arrears. BR2: PAN mandatory (`VAL-PAN`); missing PAN flagged. BR3: Remittance deadlines tracked with reminders (X.2) via FR-19. BR4: Part A derives from deposited/MATCHED amounts only.
- **Data Model References:** `payslip_lines` (YTD truth), `statutory_remittances` (MATCHED), `tax_declarations` (10E), `deductions` (cache), **PS13** documents; P05 audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/statutory/form16:generate` | generate Form-16 (FY); Part A from MATCHED |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/statutory/form24q:generate` | quarterly TDS return |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/statutory/remittances?scheme=PT&period=` | remittance schedule (feeds FR-19) |

- **UI Behaviour:** Statutory output center (select FY/quarter, generate, reconcile-status indicator deducted vs deposited/MATCHED, certify & release, employee Form-16 self-service download).
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year joiner/leaver Form-16 (incl. Form-12B); revised return after correction/reopen; missing PAN; cross-FY arrears relief; TDS deducted but deposit pending.

### FR-PS10-18 — Parallel / What-If Run & Cost-to-Organisation Analytics

- **Module:** PS10-F04 / PS10-F18
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Approver, Department Head, Finance
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Approver, I want to run what-if/parallel scenarios and view cost-to-organisation analytics so I can model the impact of DA revisions, increments, or restructuring — with the comparison exportable to a board paper.
- **Description:** Execute PARALLEL_WHATIF runs against proposed parameters without affecting live data, producing comparison reports vs the actual run. Provide cost analytics (total payroll cost, headcount cost, component-/org-wise breakdown, period trends, employer-contribution costs). The comparison is a structured, exportable board-ready artefact (CSV/PDF). Analytics feed **PS14** dashboards.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: A what-if run never writes live payslips/disbursements; results labelled scenario data. AC2: Comparison shows delta (scenario vs actual) by component/org, exportable as board paper. AC3: Cost analytics aggregate gross/deductions/net/employer cost by org/cadre/component/period. AC4: Analytics respect row-level org scope per role (P02).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Scenario runs retained for audit and labelled. BR2: Employer contributions + gratuity accrual included in true cost-to-org. BR3: Analytics read locked runs for actuals; scenarios for projections. BR4: What-if runs do not acquire the FINAL in-flight lock and never block live runs.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_runs` (PARALLEL_WHATIF, segregated), `payslips` (scenario), aggregates over `payslip_lines`, `gratuity_accruals`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/runs` (run_mode=PARALLEL_WHATIF) | scenario run |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/comparison?vs={actualRunId}` | scenario vs actual (exportable) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/analytics/cost-to-org?groupBy=org_unit,component&period=` | cost analytics |

- **UI Behaviour:** Scenario builder (parameter overrides); comparison view with delta highlighting + "export board paper"; analytics dashboard with drill-down + export; scope-aware filters.
- **Edge Cases:** Scenario over a very large cohort; comparing across structure versions; analytics across cycles with arrears.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | reuse `ComputationEngine` in scenario mode, `ComparisonService`, `CostAnalyticsService`, `BoardPaperExporter` |
| Backend Flow | Run engine with override params into segregated scenario store → compute deltas vs actual → render exportable comparison → aggregate cost analytics from locked runs |
| Authorization | P02: Approver/Dept Head/Finance; org scope |
| Failure Handling | Accidental live write prevented by mode guard; large query → async export (X.1) |
| Dependencies | FR-04, FR-16, **PS14** |

### FR-PS10-19 — Statutory Remittance & Liability Tracking + GL Cost-Journal Posting

- **Module:** PS10-F21
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (capture challan), Payroll Approver (certify/match), Finance (confirm deposit & GL ack)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Approver, I want every statutory deduction tracked from accrued → deposited → matched (with challan/CIN, deadline, late-interest), and the payroll cost-journal exported with a posting status, so the organisation can *prove* it remitted to the State on time and booked the cost.
- **Description:** Closes the deducted → deposited → matched loop. For each scheme/period a `statutory_remittances` row accrues the derived liability (from the line ledger), is scheduled against `statutory_due_date`, captures actual `challan_no`/`cin`/`deposit_date`/`deposited_amount`, computes late-deposit interest u/s 201(1A)/234E when late, and reaches MATCHED when the deposit ties (within tolerance). Separately, a `gl_journals` cost-journal export object is produced per run, exported to Finance ERP over **X.3**, and tracked through `POSTED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED` (PS10 does not own the GL). Deadline reminders via **X.1 `JOB-PS10-REMIT-DEADLINE`** + **X.2**. Satisfies G2 and underpins Form-16 Part A (FR-17).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: A remittance row per scheme/period with `deducted_total = Σ payslip_lines` (rule #14). AC2: Capturing challan/CIN/deposit → DEPOSITED; matching within tolerance → MATCHED. AC3: Past due without deposit → OVERDUE; late interest computed automatically. AC4: Form-16 Part A (FR-17) derives only from MATCHED. AC5: A `gl_journals` row balances (`total_debit = total_credit`) and tracks `POSTED`/`ACKNOWLEDGED`; net-pay clearing line = `Σ disbursed + Σ held` (rule #15). AC6: Overdue/short-payments surface in §12 backlog reporting.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Remittance amounts derive from the immutable ledger. BR2: Documented CRA/GPF rounding tolerance (Appendix 16.2). BR3: Late-interest formula configurable per scheme/section. BR4: PS10 tracks GL posting status only; Finance ERP is the book of record.
- **Data Model References:** `statutory_remittances`, `gl_journals`, `payslip_lines` (derivation), **PS13** documents (challan scans), **X.2** notifications; **X.3** ERP/portal; P05 audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/gl-journals/{id}:acknowledge` | Finance posting acknowledgement |

- **UI Behaviour:** Remittance ledger (per-scheme/period cards accrued→scheduled→deposited→matched, deadline countdown, late-interest indicator, challan capture with PS13 upload); GL journal viewer (balanced debit/credit, posting-status badge).
- **Edge Cases:** Partial deposit (SHORT_PAID); deposit after deadline (late interest); challan correction; reopen changing derived liability after deposit; GL rejected by ERP.

### FR-PS10-20 — Full-and-Final Settlement (FnF)

- **Module:** PS10-F22
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin (initiate), Payroll Officer (compute), DDO (sanction), Payroll Approver (approve), Finance (pay)
- **User Story:** As HR/Payroll, I want a single consolidated full-and-final settlement for every separating employee so final-month pay, leave encashment, gratuity, notice-pay recovery, unrecovered loans, carryforwards, and a final TDS true-up net into one last payment (or recovery).
- **Description:** On separation, an FnF run (`payroll_cycles.run_type=FNF`) computes a `fnf_settlements` record netting final-month pay (prorated to LWD), leave encashment (FR-12, retirement exemption), gratuity (settled/handed off to **PS11**), notice-pay recovery, unrecovered loan principal+interest (FR-08), open `deduction_carryforwards`, and a final-year TDS true-up (FR-07) into `net_settlement` (may be negative → recovery). Its own reconciliation and SoD (P01/P02); hands off pension/terminal-benefit data to **PS11**; emits the separation pay event to **PS12**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: A single `fnf_settlements` record consolidating all dues/recoveries. AC2: `net_settlement = final_month_pay + leave_encashment + gratuity − notice_pay_recovery − loan_settlement − other_recoveries − final_tds` and ties to its own reconciliation. AC3: FnF requires DDO sanction + Approver approval (P01; approver ≠ creator). AC4: Open carryforwards and unrecovered loans pulled in; negative net → RECOVERY_PENDING, not a silent write-off. AC5: Gratuity settled or handed off to PS11 with a reference; last-pay-drawn + contribution history supplied to PS11. AC6: Final TDS true-up reflects full-year income incl. perquisites and 89(1) relief.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Same immutability/locking/SoD as a regular run. BR2: Death cases route gratuity/dues per nominee rules (PS11). BR3: Leave-encashment retirement exemption (s.10(10AA)). BR4: No employee record fully closed with an open FnF in RECOVERY_PENDING.
- **Data Model References:** `fnf_settlements`, `payroll_cycles` (FNF), `payslips`/`payslip_lines`, `loans_advances`, `deduction_carryforwards`, `benefit_claims` (encashment), `gratuity_accruals`, `payroll_reconciliations`, `service_register_events` (**PS12**); **P01** workflow; P05 audit. `VAL-FNF`/`VAL-SEP` apply.

| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/fnf/{id}:approve` | Approver approve (≠ creator, P01) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/fnf/{id}` | settlement breakdown |

- **UI Behaviour:** FnF workbench (single screen netting all components to one figure; sanction/approve P01 workflow; PS11 handoff panel; positive-payable vs recovery-pending state).
- **Edge Cases:** Death-in-service (nominee, gratuity exemption); negative net (recovery from terminal benefits via PS11); separation mid-arrear-window; outstanding court attachment at exit; dismissal forfeiting benefits.
- **LLD:**

### FR-PS10-21 — Taxable Perquisite Valuation (Rule 3)

- **Module:** PS10-F20
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (value), Payroll Approver (approve), Employee (view)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want taxable perquisites valued per Rule 3 — especially the concessional/interest-free loan perquisite the system creates via FR-08, and employer-provided accommodation — so TDS is not systematically under-deducted.
- **Description:** Compute and maintain `perquisites` per employee per FY for concessional/interest-free loans (reducing-balance × (reference rate − charged rate)), rent-free/concessional accommodation (license-fee method), motor car, and others. Each perquisite's `taxable_value` (+ `monthly_value`) is wired into FR-07 taxable income via a `PERQUISITE` category component.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: A concessional/interest-free loan (FR-08 `is_concessional=true`) auto-produces an ACTIVE `perquisites` row valued per Rule 3. AC2: Employer accommodation valued by license-fee method. AC3: Each `taxable_value` flows into `tax_declarations.perquisite_total` (rule #17). AC4: A change in loan balance/rate or accommodation status revises the perquisite (REVISED) and re-projects TDS. AC5: Perquisite appears on payslip/tax summary as a non-cash taxable item.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Reference rate configurable, effective-dated. BR2: Perquisite is taxable income, not a cash earning — increases TDS, not net pay. BR3: Every `is_concessional` loan must have a linked perquisite (enforced).
- **Data Model References:** `perquisites`, `loans_advances` (`is_concessional`, `perquisite_id`), `tax_declarations` (`perquisite_total`), `pay_components` (PERQUISITE), `payslip_lines`, `rate_tables` (reference rate).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/perquisites` | create/value a perquisite |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/perquisites?fy=` | list per FY |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/perquisites/{id}:revise` | revise on basis change |

- **UI Behaviour:** Perquisite panel (type, valuation method, computed basis, taxable value, monthly spread, link to source loan/accommodation, "non-cash taxable" badge).
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year loan foreclosure (perquisite stops); reference-rate revision; accommodation surrendered mid-year; multiple concurrent perquisites.

### FR-PS10-22 — Cross-Module Point-in-Time Snapshot Contract

- **Module:** PS10-F19
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (run), Payroll Approver (oversee), System (X.1 automated)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Approver, I want every run to compute against a frozen, as-of snapshot of upstream facts (PS01 employee/bank/PAN/scheme, PS03 attendance, PS06 fixation, PS09 recovery, org unit) so determinism extends upstream and there is no ambiguity about *who* gets paid *how much* into *which account*.
- **Description:** Defines the snapshot-as-of contract. At cutoff, an **X.1 job (`JOB-PS10-SNAPSHOT-FREEZE`)** captures an immutable `run_input_snapshots` row with as-of values of all upstream facts (consumed **by reference** from PS01/PS03/PS06/PS09/org) and a `checksum`; the run computes only from the snapshot. Orders arriving after cutoff but before lock are deferred (recorded in `post_cutoff_deferrals`) to the next cycle/arrears. The snapshot also resolves the bank account paid (snapshotted account even if PS01 changes before disbursement) and the DDO-of-record for mid-month inter-DDO transfers (Appendix 16.8).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Starting a FINAL run freezes a `run_input_snapshots` row (`is_frozen=true`) with a checksum; the run binds to it. AC2: Re-running against the same frozen snapshot reproduces identical payslips (rule #16). AC3: Bank account, PAN, scheme, org unit used are the snapshotted values; a later PS01 change does not alter the locked run or its disbursement account. AC4: A PS06 fixation or PS09 recovery order effective ≤ cutoff is included; one after cutoff is recorded in `post_cutoff_deferrals` and applied to the next cycle/arrears. AC5: For a mid-month inter-DDO transfer, the DDO-of-record rule determines payer + control-account attribution.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Snapshot is append-only and immutable once frozen. BR2: What-if runs may take a non-frozen snapshot copy. BR3: Determinism = pure function of (structure version, effective rates, PS10 inputs, prior ledger, frozen snapshot). BR4: Post-cutoff orders never silently dropped or applied.
- **Data Model References:** `run_input_snapshots`, `payroll_runs` (`snapshot_id`), `payslips` (`snapshot_id`), PS01/PS03/PS06/PS09/org (read by reference); P05 audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/snapshot:freeze` | capture & freeze the as-of snapshot |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/snapshots/{id}` | snapshot facts & checksum |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/snapshots/{id}/deferrals` | post-cutoff deferred orders |

- **UI Behaviour:** Snapshot panel on the run console (as-of timestamp, checksum, per-source counts, post-cutoff deferral list with "carry to next cycle" confirmation).
- **Edge Cases:** Bank account changed in PS01 after cutoff (snapshot account paid); fixation order arriving post-cutoff; inter-DDO transfer on cutoff day; PS03 regularisation after snapshot.
- **LLD:**

### FR-PS10-23 — Service Register (SR) Event Posting Contract *(deferred build / Phase-2)*

- **Module:** PS10 cross-cutting SR write-port (consumed by FR-PS10-03/10/16/20). **Build status: DEFERRED — Phase-2.** The *contract* is authored now (per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §D1/§D2; R1 findings F-02/F-09/F-14) so the PS10→PS12 interface is fully specified — not "effectively unspecified" — even though PS10 builds after the (frozen) PS12 SR ingestion contract and the Phase-2 payroll substrate (M06/M07) are live.
- **Primary Role(s):** System (PS10 run/lock pipeline, automated); Payroll Approver (the run lock / arrear approval is the posting trigger). No interactive UI actor — posting is a side-effect of finalisation, never hand-keyed.
- **User Story:** As the enterprise, I want every pay-establishment event PS10 finalises (pay fixation, annual increment, increment withholding, pay protection) posted exactly once to the canonical PS12 Service Register through its single write-port, with a semantic `fact_key` that prevents the same real-world fact being double-counted for qualifying service, so each employee's service record is complete, non-duplicated, and reversible.
- **Description:** On finalisation/lock of the relevant run (FR-PS10-16) or arrear approval (FR-PS10-10), PS10 posts each qualifying pay event to the **canonical PS12 write-port `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** — the **only** ledger write path (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §D1). PS10 **never** writes `service_register_events` directly and **never** uses `/api/v1/sr/events`. A module-local façade (`POST /api/v1/payroll/sr:post`) is permitted only as an internal relay that **forwards to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`**. Reversals/corrections (a reopened or superseded run, FR-PS10-16) post through `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal` using PS12's `is_reversal=true` + `reverses_source_reference_id` envelope and the published `*_REVERSAL` partner type; PS12 auto-spawns the corrigendum (supersede-only — never delete/edit). **The pay-fixation SR event is PS10's, not PS06's** — PS06 posts the *establishment* event, PS10 posts the *pay* event; no double-claim (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §D2). The ledger is a **net-new PS12 enterprise ledger on the P05 substrate, not a platform primitive.**
- **Event types (cite PS12's published `event_type_code` verbatim; `source_module="PS10"`):**

| `event_type_code` | Emitted when | Qualifying-service-bearing → `fact_key` required |
|---|---|---|
| `PAY_FIXATION` | pay fixed/re-fixed on a PS06 order (FR-PS10-03/10) | yes |
| `ANNUAL_INCREMENT` | annual increment granted (FR-PS10-03/16) | yes |
| `INCREMENT_WITHHELD` | increment withheld (penalty / efficiency-bar; PS09-linked) | yes |
| `PAY_PROTECTION` | pay protected on transfer / re-appointment | yes |

- **Ingest payload contract (per PS12 FR-01):**
  - **Dedup tuple (mandatory on every ingest call):** `(source_module, source_reference_id, source_event_version)` with explicit **`source_module="PS10"`** (not inferred). `source_reference_id` is the PS10 originating-record key (`payslip_id` / `arrear_id` / `run_id`); `source_event_version` increments on supersession. No legacy `source_event_id`.
  - **`fact_key` (mandatory):** every event type above is qualifying-service-bearing, so PS10 **derives and sends `fact_key`** per the type's `fact_correlation_rule` (PS12 FR-01). Missing → PS12 rejects with `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED`.
  - **Scoping:** explicit required **`tenant_id`** and **`entity_id`** on the payload (PS12 hashes `tenant_id`+`employee_id` into `entry_hash`).
  - **Provenance/validation:** `source_module="PS10"` is validated against the type's `allowed_source_modules`; the HTTP `Idempotency-Key` header may be a writer-local hash, but the persisted dedup tuple is the contract.
  - **Reversal:** `is_reversal=true` + `reverses_source_reference_id` + published `*_REVERSAL` partner type via `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Locking a run that fixes/changes pay posts one of `PAY_FIXATION`/`ANNUAL_INCREMENT`/`INCREMENT_WITHHELD`/`PAY_PROTECTION` per affected employee to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` — never to `/api/v1/sr/events`, never a direct table INSERT. AC2: Every posted event carries the full dedup tuple with `source_module="PS10"` and a derived `fact_key`; a payload missing `fact_key` is rejected `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED` and surfaces as a run-post failure (not silently dropped). AC3: Re-posting the same `(source_module, source_reference_id, source_event_version)` is idempotent (PS12 dedup) — no duplicate ledger row, no double-counted qualifying service. AC4: Reopening/superseding a run posts a reversal via `/sr/ingest/reversal` with `is_reversal=true` + `reverses_source_reference_id`; the original is superseded, never edited/deleted. AC5: `tenant_id` and `entity_id` are present and validated; an unscoped post is rejected. AC6 (deferred-build gate): until PS10 is built, the PS10→SR edge is "contracted, not-yet-implemented" and PS12 lists `PS10` in `allowed_source_modules` for all four codes.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` (+ `/reversal`) is the sole write path; any module-local endpoint is a relay only. BR2: One SR post per real-world pay fact, de-duplicated by tuple + `fact_key`. BR3: Supersede-only — corrections are reversal+repost, never in-place edit. BR4: Posting is a side-effect of finalisation/lock (FR-PS10-16) or arrear approval (FR-PS10-10); a failed post blocks the run's "SR-posted" completion and retries on X.3 backoff (no direct-write fallback). BR5: Pay-fixation event ownership is PS10's; the establishment event is PS06's — no double-claim.
- **Data Model References:** `service_register_events` (**PS12-owned — net-new PS12 enterprise ledger on the P05 substrate, not a platform primitive**; referenced, never written directly); PS10 source records `payslips`/`arrears`/`payroll_runs` (supply `source_reference_id`/`source_event_version`); `run_input_snapshots` (supplies the as-of facts behind `fact_key`); P05 audit.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/sr/ingest` | **canonical PS12 write-port** — post a pay event (dedup tuple + `fact_key` + `tenant_id`/`entity_id` + `source_module="PS10"`) |
| POST | `/api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal` | post a reversal (`is_reversal=true` + `reverses_source_reference_id` + `*_REVERSAL` type) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/sr:post` | *(optional internal façade)* relays to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`; no direct ledger write |

- **UI Behaviour:** None (system side-effect). The run console surfaces SR-post status (POSTED / FAILED-RETRYING / REJECTED `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED`) per the canonical UI-state standard; no operator hand-keys SR rows.
- **Edge Cases:** missing `fact_key` → `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED` (block, surface, retry after derivation); duplicate-tuple replay → idempotent no-op; reopened run → reversal + repost at new `source_event_version`; PS12 unavailable at lock → X.3 mapping → `INTERNAL` (500)/`PRECONDITION_FAILED` (412) + backoff retry (never a direct-INSERT fallback); a pay-fixation that is also a PS06 establishment event → PS10 posts only the pay event.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SrEventPoster` (PS12 `/sr/ingest` client over X.3), `FactKeyDeriver` (applies the type's `fact_correlation_rule`), `DedupTupleBuilder` (`source_module="PS10"`, `source_reference_id`, `source_event_version`), `SrReversalPoster` |
| Backend Flow | run lock / arrear approval → build event(s) → derive `fact_key` → assemble dedup tuple + `tenant_id`/`entity_id` → `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` (with `Idempotency-Key`) → on supersession `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal` |
| Authorization | P02: only the PS10 system identity posts; no interactive grant; SoD unaffected (posting follows an already-SoD-gated lock) |
| Failure Handling | missing `fact_key` → `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED`; PS12 down → X.3 circuit-break + backoff, no direct write; never `/api/v1/sr/events` |
| Dependencies | **PS12** (write-port, event catalog, `fact_correlation_rule`, `allowed_source_modules`), FR-PS10-16, FR-PS10-10, FR-PS10-03, **X.3**, **P05**. **Build: DEFERRED / Phase-2.** |
| Test Guidance | write-port-only (assert no `/sr/events`, no direct INSERT); dedup tuple + `source_module="PS10"` present; `fact_key` present for all four codes (allowlist test — R1 F-02); idempotent replay; reversal envelope; tenant/entity required |

## 7. UI Requirements

Screens consume the platform **canonical UI-state standard** (empty / loading / error / no-permission / partial-data; masked fields per RBAC; `E·AR` request-change pattern — Foundation §3). Data-collection screens are **W.2 forms** binding `VAL-*` ids; approval screens surface **P01** task state.

| Screen | Primary role | Key elements | States covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payroll Run Console | Payroll Officer/Approver | progress, live totals, exceptions, trace viewer, snapshot ref+checksum, in-flight lock, run/cancel | empty, computing, completed, failed, quarantine, locked-conflict |
| Reconciliation Dashboard | Payroll Approver | three-way tie-out, disbursed/held/failed tie-out, variance waterfall, exceptions, sign-off | pending, signed-off, mismatch |
| Approval & Lock | Payroll Approver | recon summary, approve/lock (P01), reopen-with-versioning + lock-to-lock diff | reconciled, approved, locked, reopen-blocked |
| Salary Structure Builder | Payroll Officer | components vs overrides, effective timeline, version diff | draft, pending, active, superseded |
| Rule/Component Config | Org/SysAdmin | rule editor w/ live validation, test panel, version timeline, DSL-grammar badge | draft, active, retired, invalid |
| Rate Tables | Org/SysAdmin | effective-dated grid, as-of + state selector, retrospective warning | current, future, retrospective |
| Tax Declaration (self) | Employee | regime wizard, declaration form, Form-12B, step-by-step tax breakdown, proof upload | draft, submitted, verified, rejected, locked |
| Perquisite Panel | Payroll/Employee | type, valuation basis, taxable value, monthly spread, source link | draft, active, revised, closed |
| Loans & Advances | Employee/DDO | application wizard, amortization, statement, foreclosure, concessional-perquisite preview | requested, sanctioned, recovering, closed |
| Benefits & Claims | Employee/Mgr | entitlements, claim form, proof upload, gratuity accrual, leave-encashment calculator | eligible, submitted, approved, paid, rejected |
| Payslip Viewer (self) | Employee | earnings/deductions break-up, YTD, download, version selector + diff | provisional, published, superseded, none |
| Bank Disbursement Console | Payroll Disburser/Finance | validation, suspense-hold list, disbursed/held/failed cards, DSC-sign, SUSPECTED_PROCESSED + positive-pay confirm, ack grid | draft, signed, transmitted, suspected-processed, partial-ack, failed |
| Statutory Output Center | Payroll Officer/Approver | Form-16/24Q/remittance, deducted-vs-MATCHED indicator, certify | pending, generated, certified, mismatch |
| Remittance Ledger | Payroll/Finance | per-scheme accrued→deposited→matched, deadline countdown, late-interest, challan capture | accrued, scheduled, deposited, matched, overdue, short-paid |
| GL Journal Viewer | Payroll/Finance | balanced debit/credit per gl_code, posting status | draft, exported, posted, acknowledged, rejected |
| FnF Workbench | HR/Payroll/DDO/Approver | consolidated settlement netting, PS11 handoff, sanction/approve | initiated, computed, reconciled, approved, paid, recovery-pending |
| Carryforward / Backlog Register | Payroll/Finance | un-recovered deductions, suspense holds, overdue remittances with ageing & owner | empty, open, ageing, cleared |
| Cost-to-Org Analytics | Approver/Finance | charts by org/cadre/component, scenario comparison, board-paper export | empty, loaded, scope-restricted |

**Global UI requirements:** WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard navigation & visible focus; dark mode; responsive at **375 / 768 / 1280 px** with touch targets ≥ 44×44 px (Vision §2.9) for self-service; money masked by default with reveal+audit (P02 ceiling); locale-formatted amounts; every screen covers empty/loading/error/no-permission/partial-data; no skeleton placeholders in production — real fields, data, API calls, and states.

## 8. API & Integration

### 8.1 Conventions (platform — Foundation §1; Recon §C)

REST under **`/api/v1`**; JSON; JWT bearer carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; **P02 `Authorization.check`** for every endpoint (no re-implemented permission logic); **cursor pagination only** (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100 + `cursor=`; response carries `next_cursor`); **`Idempotency-Key`** on all transaction-creating POSTs (24h replay returns the original result) — **mandatory for run start, disbursement transmit, off-cycle create, remittance, and FnF**; **`X-Correlation-Id`** carried/assigned on every request, echoed in the response header and written to every P05 audit and log line; effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` (staged, not live); all timestamps UTC ISO-8601.

### 8.2 Canonical Error Envelope (platform)

```json
{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "message": "state is required for PT_SLAB", "field": "state", "details": { } } }
```

2xx returns the resource payload; 4xx/5xx return the envelope above. The correlation id is the **`X-Correlation-Id` response header**, not a body `requestId`.

### 8.3 Error Codes

**Platform standard table (Foundation §1 — adopted verbatim):**

| Code | HTTP | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 422 | input failed a VAL-* / VAL-PS10-* rule |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | no/invalid session |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | authenticated but not permitted (never leaks out-of-scope existence) |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | resource absent or out of scope |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | idempotency replay, duplicate workflow start, state conflict |
| `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | 412 | a required precondition not met (incl. upstream/integration unavailable, mapped via X.3) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | rate limit exceeded |
| `INTERNAL` | 500 | unexpected server error |

**PS10 module business codes (`ERR-PS10-*`, registered in Foundation §5; each maps to a standard HTTP above):**

| Code | HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR-PS10-RULE-EXPR` | 422 | Bad formula expression |
| `ERR-PS10-DSL-PROPTEST` | 422 | FORMULA rule failed property tests |
| `ERR-PS10-RULE-OVERLAP` | 409 | Overlapping rule versions |
| `ERR-PS10-RATE-OVERLAP` | 409 | Overlapping rate rows |

| `ERR-PS10-TAXSLAB-NOTFOUND` | 422 | No tax slab for FY/regime |
| `ERR-PS10-PERQ-REFRATE` | 422 | No effective perquisite reference rate |
| `ERR-PS10-RECOVERY-NET` | 409 | Net too low for recovery (→carryforward) |
| `ERR-PS10-RECOVERY-BARRED` | 409 | Overpayment recovery barred pending authority adjudication |
| `ERR-PS10-OFFCYCLE-DUP` | 409 | Duplicate off-cycle payment |
| `ERR-PS10-RUN-INFLIGHT` | 409 | Another FINAL run in flight for the cycle |
| `ERR-PS10-SNAPSHOT-FROZEN` | 409 | Mutation attempted after snapshot freeze |
| `ERR-PS10-RECON-TIEOUT` | 409 | Control totals do not tie out (incl. disbursed+held+failed) |
| `ERR-PS10-RECON-UNSIGNED` | 409 | Approval before reconciliation sign-off |
| `ERR-PS10-RUN-NOTLOCKED` | 409 | Publish/disburse before lock |
| `ERR-PS10-REOPEN-BLOCKED` | 409 | Reopen after transmission |
| `ERR-PS10-BANK-INVALID` | 422 | Invalid/missing payee accounts (parked to holds) |
| `ERR-PS10-SIGNING-DOWN` | 412 | HSM/DSC signing service unavailable (X.3-mapped) |
| `ERR-PS10-RESEND-POSPAY` | 409 | Resend blocked until positive-pay non-debit confirmation |
| `ERR-PS10-RUN-IMMUTABLE` | 409 | Write to locked run/payslip |

> The v2 `VALIDATION_ERROR (400)`, `AUTH_REQUIRED (401)`, `INTERNAL_ERROR (500)`, and `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE (503)` are **retired** (Recon §C): use `VALIDATION_FAILED (422)`, `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `INTERNAL`, and — for upstream/integration failures — `PRECONDITION_FAILED (412)`/`INTERNAL (500)` via the **X.3** per-integration error mapping (`ERR-LOADFAIL` to the user). No 503 in the standard table.

## 10. Workflow & State Diagrams (State Tables)

## 11. Notifications (X.2 — MSG-PS10-*; W.3 recipient config)

All notifications run on the **X.2** infrastructure: `IN_APP` + `EMAIL` fire in parallel for approvals; **EMAIL for approval-workflow and statutory notifications is mandatory and non-suppressible** (BRD §9.9); retry exponential backoff up to 5 attempts + dead-letter queue; every dispatch audit-logged. Templates are referenced by **`MSG-PS10-*`** id (registered in Foundation §5), never inlined; recipients/channels are **W.3** config. Sensitive amounts are excluded from notification bodies (link to portal).

| Event | `MSG-PS10-*` | Recipient | Channel | Trigger FR |

## 12. Reporting & Analytics

All reports honour row-level org scope (P02), are cursor-paginated/exportable (CSV/PDF), and feed **PS14** dashboards. The three backlog registers (suspense holds, carryforwards, overdue remittances) surface managed exceptions as first-class views.

| Report | Audience | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Payroll Register | Payroll, Auditor | per-employee + component summary per run |
| Reconciliation Report | Payroll Approver | three-way tie-out, disbursed/held/failed, variance, exceptions |
| Statutory Remittance Ledger & Deadline Report | Payroll, Finance, Auditor | per-scheme accrued→deposited→matched, challan/CIN, overdue & late-interest |
| Suspense / Disbursement-Hold Register | Payroll, Finance | held net pay by reason, ageing, owner, re-disbursement status |
| Un-recovered Deduction (Carryforward) Backlog | Payroll, Finance | rolled-forward deductions by source, ageing, owner |
| Statutory Remittance Schedules | Payroll, Finance | PT/GPF/NPS/pension/TDS per period with splits |
| Form-16 / Form-24Q | Employee/Statutory | annual tax statement (Part A from MATCHED) / quarterly TDS return |
| GL Cost-Journal & Posting-Status Report | Payroll, Finance | balanced debit/credit per gl_code, posting status |
| Bank Disbursement & Ack Report | Payroll, Finance | batch totals, success/failed lines, positive-pay status |
| Cost-to-Organisation | Approver, Finance | gross/net/employer-cost by org/cadre/component/period |

## 13. Migration & Launch (P06 — ETL+V; payroll history = Wave 3, zero-tolerance)

Legacy payroll/statutory data migrates on the **P06 Migration Toolkit** (Extract → Validate → Transform → Load → Verify, idempotent; `migration_runs` ledger; `<enterprise>_source_id` traceability against the actual legacy register, not Darwinbox; three mandatory staging dry runs gate cutover). **Payroll history is P06 Wave 3 — explicitly zero-tolerance on numeric discrepancies** (Platform §P06).

### 13.1 Data Migration

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Master data | Load pay scales, pay-matrix levels, DA/HRA/PT-by-state/tax tables (effective-dated) |
| Employee structures | Migrate current salary structure per employee with version + history where available |
| Deduction setup | Migrate GPF/NPS/PT scheme assignments; seed YTD as a signed-off dataset reconstructable into the line ledger |
| Loans | Migrate outstanding loans with amortization remaining and recovered-to-date; flag concessional loans and seed perquisites |
| YTD accumulators | Load FY-to-date earnings/deductions/TDS for mid-year cutover as immutable seed lines (Form-16 continuity) |
| Benefits | Migrate enrolments, LTC block-year utilisation, gratuity accrual baseline, leave balances for encashment |
| Open obligations | Migrate open carryforwards, suspense holds (if any), and un-deposited statutory liabilities into the remittance ledger |

### 13.2 Validation & Parallel Run (P06 Wave-3 zero-tolerance gate — R18)

- Run a **parallel payroll** for at least 2 cycles vs the legacy system.
- **Gate (must pass before go-live):** reconcile to **zero variance** on (a) per-employee net, (b) YTD accumulators, and (c) per-scheme statutory totals (TDS/PT/GPF/NPS). Monthly-net-only reconciliation is insufficient. This is the **Wave-3 zero-tolerance** standard.
- The mid-year YTD seed is a verified, signed-off dataset; the line-ledger derivation must reproduce the seeded YTD exactly.
- Validate Form-24Q and Form-16 Part A against MATCHED remittances before first live filing.

### 13.3 Cutover & Launch

- Freeze legacy; lock migrated balances; run first live cycle in DRAFT, reconcile (incl. disbursed/held/failed), then FINAL.
- Phased rollout by org unit/cohort; self-service (payslip/declaration/FnF) enabled after first successful published cycle.
- Rollback plan: retain legacy read-only ≥ 4 weeks (P06); first-cycle abort path defined.
- **Sequencing:** PS10 cutover follows Phase-1 platform go-live and the Phase-2 payroll substrate (M06/M07) being live (Recon §E).

### 13.4 Launch Readiness Checklist

Master data loaded & approved (incl. PT-by-state); structures reconciled; YTD signed-off seed loaded & ledger-reproduced; **bank file format certified with bank in test AND DSC/HSM signing path provisioned and tested (a week-1 long-pole)**; **X.3 integrations registered with credentials in P04 (bank, TRACES/CRA, Finance ERP)**; positive-pay reconciliation channel established with treasury; reconciliation tie-out (incl. disbursed+held+failed) passing; **RBAC v1.7 roles/flags (`payroll_officer`/`payroll_approver`/`payroll_disburser`, `PAYROLL_APPROVE`/`PAYROLL_DISBURSE`/`DDO_SANCTION`) registered and SoD verified**; `JOB-PS10-*` registered in Foundation §4 and tested on X.1; `MSG-PS10-*` registered in Foundation §5; statutory output formats validated against TRACES/CRA; remittance challan-capture & GL export integration tested; **P05 audit logging & snapshot checksums verified**.

### 15.2 What PS10 authors vs consumes

- **PS10 authors (business logic only):** the pay-rules/DSL engine, computation pipeline, cross-module snapshot contract, derived-YTD ledger, statutory deduction/TDS/perquisite math, arrears cascade, disbursement anti-duplication protocol, remittance-to-MATCHED loop, GL cost-journal, FnF consolidation, and the public-sector `pay_scale`/allowance/deduction masters that extend PrimeSoft M06/M07.
- **PS10 consumes (never re-implements):** P01 (workflow/approval/lock), P02 (RBAC/authorization/PII masking), P04 (integration credentials), P05 (dual-log audit), P06 (migration), X.1 (jobs), X.2 (notifications), X.3 (integrations), W.1/W.2/W.3 (configured flows/forms/notification config), the `VAL-*` library, the RBAC v1.7 model, and the platform API/error/NFR conventions.
- **No `GAP (enterprise-specific)` *engine* is authored by PS10** — unlike PS11 pension or PS12 SR, payroll is an **EXTEND (roadmap)** of PrimeSoft M06/M07/M14, not a net-new statutory engine. The only net-new artefacts are public-sector master data and the `VAL-PS10-*`/`JOB-PS10-*`/`MSG-PS10-*`/`ERR-PS10-*` ids registered against the Foundation indexes.

### 15.3 Registered platform ids (Foundation indexes)

- **Jobs (Foundation §4):** `JOB-PS10-RUN`, `JOB-PS10-SNAPSHOT-FREEZE`, `JOB-PS10-ARREAR-SCAN`, `JOB-PS10-GRATUITY-ACCRUAL`, `JOB-PS10-REMIT-DEADLINE`.
- **Validation (Foundation §2):** reuse `VAL-PAN`, `VAL-AADHAAR`, `VAL-IFSC`, `VAL-CURRENCY`, `VAL-EFFECTIVE`, `VAL-DATE`, `VAL-FILE`, `VAL-ENUM`, `VAL-CONSENT`, `VAL-FNF`, `VAL-SEP`, `VAL-COMMENT`; author `VAL-PS10-DSL-TOKEN`, `VAL-PS10-RULE-ORDER`, `VAL-PS10-RATE-NONOVERLAP`, `VAL-PS10-IDENTITY`, `VAL-PS10-TIEOUT`, `VAL-PS10-YTD-DERIVE`.
- **Messages (Foundation §5):** `MSG-PS10-*` per §11; `ERR-PS10-*` per §8.3.
- **RBAC (RBAC §2.2/§4.3):** roles `payroll_officer`, `payroll_approver`, `payroll_disburser`; capability flags `PAYROLL_APPROVE`, `PAYROLL_DISBURSE`, `DDO_SANCTION`.

1. BASIC → 2. DA (% basic) → 3. HRA (city-class % basic) → 4. Transport & other allowances → 5. Special pay → 6. Perquisite (non-cash, taxable-income only) → 7. Gross earnings → 8. GPF/NPS (% basic / basic+DA) → 9. PT (state slab on gross) → 10. TDS (full pipeline) → 11. Loan recovery → 12. Court attachment/disciplinary recovery (by priority, within s.60 exemption) → 13. Voluntary deductions → 14. Rounding adjustment → 15. Net pay (with net-protection re-balancing; shortfall → carryforward).

### 16.2 Rounding & Money Rules

- All amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)`; rates `NUMERIC(9,4)`; no floating point.
- Component rounding per `pay_rules.rounding`; default NEAREST (half-up) to rupee; statutory deductions use prescribed rounding.
- A `ROUNDING_ADJUSTMENT` component absorbs `Σ(rounded) − round(Σ)` per payslip so gross/net identities tie to the rupee.
- **Remittance tolerance:** a documented per-scheme tolerance absorbs the residue of summed per-employee statutory pennies against NSDL-CRA / GPF reconciliation; variance beyond tolerance is an exception, not a silent pass.

### 16.3 Net-Pay Protection, Attachment Exemption & Recovery Priority

- **Protected floor:** a configurable minimum net (by cadre/jurisdiction); deductions cannot push net below it.
- **Court-attachment exemption:** computed independently per CPC s.60 (not the flat floor); the attachable portion is bounded by statute.
- **Priority:** statutory (TDS/PT/GPF/NPS) → court attachment (within s.60) → disciplinary recovery → overpayment recovery (after legal-eligibility check) → loans → voluntary.
- Spillover below floor/exemption is rolled into `deduction_carryforwards` (owned, aged), not dropped.

### 16.4 Immutability & Correction Policy

A LOCKED run and its payslips are immutable (P05 DB-trigger audit + append-only versioning). Corrections never edit the original; they are issued as: (a) arrears (FR-10), (b) supplementary/off-cycle (FR-11), (c) recovery (FR-09), or (d) reopen-with-versioning (FR-16) pre-transmission, which supersedes the original into a new version with a lock-to-lock diff. Each correction references the original run; YTD always derives from the surviving (non-superseded) line ledger.

### 16.5 Assumptions Log

- One PrimeSoft tenant; each department/directorate an entity; PT supports multiple states within the entity.
- Bank/treasury supports one documented, certified file format; ISO20022/CUSTOM deferred behind a `FileFormatStrategy` seam.
- Enterprise notifications drive rate-table updates; entered by SysAdmin (Org Admin) and approved by Payroll Approver via P01.
- 30-day vs actual-days LWP basis is a configurable policy switch.
- DSC/HSM signing infrastructure and a treasury positive-pay channel are available (week-1 long-pole); integration credentials live in **P04**, calls run on **X.3**.
- Finance ERP accepts a structured cost-journal export over X.3 and returns a posting acknowledgement.
- Phase-2 sequencing: PS10 follows Phase-1 platform + Phase-2 payroll substrate (M06/M07) go-live.

### 16.6 Subsistence Allowance & Dies-Non (R13)

- **Subsistence (suspended employees):** initial = configured % of pay (default 50% of pay + applicable DA) for the first configured period; escalates by a configured step after N months of continued suspension (default: increase after 3 and again after 6 months), subject to authority review. Statutory deductions compute on the subsistence base.
- **Dies-non:** a period yields no pay and no qualifying service; neither LWP nor leave; suppresses earnings for those days and is flagged to **PS12** for the service record.

### 16.7 Formula DSL Semantics & Security (R14)

- **Grammar versioning:** `dsl_grammar_version`, versioned independently of `pay_rules.version`; FORMULA components pin the grammar; upgrades re-validate/quarantine existing rules.
- **Decimal semantics:** fixed-point `NUMERIC`; no binary float.
- **Null propagation:** any null operand raises a rule exception (never silently 0).
- **Precedence:** explicit, documented; ambiguous expressions rejected at parse time.
- **Whitelist:** only whitelisted operators/functions/component-code/employee-attribute references; no I/O, loops, or code execution.
- **Concessional-loan perquisite (Rule 3):** value = reducing monthly outstanding × ((reference rate − charged rate) / 12), summed over the FY; reference rate is effective-dated master data.
- **Property tests:** decimal rounding, null propagation, precedence, division-by-zero, and circular-reference detection must pass before a FORMULA rule activates (`VAL-PS10-DSL-TOKEN`/`VAL-PS10-RULE-ORDER`).

### 16.8 Mid-Month Inter-DDO Transfer Rule (R16)

- **Default — DDO-of-record:** the DDO-of-record for the transfer month (snapshotted DDO at cutoff, or destination DDO per policy) pays the full month; control account and bank file attribute to that DDO.
- **Optional — split-period payslip:** where policy requires, the month is split at the transfer date into two segments, each attributed to its DDO's control account, reconciled to the same employee net.
- The chosen mode is configurable; the snapshot (FR-22) records the DDO-of-record so disbursement and control-account attribution are deterministic.

### 16.9 Disbursement Anti-Duplication Protocol (R1/R2)

1. Each transmission (over **X.3**) carries a unique `bank_batch_ref`; the bank echoes it on ack.
2. Excluded/invalid-account net pay is parked in `disbursement_holds` (suspense), preserving `Σ disbursed + Σ held + Σ failed = run net`.
3. On gateway timeout/ambiguous ack the batch enters `SUSPECTED_PROCESSED`; no resend is permitted until a positive-pay/treasury-debit reconciliation confirms the credits did not post.
4. A confirmed non-debit allows resend under a new `bank_batch_ref`; a confirmed debit moves the batch to RECONCILED.
5. The DSC/HSM signature provides authenticity/non-repudiation (keys in HSM, never in DB); the checksum provides integrity only. The positive-pay confirmer must differ from the transmitter (SoD enforced by P02). Outbound calls are idempotent and circuit-broken by the **X.3** framework.
