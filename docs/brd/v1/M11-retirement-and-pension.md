## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Retirement and Pension Management module (**M11-PEN**) governs the complete lifecycle of an employee's separation from service and the lifelong administration of their pensionary and terminal benefits. It manages every **separation type** (superannuation/age retirement, voluntary retirement (VRS), compulsory retirement ordered under disciplinary proceedings, invalidation/medical retirement, death-in-service, and resignation); computes **qualifying service** and the full benefit set (basic pension, commutation, family/enhanced family pension, retirement and death gratuity, leave encashment, GPF final withdrawal); generates the statutory **Pension Payment Order (PPO)**; and maintains the **pensioner master** and pensioner lifecycle (life-certificate/Jeevan Pramaan, restoration of commuted portion, conversion to family pension on a pensioner's death, and pension revision on DA or pay-commission changes).

M11 is engineered as a **rule-driven, audit-grade benefit engine** that is deterministic and reproducible. Benefits are never hand-keyed; they are *derived* from verified service history in the **Digital Service Register (M12)**, last-pay-drawn and contribution history from **Payroll (M10)**, leave balances from **M03**, and disciplinary orders from **M09**, evaluated against versioned, effective-dated pension rule tables. Once a benefit case is **sanctioned and a PPO is issued, the calculation snapshot is immutable** — corrections flow only through controlled revision/re-issue with full audit. Every rupee of pension is traceable from qualifying-service input through PPO to disbursement.

### 1.2 Business Context and Problem Statement

Public-sector retirement processing is high-stakes, statutorily intricate, and time-critical: an employee who superannuates on the last day of a month must receive pension from the next day without a break. Processing combines **service-record verification** (gap-free service from joining to retirement), **qualifying-service arithmetic** (deducting non-qualifying spells such as extraordinary leave without pay, dies-non, and unauthorised absence), **dual pension regimes** (Old Pension Scheme (OPS) for pre-cutoff entrants vs the National Pension System (NPS) for later entrants), **commutation actuarial factors**, **family-pension rules** (normal vs enhanced rates and eligibility windows), **gratuity ceilings**, and **DA/pay-commission revisions** applied to a live pensioner population for decades. Manual processing produces delayed first pensions, miscalculated benefits, audit objections, litigation, and hardship to families of deceased employees. M11 eliminates these by making the rule set explicit and versioned, the computation reproducible and traceable, the workflow gated by service verification and no-dues, and the pensioner lifecycle fully digital.

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives

| # | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Zero break in pension | First pension/anticipatory pension authorised on/before the day after retirement for 100% of cases |
| G2 | Deterministic, reproducible benefit computation | Re-running a case with identical verified inputs yields byte-identical benefit figures and trace |
| G3 | Statutory accuracy | 100% correct qualifying-service, pension, commutation, gratuity, family-pension computation against published rules |
| G4 | Service-verified eligibility | No PPO issued without M12 SR verification complete and no-dues cleared |
| G5 | Digital, self-service retirement | Retiring employee tracks case, runs estimators, and submits forms online; pensioner submits Digital Life Certificate online |
| G6 | Lifelong pensioner integrity | Correct DA/pay-commission revision, commuted-portion restoration, and family-pension conversion across the pensioner's life |
| G7 | Forecasting & liability transparency | Accurate due-for-retirement forecasts and pension-liability analytics by org unit, cadre, and horizon |

### 1.4 Scope Summary

In scope: retirement forecasting & due-for-retirement lists; separation-case management for all separation types; pre-retirement processing (1–2 years ahead: SR verification with M12, no-dues clearance, anticipatory pension); qualifying-service computation with non-qualifying-spell deduction; pension calculation (basic, NPS vs OPS handling); commutation; retirement & death gratuity; family & enhanced family pension; terminal benefits & final settlement (incl. leave encashment from M03, GPF final withdrawal); PPO generation (incl. digital PPO); pensioner master & lifecycle (life certificate/Jeevan Pramaan, restoration of commuted portion, family-pension conversion on pensioner death); pension revision on DA/pay-commission; treasury/bank/Pension Disbursing Authority (PDA) integration; retirement self-service portal & benefit estimators/what-if; pensioner grievance management; and forecasting & pension-liability analytics.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): the canonical employee master (M01); the SR ledger itself (M12) — M11 reads/verifies and appends retirement events; payroll computation of in-service salary and the monthly active-employee payslip (M10) — M11 consumes last-pay-drawn and contribution history; leave capture and encashable-balance maintenance (M03); disciplinary adjudication that issues a compulsory-retirement penalty order (M09) — M11 consumes the order; document storage internals (M13); and core banking/treasury ledger posting beyond producing and reconciling the disbursement file.

### 1.5 Key Stakeholders

Retiring Employee / Pensioner / Family Pensioner (self-service), Pension Officer/Dealing Assistant (maker), Pension Sanctioning Authority / Head of Office (checker), HR Officer/Admin, SR Custodian/Registrar (M12), Payroll Officer (M10 last-pay & contributions), Department Head / Appointing Authority, Treasury / Pension Disbursing Authority (PDA) / Bank, Medical Board (invalidation), Auditor, System Administrator.

### 1.6 Success Criteria

A retirement case is "successful" when: the separation is recorded with the correct type and date; service is verified gap-free in M12; no-dues is cleared; qualifying service and all benefits are computed deterministically with full trace and sanctioned by an authority distinct from the maker; the PPO (and where applicable anticipatory pension) is issued before pension commencement; terminal benefits and GPF are settled; the pensioner is enrolled in the pensioner master; the disbursement instruction is accepted by the PDA/bank; and a retirement event is appended to M12 — all with a complete, immutable audit trail.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from Shared Foundation)

All M11 features inherit: UUID PKs + human business keys; standard audit fields; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE status enums; UTC storage / locale display; `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates; INR default currency with i18n money formatting; paginated list endpoints (max page 100); maker-checker via the shared workflow engine; RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; immutable `audit_log` write on every state change; `documents` (M13) for generated artefacts (PPO, sanction orders, calculation sheets); `notifications` for events; `service_register_events` (M12) for retirement/separation events.

### 2.3 In-Scope / Out-of-Scope Boundary Table

| Concern | In M11? | Owner / Note |
|---|---|---|
| Employee master data | Reference only | M01 (golden source) |
| Service history / SR ledger | Verify & append | M12 owns ledger; M11 verifies gap-free service & appends retirement events |
| Last-pay-drawn & contribution history | Consume only | M10 supplies emoluments base, GPF/NPS contributions |
| Leave encashable balance | Consume only | M03 supplies encashable EL balance; M11 computes encashment amount |
| Compulsory-retirement penalty order | Consume the order | M09 adjudicates; M11 processes the resulting separation |
| Disciplinary recovery against benefits | Consume; net from settlement | M09 issues recovery; M11 nets within statutory protection |
| Active-employee payroll run | Out | M10 (M11 begins at separation/retirement) |
| Pension monthly disbursement ledger | Instruction + reconcile | PDA/Treasury/Bank disburse; M11 instructs & reconciles |
| Document storage internals | Reference | M13 stores PPO/sanction/calc-sheet objects |
| Medical fitness adjudication | Consume verdict | Medical Board issues invalidation certificate; M11 records & uses it |

### 2.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- Pension/commutation/gratuity rules, DA rates for pensioners, commutation factors by age, family-pension rates, and gratuity ceilings are **configurable, effective-dated master data**, sourced from enterprise notifications and version-controlled.
- The OPS/NPS cutover date (date of joining boundary) is configurable; scheme is derived from `employees.date_of_joining` and recorded contribution history, overridable with justification and audit.
- A single legal entity per deployment; the data model is entity-aware (`legal_entity_id`) for future multi-entity.
- All money math uses fixed-point decimal (`NUMERIC`); rounding rules per statutory prescription are explicit and configurable (default benefit rounding to the next higher rupee where rules so require).
- "Emoluments" / "average emoluments" base and the reckonable period (e.g., last-drawn vs 10-month average, whichever beneficial) are configurable policy parameters resolved per case and snapshotted.
- Digital Life Certificate integrates with a Jeevan Pramaan-style service; manual life-certificate capture is always available as a fallback.

**Segregation of duties:** maker ≠ checker is enforced — the Pension Officer who computes/prepares a case cannot sanction it or authorise its PPO; the SysAdmin who maintains rule tables cannot sanction a case in which they are the subject. SR verification (M12 Custodian) and no-dues sign-offs are independent control points.

## 4. Shared Application Foundation

M11 inherits the Shared Foundation §5 technical defaults verbatim: React + TypeScript (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) frontend; REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL primary store; encrypted object storage for PPOs/sanction orders/calculation sheets; OIDC/SSO + MFA; JWT + RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; canonical error envelope; OWASP ASVS; TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest; DPDP Act 2023 alignment; P95 < 500ms (interactive), batch SLAs in §10; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h.

**M11-specific foundation extensions:**

- **Money type:** `NUMERIC(15,2)` for all benefit amounts; rates/factors as `NUMERIC(9,4)`; service durations as integer years/months/days; no floating point in computation.
- **Computation determinism:** every benefit engine is a pure function of (verified service record, emoluments snapshot, scheme, rule tables effective on the relevant date, beneficiary data). Same inputs → same outputs; a `calc_trace` (JSONB) is persisted with each calculation.
- **Immutability:** a sanctioned calculation and its issued PPO are append-only snapshots; corrections create a new revision linked to the original (no silent edit).
- **Idempotency:** all case-progression, PPO-issue, revision, and disbursement mutating endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key` header.
- **Transactionality:** sanction, PPO issue, and family-pension conversion each commit as all-or-nothing transactions; multi-step settlement writes use transactions.
- **Encryption & PII:** bank account numbers, PAN/national_id, nominee details, and benefit amounts are PII/financial data — encrypted at rest, masked in UI by default, access logged. Deceased-employee/family-pensioner data handled with heightened sensitivity.

### 5.6 Data Integrity Rules

- **IR1:** At most one `separation_cases` row per employee in a non-terminal status (DRAFT..PPO_ISSUED).
- **IR2:** `qualifying_service_records.net_qualifying_*` = gross − sum(`non_qualifying_spells.days` where not condoned); `sr_verified=true` required before case → CALCULATION.
- **IR3:** A case cannot reach PENDING_SANCTION unless `no_dues_status=CLEARED` (or anticipatory-pension exception explicitly authorised) **and** `qualifying_service_records.status=LOCKED`.
- **IR4:** `commutation_records.commuted_fraction ≤` statutory max; `residual_pension = basic_pension − commuted_pension_amount ≥ 0`.
- **IR5:** `gratuity_calculations.payable_amount = min(computed_amount, statutory_ceiling)`; `ceiling_applied` set accordingly.
- **IR6:** PPO issue requires case `status=SANCTIONED`; `ppo_no` unique and registry-allocated; a REVISED PPO must reference `supersedes_ppo_id` and supersede exactly one ACTIVE PPO.
- **IR7:** A `pensioners` row is created only on PPO authorisation; `current_ppo_id` always points to the single ACTIVE PPO.
- **IR8:** On `pensioners.date_of_death` set for a SELF_PENSIONER, a `family_pension_records` (CONVERTED) row and a FAMILY_PENSION PPO must be created or the case flagged; original pensioner moves to CONVERTED_TO_FAMILY.
- **IR9:** `pension_revisions` lines are immutable once APPLIED; corrections create a new revision batch.
- **IR10:** Life certificate overdue beyond grace ⇒ `pensioners.lifecycle_status=SUSPENDED_NO_LC` and monthly disbursement held (not deleted).
- **IR11:** Sum of `nominees_beneficiaries.share_pct` per `benefit_scope` (where apportioned) = 100.00 when status ACTIVE.
- **IR12:** All money `NUMERIC`; no floating point; benefit rounding per `rule_version_ref`.
- **IR13:** Sanctioned `pension_calculations`/`commutation_records`/`gratuity_calculations` are immutable (status SUPERSEDED on revision; never updated in place).

## 6. Functional Requirements

### FR-M11-01 — Retirement Forecasting & Due-for-Retirement Lists

- **Module:** M11-F01
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want an automatically refreshed list of employees due to retire by horizon so that processing can start 1–2 years ahead and no first pension is delayed.
- **Description:** Compute each active employee's projected superannuation date from `dob` + applicable retirement age (cadre-specific rule), classify into horizon buckets, surface those due within 24/12/6 months, flag whether a case is already initiated, and drive proactive alerts and workload planning. Refreshed nightly and on-demand.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Projected retirement date = last day of the month in which the employee attains the configured superannuation age (per cadre rule), recomputed on DOB/cadre change.
  - AC2: Lists filter by org unit, cadre, horizon bucket, and "case not yet initiated".
  - AC3: Employees crossing the 18-month threshold without a case trigger an alert to the responsible Pension Officer.
  - AC4: The forecast excludes employees already separated (RETIRED/DECEASED/RESIGNED/TERMINATED).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Retirement age is configurable by cadre/category (e.g., 60/62/65). BR2: Forecast is read-only projection; it never auto-creates a case (Pension Officer initiates). BR3: Mid-month attainment retires on the month-end per policy.
- **Data Model References:** `retirement_forecasts`, `employees` (read), `org_units` (read), `separation_cases` (case_initiated flag).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/forecasts` | due-for-retirement list (filters: horizon, org_unit, cadre) |

### FR-M11-02 — Separation Case Management (All Separation Types)

- **Module:** M11-F02
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to create and drive a separation case for any separation type so that the correct rules, workflow, and benefit set apply from the start.
- **Description:** Create a `separation_cases` record selecting the type (superannuation/VRS/compulsory/invalidation/death-in-service/resignation), derive the pension scheme (OPS/NPS), capture type-specific inputs (VRS notice, M09 compulsory-retirement order ref, medical-board ref, death report ref), and progress the case through the standard state machine with maker-checker gates. Type drives which downstream FRs are mandatory (e.g., death-in-service → family pension + death gratuity; resignation → typically no pension, only GPF/leave encashment subject to rules).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each type enforces its required inputs (e.g., COMPULSORY_RETIREMENT requires a valid M09 order ref; INVALIDATION requires a medical-board certificate; DEATH_IN_SERVICE requires date of death and nominee data).
  - AC2: Scheme (OPS/NPS) is auto-derived from DOJ vs cutover and shown; override requires reason + audit.
  - AC3: Only an authority distinct from the maker can sanction (SoD).
  - AC4: Resignation/dismissal paths correctly suppress pension where rules disallow it and still allow GPF/leave settlement.
  - AC5: At most one active case per employee (IR1) is enforced.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Compulsory retirement is initiated only from an M09 penalty order. BR2: Death-in-service auto-spawns the family-pension and death-gratuity sub-flows. BR3: VRS requires minimum qualifying service per rule and may add weightage. BR4: A case cannot skip SR verification or no-dues except via explicit anticipatory-pension exception.

### FR-M11-03 — Pre-Retirement Processing (SR Verification, No-Dues, Anticipatory Pension)

- **Module:** M11-F03
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, SR Custodian (M12), HR Admin, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to run SR verification, drive no-dues clearance, and authorise anticipatory pension 1–2 years ahead so that benefits are ready before the retirement date and pension never breaks.
- **Description:** Orchestrate the lead pipeline: request gap-free service verification from M12 (SR Custodian certifies), coordinate no-dues clearance across stakeholders (payroll/loans, library, quarters, IT assets, etc.), and — when final pension cannot be sanctioned in time — authorise **anticipatory pension** (a provisional pension/gratuity within rule limits) so the pensioner is paid from day one, later adjusted against the final sanction.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Case cannot advance to CALCULATION until `qualifying_service_records.sr_verified=true`.
  - AC2: No-dues is a checklist with per-item owner/status; case cannot reach PENDING_SANCTION until CLEARED (or anticipatory exception).
  - AC3: Anticipatory pension issues a provisional PPO (ANTICIPATORY) within the configured percentage cap and is later superseded by the final PPO with adjustment.
  - AC4: Outstanding dues are recorded and netted into terminal settlement, not silently ignored.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Anticipatory pension ≤ configured % of estimated pension; anticipatory gratuity withheld until no-dues. BR2: SR verification gaps must be condoned by order before counting as qualifying. BR3: No-dues blocking items hold gratuity but not the basic anticipatory pension.
- **Data Model References:** `separation_cases` (no_dues_status, anticipatory_pension_flag), `qualifying_service_records`, `service_register_events` (read/verify), `ppo_records` (ANTICIPATORY), `terminal_settlements` (recoveries).

### FR-M11-04 — Qualifying Service Computation

- **Module:** M11-F04
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, SR Custodian
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want qualifying service computed from verified service with non-qualifying spells deducted so that pension and gratuity use the legally correct service length.
- **Description:** Compute gross service from joining to retirement/death, enumerate non-qualifying spells (extraordinary leave/LWP not counting, dies-non, unauthorised absence, certain suspension periods, breaks in service) sourced from M03/M04/M09 and manual entries, deduct uncondoned spells, apply weightage where applicable (e.g., VRS), and round to reckonable half-years per rule. Produces an auditable, locked `qualifying_service_records`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: `net_qualifying = gross − Σ(uncondoned non-qualifying days)`; condoned spells count as qualifying.
  - AC2: Reckonable half-years rounded per the configured rounding rule (e.g., ≥3 months counts as a half-year).
  - AC3: Each non-qualifying spell traces to a source (M03/M04 leave event, M09 order, or manual with justification).
  - AC4: VRS weightage is added only when rules permit and within the cap (and capped at the date-of-superannuation service).
  - AC5: Record locks on verification; later changes require a new version.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: EOL on medical certificate may be qualifying; EOL otherwise non-qualifying (policy flag). BR2: Dies-non never qualifies. BR3: Minimum qualifying service for pension eligibility is enforced (else proportionate/no pension per rule).
- **Data Model References:** `qualifying_service_records`, `non_qualifying_spells`, `service_register_events` (read), M03/M04 leave (read), M09 orders (read).

### FR-M11-05 — Pension Calculation (OPS / NPS)

- **Module:** M11-F05
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want basic pension computed from emoluments and qualifying service under the correct scheme so that the monthly pension is statutorily accurate.
- **Description:** For OPS, compute basic pension = pension-fraction × emoluments base (last-drawn or 10-month average, whichever beneficial), using qualifying half-years, apply proportionate reduction for short qualifying service, and floor/cap to statutory minimum/maximum. For NPS, M11 does not compute a defined-benefit pension; it records corpus/PRAN references and produces indicative annuity/lump-sum figures plus any NPS-specific additional relief, routing to the NPS annuity service. A full `calc_trace` and effective rule snapshot are persisted.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: OPS basic pension = configured fraction (e.g., 50%) of emoluments base for full qualifying service; proportionate below the threshold.
  - AC2: Emoluments method selectable (last-drawn / 10-month average / beneficial-of-both) and snapshotted from M10.
  - AC3: Statutory minimum and maximum pension are enforced with flags set.
  - AC4: NPS cases are clearly marked non-OPS; defined-benefit pension is not fabricated; indicative figures labelled non-binding.
  - AC5: Re-computation with identical inputs is byte-identical; rule version is recorded.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Scheme from `separation_cases.pension_scheme`. BR2: Emoluments exclude non-reckonable allowances per rule. BR3: Additional old-age pension increments (e.g., at 80/85/90/95/100 years) are scheduled as future revisions (FR-13).

### FR-M11-06 — Commutation of Pension

- **Module:** M11-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Retiring Employee (opt), Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a retiring employee, I want to commute a portion of my pension into a lump sum so that I receive upfront capital, with my residual pension and restoration date correctly computed.
- **Description:** Capture the employee's commutation option (fraction ≤ statutory maximum), look up the commutation factor by age-next-birthday, compute commuted value = commuted monthly pension × factor × 12, reduce the monthly pension to residual, and schedule restoration of the commuted portion after the statutory period (e.g., 15 years).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Commuted fraction is bounded by the statutory maximum (e.g., 40%); over-limit is rejected.
  - AC2: Commutation factor resolves from the effective age-factor table by age-next-birthday.
  - AC3: Commuted value, residual pension, and restoration due date are computed and shown with trace.
  - AC4: Residual pension feeds the PPO; restoration is scheduled and later applied (FR-12) restoring full basic.
  - AC5: Opting out leaves full basic pension and no commuted value.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Commutation requires medical fitness unless within the no-medical window post-retirement. BR2: Restoration date = commutation date + statutory restoration period. BR3: Commuted portion still attracts DA on full (un-commuted) basic per rule.
- **Data Model References:** `commutation_records`, `pension_calculations` (read), commutation-factor rule table (read).

### FR-M11-07 — Gratuity Computation (Retirement & Death)

- **Module:** M11-F07
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want retirement and death gratuity computed with the correct service slabs and statutory ceiling so that the lump-sum terminal benefit is accurate and within limits.
- **Description:** Compute retirement gratuity = ¼ × emoluments (basic+DA) × qualifying half-years (capped, e.g., max 16.5×emoluments / 66 half-years), and death gratuity by service-length slabs (e.g., <1yr=2×, 1–5yr=6×, 5–11yr=12×, 11–20yr=20×, >20yr=½×emoluments per half-year), each capped at the statutory ceiling and apportioned to nominees for death cases.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Retirement gratuity uses capped qualifying half-years and the statutory ceiling; `payable=min(computed,ceiling)`.
  - AC2: Death gratuity applies the correct slab multiplier by service length.
  - AC3: Death gratuity is apportioned per nominee shares totalling 100%.
  - AC4: Gratuity may be withheld pending no-dues and released on clearance.
  - AC5: Ceiling-applied and withheld flags are set and visible.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Emoluments = basic + DA at retirement/death date. BR2: Half-years capped per rule. BR3: Statutory ceiling effective-dated; the ceiling on the relevant date applies. BR4: No minimum-service bar for death gratuity (payable from day one of service).

### FR-M11-08 — Family & Enhanced Family Pension

- **Module:** M11-F08
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want family pension computed with normal and enhanced rates and the correct beneficiary so that the family of a deceased employee/pensioner is paid accurately and the right person receives it over time.
- **Description:** Compute family pension at the normal rate (e.g., 30% of emoluments) and, where eligible, the enhanced rate (e.g., 50%) for a limited window (e.g., 7 years or until the employee would have turned 67/age rule, whichever earlier). Maintain the ordered beneficiary hierarchy (spouse → eligible children by age → disabled child for life → dependent parents), eligibility review dates (minor majority, remarriage, disability), and transfer of pension to the next beneficiary on cessation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Normal and enhanced amounts compute from emoluments × configured rates.
  - AC2: Enhanced family pension applies only within the eligible window, then steps down to normal automatically (scheduled).
  - AC3: The active beneficiary follows the hierarchy; on a cessation event, pension transfers to the next eligible beneficiary, not stops (unless none remain).
  - AC4: Disabled-dependent beneficiaries receive lifelong family pension per rule.
  - AC5: Both death-in-service and conversion-on-pensioner-death paths produce a family-pension record and a FAMILY_PENSION PPO.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Enhanced rate min(enhanced formula, would-be pension) per rule. BR2: Only one beneficiary draws at a time (except twins/eligible split per rule). BR3: Remarriage/employment may cease eligibility except for disabled children/widow per rule.
- **Data Model References:** `family_pension_records`, `nominees_beneficiaries`, `pension_calculations` (read), `pensioners` (source on conversion).

### FR-M11-09 — Terminal Benefits & Final Settlement

- **Module:** M11-F09
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Payroll Officer (M10)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a composite final settlement that brings together leave encashment, gratuity, commuted value, GPF, and recoveries so that the employee's one-time dues are paid net of legitimate recoveries.
- **Description:** Assemble the terminal settlement: compute leave encashment from M03 encashable EL balance × per-day emoluments (capped per rule), pull gratuity (FR-07), commuted value (FR-06), and GPF (FR-10), add other dues (group/deposit-linked insurance), net legitimate recoveries (M09 disciplinary, overpayment, outstanding loans/advances) within statutory protection, and produce gross and net settlement for authorisation and disbursement.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Leave encashment = min(encashable EL days, statutory cap) × per-day (basic+DA); shown as a line.
  - AC2: Settlement gross = Σ components; net = gross − recoveries; each recovery traces to an order.
  - AC3: Recoveries cannot exceed statutory limits; excess is deferred/flagged, never silently dropped.
  - AC4: Withheld components (e.g., gratuity pending no-dues, or pending disciplinary case) are excluded from immediate payout and tracked.
  - AC5: Final settlement requires SANCTIONED benefit sub-calculations.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Leave encashment capped per rule (e.g., 300 days). BR2: Recovery priority and net protection per Appendix 16.3. BR3: Pending disciplinary case may withhold gratuity per M09 linkage.

### FR-M11-10 — GPF Final Withdrawal

- **Module:** M11-F10
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Payroll Officer (M10)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want the GPF final balance with interest and advances adjusted so that the provident-fund corpus is settled correctly at retirement or death.
- **Description:** Retrieve the GPF closing balance and contribution ledger from M10, compute interest up to the settlement date, deduct any outstanding GPF advances/withdrawals, derive the final payable, apportion to nominees for death cases, and route for authorisation. (NPS cases are handled via NPS exit, not GPF.)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Final payable = closing balance + interest-to-date − outstanding advances.
  - AC2: Interest computed at the effective GPF rate for the period to settlement.
  - AC3: Death cases apportion to nominees totalling 100%.

### FR-M11-11 — PPO Generation & Digital PPO

- **Module:** M11-F11
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (prepare), Sanctioning Authority (authorise)
- **User Story:** As a Sanctioning Authority, I want to issue a registry-numbered Pension Payment Order so that the pensioner's entitlement is formally authorised and transmitted to the disbursing authority.
- **Description:** Generate the PPO from the sanctioned pension (and family pension/commutation) figures, allocate a unique `ppo_no` from the registry, render a digital PPO (e-PPO) document (M13), bind it to a Pension Disbursing Authority, and produce the pensioner half / disbursing-authority half. Supports SERVICE_PENSION, FAMILY_PENSION, ANTICIPATORY, and REVISED PPOs; a REVISED PPO supersedes the prior active PPO with continuity of `ppo_no` lineage.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: PPO issues only when the case is SANCTIONED (or anticipatory authorised for ANTICIPATORY type).
  - AC2: `ppo_no` is unique and registry-allocated; a REVISED PPO references and supersedes exactly one ACTIVE PPO.
  - AC3: e-PPO is generated as a signed document artefact and made available to the pensioner self-service.
  - AC4: PPO carries basic pension, commuted portion, residual, effective-from, and PDA binding.
  - AC5: Authorising the PPO creates/links the pensioner master record (FR-12).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Anticipatory PPO is provisional and superseded by the final PPO. BR2: Authoriser ≠ preparer (SoD). BR3: PPO effective-from = pension commencement date.
- **Data Model References:** `ppo_records`, `pension_calculations`, `commutation_records`, `family_pension_records`, `pensioners`, `documents`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

### FR-M11-12 — Pensioner Master & Lifecycle Management

- **Module:** M11-F12
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Pensioner/Family Pensioner (self-service), Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a pensioner master that tracks life certificates, restoration, and family-pension conversion so that the pensioner is correctly maintained for life and beyond.
- **Description:** Maintain the `pensioners` record from PPO authorisation onward: capture annual life certificate / Digital Life Certificate (Jeevan Pramaan-style), suspend disbursement on overdue LC, restore the commuted portion automatically at the restoration due date (full basic pension resumes), and on a self-pensioner's death convert to family pension — creating the family-pension record and FAMILY_PENSION PPO and transferring disbursement to the eligible beneficiary.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Life certificate has a yearly due date; overdue beyond grace sets `SUSPENDED_NO_LC` and holds disbursement.
  - AC2: Submitting/verifying an LC (digital or physical) reactivates the pensioner and releases held pension with arrear.
  - AC3: At the restoration due date, the commuted portion is restored and `current_monthly_pension` reflects full basic (FR-06 link).
  - AC4: On `date_of_death` for a self-pensioner, the system spawns family-pension conversion (FR-08) and a FAMILY_PENSION PPO, moving the pensioner to CONVERTED_TO_FAMILY.
  - AC5: Pensioner contact/bank self-updates route through maker-checker before disbursement uses them.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: LC grace period configurable. BR2: Restoration applies only to the original pensioner (not transferred to family pension). BR3: Family-pension conversion uses the recorded beneficiary hierarchy.
- **Data Model References:** `pensioners`, `pensioner_life_certificates`, `commutation_records` (restoration), `family_pension_records`, `ppo_records`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/pensioners/{id}` | pensioner detail & lifecycle |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/pensioners/{id}/life-certificate` | submit LC / DLC |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/pensioners/{id}:report-death` | record death → conversion |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/pension/pensioners/{id}` | update bank/contact (maker-checker) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Pensioner 360 view: pension summary, LC status with due/overdue badges, restoration countdown, conversion history, and bank/contact with masked reveal; pensioner self-service LC submission (digital with fallback) and grievance entry.
- **Edge Cases:** Restoration date coinciding with a DA revision; death reported late (arrears/over-payment recovery from estate); LC submitted just after suspension; family pensioner's own death (next beneficiary); fraudulent LC detection.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `PensionerService`, `LifeCertificateProcessor` (DLC client), `RestorationJob`, `DeathConversionOrchestrator` |
| Backend Flow | On PPO auth create pensioner → schedule LC due & restoration → LC submit/verify toggles active/suspended → restoration job restores basic → death triggers FR-08 conversion + FAMILY PPO |

### FR-M11-13 — Pension Revision (DA & Pay-Commission)

- **Module:** M11-F13
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), SysAdmin (rule tables)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to apply DA and pay-commission revisions across the pensioner population so that every pensioner's pension stays current with arrears computed automatically.
- **Description:** Run revision batches: a DA revision applies a new dearness-relief percentage to eligible pensioners; a pay-commission revision re-fixes basic pension per the new formula/multiplier and notional pay fixation. Compute old vs new pension and retrospective arrears, approve the batch, and apply per-pensioner deltas (updating `pensioners.current_monthly_pension` and queuing arrear disbursements). Also schedules additional old-age pension increments (e.g., at 80/85/90/95/100 years).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A DA-revision batch recomputes dearness relief for all eligible pensioners as of the effective date.
  - AC2: A pay-commission batch re-fixes basic pension and computes arrears from the effective date.
  - AC3: Old vs new and arrear amounts are computed per pensioner with trace; batch requires approval before APPLY.
  - AC4: Applied revisions are immutable; corrections create a new batch.
  - AC5: Age-based additional pension increments auto-apply on the pensioner's milestone birthday.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: DA/pay-commission parameters are effective-dated master data (SysAdmin maintained, approved). BR2: Family pensioners are revised by the same batch with family-pension rules. BR3: Arrears netting respects any prior over-payment.
- **Data Model References:** `pension_revisions`, `pensioners`, rule tables (DA/pay-commission), `pension_disbursements` (arrears).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| POST | `/api/v1/pension/revisions/{id}:approve` | approve batch |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/revisions/{id}:apply` | apply to pensioners |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Revision console with batch parameters, computed delta preview (old→new, arrear), affected-count, exception list, approve/apply gates, and rollback-before-apply; per-pensioner drill-down.
- **Edge Cases:** Pensioner whose restoration/age-increment coincides; partial-month effective date; pensioner deceased between compute and apply; pay-commission notional fixation anomaly; DA negative revision.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RevisionEngine`, `ArrearCalculator`, `BatchApprover`, scheduler for age increments |

### FR-M11-14 — Treasury / Bank / PDA Integration

- **Module:** M11-F14
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (prepare), Sanctioning Authority (authorise), Treasury/PDA/Bank
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to transmit authorised pension and terminal-benefit payment instructions to the disbursing authority and reconcile acknowledgements so that pensioners are actually paid and exceptions are caught.
- **Description:** Produce disbursement instruction batches for first pension, monthly pension, arrears, gratuity, commuted value, GPF, and terminal benefits; transfer PPO authorisation to the Pension Disbursing Authority/treasury/bank in the agreed format; track transmission and acknowledgement; and reconcile paid/failed lines back to cases and pensioners, raising exceptions for failures.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Only AUTHORISED instructions (SoD: authoriser ≠ preparer) are transmitted.
  - AC2: Each disbursement line ties to a PPO/pensioner/case and an amount; batch totals reconcile to the sum of lines.
  - AC3: Acknowledgements update `instruction_status` (ACKNOWLEDGED/PARTIALLY_ACK/FAILED) and failed lines raise exceptions/grievances.
  - AC4: First pension instruction is generated to commence on the pension start date (no break).
  - AC5: Idempotent transmission prevents duplicate payments.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Invalid/missing bank or PDA binding blocks the line. BR2: Failed lines are retried or re-routed, never silently abandoned. BR3: Monthly pension respects LC suspension (held lines excluded).
- **Data Model References:** `pension_disbursements`, `ppo_records`, `pensioners`, `terminal_settlements`, `pension_revisions` (arrears).

### FR-M11-15 — Retirement Self-Service Portal & Benefit Estimators / What-If

- **Module:** M11-F15
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee / Retiring Employee, Pensioner (self-service)
- **User Story:** As a retiring employee, I want to see my retirement timeline, estimate my benefits under different scenarios, and submit my pension forms online so that I can plan and act without visiting an office.
- **Description:** Provide a self-service portal where employees view their projected retirement date and case status, run **benefit estimators / what-if** (vary assumed emoluments, commutation fraction, retirement date) producing indicative (non-binding) basic pension, commuted value, gratuity, and leave encashment, submit pension options (commutation choice, nominee details, bank details) into the case, upload documents, and track each processing stage. Pensioners reuse the portal for e-PPO, LC, and grievances.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Estimators clearly label results as indicative/non-binding (`is_binding=false`) and never write to the live case.
  - AC2: What-if scenarios can vary commutation fraction, emoluments, and date, recomputing all four headline figures.
  - AC3: Submitted options (commutation, nominee, bank) flow into the case via maker-checker, not directly into sanctioned data.
  - AC4: The employee sees a real-time stage tracker mirroring the case state machine.
  - AC5: All self-service screens cover empty/loading/error/success/permission states (no skeleton placeholders).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Estimators use current rule tables but flag that final figures depend on verified service and emoluments. BR2: Self-service writes require the employee's identity/MFA and route to Pension Officer review.
- **Data Model References:** `benefit_estimates`, `separation_cases` (status read; option submissions), `nominees_beneficiaries`, `retirement_forecasts` (read).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

### FR-M11-16 — Pensioner Grievance Management

- **Module:** M11-F16
- **Primary Role(s):** Pensioner / Family Pensioner, Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a pensioner, I want to raise and track grievances about my pension so that issues like non-receipt, wrong amount, or unapplied revision are resolved within an SLA.
- **Description:** Provide grievance intake (categorised), routing to the responsible Pension Officer, SLA tracking with escalation, linkage to the underlying case/PPO/disbursement, and resolution with audit. Auto-creates grievances from disbursement failures (FR-14) and surfaces ageing and SLA-breach analytics.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A grievance captures category, description, priority, and links to pensioner/case where known.
  - AC2: SLA due date is set by category/priority; breach escalates to the Sanctioning Authority.
  - AC3: Disbursement failures auto-create a grievance linked to the failed line.
  - AC4: Resolution requires a recorded action and notifies the pensioner; reopen is supported.
  - AC5: Grievance status follows the state machine with full audit.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: SLA matrix configurable by category/priority. BR2: Critical grievances (payment-not-received) auto-prioritise. BR3: Closure requires resolution text.
- **Data Model References:** `pension_grievances`, `pensioners`, `separation_cases`, `pension_disbursements` (link).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/grievances` | raise grievance |

### FR-M11-17 — Forecasting & Pension-Liability Analytics

- **Module:** M11-F17
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Department Head, Auditor
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want pension-liability and processing analytics so that I can plan budgets, staffing, and SLA compliance.
- **Description:** Provide analytics over the retirement pipeline and pensioner population: due-for-retirement workload by horizon/org/cadre, projected pension-liability (current and future, factoring DA/pay-commission scenarios), benefit-cost breakdown (pension/gratuity/commutation/family pension), processing SLA and ageing (case stage durations, first-pension-on-time rate), and grievance trends. Read-only aggregations sourced from M11 entities; feeds M14.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Liability projection aggregates `pensioners.current_monthly_pension` × 12 plus pipeline cases, with scenario sliders for DA/pay-commission.
  - AC2: Workload analytics show counts by horizon bucket, org unit, and cadre.
  - AC3: SLA analytics compute first-pension-on-time rate and average stage durations.
  - AC4: All analytics respect org-unit row-level scope; export honours permissions.
  - AC5: Figures reconcile to underlying records (no fabricated aggregates).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Analytics are read-only and never mutate cases/pensioners. BR2: Scenario projections are clearly labelled assumptions. BR3: Auditor sees all; managers see own scope.
- **Data Model References:** `retirement_forecasts`, `pensioners`, `separation_cases`, `pension_calculations`, `gratuity_calculations`, `family_pension_records`, `pension_grievances` (all read).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data Migration

- Migrate the existing pensioner population: pensioner master, current pension, PPO numbers, PDA bindings, bank details (encrypted), LC status, and commutation/restoration schedules.
- Migrate in-flight separation cases at their current stage with verified service and computed benefits where available.
- Map legacy separation types, schemes (OPS/NPS), and rule versions; load effective-dated rule tables (DA, commutation factors, family-pension rates, gratuity ceilings, retirement ages).
- Load nominee/beneficiary registers and family-pension hierarchies for active family pensioners.

### 13.2 Validation & Parallel Run

- Recompute a statistically significant sample of legacy pensions/gratuities and reconcile to legacy figures within tolerance; investigate variances.
- Run a parallel DA revision against legacy output and tie out per-pensioner deltas.
- Validate PPO-number uniqueness and PDA bindings; dry-run a disbursement batch in a sandbox PDA channel.

### 13.3 Cutover & Launch

- Freeze legacy writes; final delta migration; switch disbursement instructions to M11; verify first post-cutover monthly disbursement end-to-end with PDA acknowledgement.
- Enable pensioner self-service (e-PPO, LC, grievance) after data validation.

### 13.4 Launch Readiness Checklist

| Item | Gate |
|---|---|
| Rule tables loaded & approved (DA, factors, rates, ceilings, ages) | required |
| Pensioner master reconciled to legacy counts & sums | required |
| Sample benefit recomputation within tolerance | required |
| PPO-number registry continuity verified | required |
| Disbursement sandbox tie-out with PDA | required |
| SoD roles & approvals configured | required |
| DLC/Jeevan Pramaan integration tested with fallback | required |
| Audit log & immutability verified | required |

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Benefit Computation Order (default sequence)

1. Verify gap-free service (M12) → 2. Compute qualifying service (deduct non-qualifying spells, round half-years) → 3. Resolve emoluments base (M10; last-drawn vs 10-month average, beneficial) → 4. Basic pension (OPS) / NPS handling → 5. Commutation (option, factor, value, residual, restoration schedule) → 6. Gratuity (retirement/death, slab, ceiling) → 7. Family pension (where applicable; normal/enhanced) → 8. Leave encashment (M03) → 9. GPF final → 10. Net recoveries within protection → 11. Sanction → 12. PPO issue → 13. Disbursement & pensioner enrolment.

### 16.2 Rounding & Money Rules

- All amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)`; factors/rates `NUMERIC(9,4)`; service in integer Y/M/D; no floating point.
- Benefit rounding per `rule_version_ref` (default: round to the next higher rupee where rules so prescribe).
- Half-year rounding for qualifying service per the configured rule (e.g., ≥3 months = one half-year).

### 16.3 Recovery Priority & Net Protection

Statutory dues → court attachment → disciplinary recovery (M09) → enterprise over-payment → outstanding loans/advances (M10) → other. If recoveries would breach the protected floor, lower-priority recoveries are deferred and flagged (`RECOVERY_EXCEEDS_PROTECTION`); spillover may be recovered from future pension where rules allow.

### 16.4 Immutability & Correction Policy

A SANCTIONED calculation, an ISSUED/ACTIVE PPO, and an APPLIED revision are immutable. Corrections never edit the original; they are issued as: (a) a SUPERSEDING calculation/REVISED PPO (linked via `supersedes_ppo_id`), (b) a new revision batch, or (c) a recovery/arrear. Anticipatory PPOs are always superseded by the final PPO with adjustment. Each correction references the original for traceability.

### 16.5 OPS vs NPS Handling

- Scheme is derived from `employees.date_of_joining` versus the configured cutover; recorded contribution history corroborates; override requires reason + audit.
- OPS: M11 computes defined-benefit pension, commutation, gratuity, family pension, and GPF.
- NPS: M11 records corpus/PRAN, produces indicative annuity/withdrawal figures, routes to the NPS/CRA exit and annuity service, and computes any NPS-specific additional relief/family benefit per rule; GPF is not applicable.

### 16.6 Assumptions Log

- Single legal entity per deployment (data model entity-aware for future multi-entity).
- Pension/commutation/gratuity/family-pension/DA/ceiling/retirement-age parameters are effective-dated master data entered by SysAdmin and approved.
- PDA/treasury/bank supports a documented file/API format; format is pluggable.
- Jeevan Pramaan/DLC integration is available with physical/video-KYC fallback.
- Emoluments method and reckonable period are configurable policy parameters resolved and snapshotted per case.
