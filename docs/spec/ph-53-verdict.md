# PH-53 (Remediation Tranche 40) — Human-Gate Verdict

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Chains from:** `docs/spec/ph-52-verdict.md` (tranche 39)
**Baseline:** `docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md`
**Branch:** ph02-rerun (merged to main per sub-phase)

## Suite evidence (oracle-recomputed)

- API `npm test`: **542 pass**, 0 fail, 1 skipped (DATABASE_URL-gated PH-06 persistence test).
- Web `npm run web:test`: **133 pass**, 0 fail.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run web:typecheck`: green.

The PH-53A oracle (and the PH-37A gate at its raised floor) were run **externally** by the driver and are
GREEN. Sixteenth tranche of the user-directed "raise contract coverage" workstream, moving into PS09. Built
by hand — subagents credit-exhausted until 2026-07-08.

> **GREEN here is necessary, not sufficient.** Human review required before advancing.

## What tranche 40 closed — coverage ratcheted further with real, tested routes

| Module | Route exposure | Backing | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PS09** | suspension review (`POST /disciplinary/suspensions/{id}:review`), show-cause response (`:respond`), consultation close/waive (`/disciplinary/consultations/{id}:close`, `:waive`), personal-hearing minutes (`/disciplinary/personal-hearings/{id}:minutes`), and case reads (`GET .../case-timeline`, `/icc-appointments`, `/personal-hearings`, `GET /disciplinary/penalty-orders/{id}`) | existing `disciplinaryService` (NOT_FOUND fail-closed on unknown subjects), service-tested | `ph53a-ps09-disciplinary-route.test.cjs` |

Real behavioral routes over already-tested backing — **not** scaffolding. Measured contract coverage ratchets
**495 / 37.4% → 504 / 38.1%** (PS09 **28.1% → 38.2%**), and the PH-37 gate floor was raised in lockstep so the
gain is locked. The PH-04D route-metadata invariant (a GET path ending `/timeline` must be paginated) was
honoured by naming the array read `/case-timeline` — the global check was respected, not weakened.

**Milestone:** with PS09 raised, **every G-module (PS01–PS14) has now been advanced above its baseline coverage**
this workstream — the "lowest-coverage module" leapfrog pass is complete.

## Remaining gaps (still open — this is NOT a 100% claim)

- **Contract coverage is 38.1%** — ~819 of the **1,323** contracted operations remain unimplemented. The
  coverage tool is still **count-based**, not per-operation path matching. The workstream continues by
  going **deeper into every module** (each still has unexposed backing: jurisdiction, revisions, disbursement
  batches, mapping adjudication, etc.), plus the untouched **PS05** deeper surface.
- **Persistence workstream:** the hand-built services (PH-16F..PH-53 engines) use in-memory repositories;
  Postgres-backed repos + migrations remain deferred; the `ph06-persistence` migration list froze at 0008.

**Contract-op caveat (quantified):** the OpenAPI contract enumerates **1,323** operations; **504** are
implemented as behavioral kernel routes (**38.1%**).

## Recommendation for the human reviewer

Approve PH-53B, OR direct a further tranche (PH-54). The active workstream (per your steer) is raising
measured coverage by exposing real, tested backing, with the ratchet gate proving each gain and forbidding
regression; the first pass across all modules is complete, and further tranches go deeper into each. The
standing **persistence migration workstream** remains the alternative. Carried debt is unchanged: in-memory
repositories for the newest services.
