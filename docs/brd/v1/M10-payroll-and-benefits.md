## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Payroll and Benefits Management module (**M10-PAY**) is the financial heart of the HRMS. It computes, controls, and disburses employee compensation each pay cycle; administers statutory deductions, loans, advances, and benefits; and produces every downstream financial and compliance artefact (payslips, bank disbursement files, statutory remittance schedules, Form-16/tax statements, payroll registers, and cost-to-organisation analytics). It also publishes pay events to the **Digital Service Register (M12)** and feeds terminal-benefit and pension processing in **M11**.

M10 is engineered as a **configurable, rule-driven, audit-grade payroll engine**. Pay is never hand-keyed into a ledger; it is *derived* from a versioned salary structure, time/leave inputs (M03), service events (promotions/pay-fixation from M06, disciplinary recoveries from M09), and a deterministic computation pipeline. Once a payroll run is **finalised and locked, it is immutable** — corrections flow only through arrears, supplementary, or off-cycle runs, never through silent edits. Every rupee is traceable from input to disbursement and reversible only through a controlled adjustment with full audit.

### 1.2 Business Context and Problem Statement

Enterprise payroll combines high volume with extreme regulatory sensitivity: pay matrices and scales (e.g., 7th CPC-style pay levels), Dearness Allowance (DA) revisions issued retrospectively, House Rent Allowance (HRA) by city class, GPF/CPF/NPS contributions, income-tax (TDS) with employee declarations and proofs, professional tax slabs by state, recoveries ordered by disciplinary authorities, and statutory remittances under tight deadlines. Manual or spreadsheet-driven payroll produces reconciliation gaps, over/under-payments, audit findings, and litigation. M10 eliminates these by making the rule set explicit and versioned, the run reproducible, and the controls enforceable.

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives

| # | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Deterministic, reproducible monthly payroll | Re-running an unlocked cycle with identical inputs yields byte-identical results |
| G2 | Statutory accuracy | 100% correct DA/HRA/PT/TDS/GPF/NPS computation against published rules; zero statutory-deadline misses |
| G3 | Immutable, auditable finalised runs | No mutation of locked runs; every adjustment traceable to an arrear/supplementary/off-cycle entry |
| G4 | Reconciliation integrity | Gross = sum(earnings); Net = Gross − sum(deductions); Bank file total = sum(net pay) — reconciled before disbursement |
| G5 | Self-service | Employees access payslips, tax declarations, Form-16, loan statements without HR intervention |
| G6 | Retrospective correctness | Arrears for back-dated DA/increment/pay-fixation computed automatically with full break-up |
| G7 | Cost transparency | Cost-to-organisation analytics by org unit, cadre, component, and period |

### 1.4 Scope Summary

In scope: salary structure & pay rules engine; monthly payroll run engine with parallel/what-if runs; arrears & retrospective revisions; supplementary & off-cycle payroll; LWP/leave-based deductions; statutory deductions (TDS, PT, GPF/PF, NPS, pension contribution, insurance); recoveries; loans & advances; benefits administration (medical, LTC/LTA, gratuity accrual, reimbursements, group insurance); payslip generation; bank disbursement file & integration; payroll register & reconciliation; Form-16/tax statements; approval & locking; feeds to M11 and M12.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): the canonical employee master (M01), attendance/leave capture (M03), pension disbursement after retirement (M11), the SR ledger itself (M12), document storage internals (M13), and general-ledger / accounting postings beyond producing the payroll cost journal export.

### 1.5 Key Stakeholders

Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager/Controller, HR Officer/Admin, Department Head/Drawing & Disbursing Officer (DDO), Finance/Treasury, Employee (self-service), Auditor, System Administrator.

### 1.6 Success Criteria

A pay cycle is "successful" when: all eligible active employees are computed; reconciliation balances to zero variance; the run is approved and locked; payslips are published; the bank file is generated, signed, and accepted; statutory schedules are produced; and pay events are posted to M12 — all within the cycle calendar with a complete audit trail.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from Shared Foundation)

All M10 features inherit: UUID PKs + human business keys; standard audit fields; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE status enums; UTC storage / locale display; `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates; INR default currency with i18n money formatting; paginated list endpoints (max page 100); maker-checker via the shared workflow engine; RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; immutable `audit_log` write on every state change; `documents` (M13) for generated artefacts; `notifications` for events; `service_register_events` (M12) for pay events.

### 2.3 In-Scope / Out-of-Scope Boundary Table

| Concern | In M10? | Owner / Note |
|---|---|---|
| Employee master data | Reference only | M01 (golden source) |
| Attendance & leave balances | Consume only | M03 (LWP days, paid/unpaid splits) |
| Promotion / pay-fixation order | Consume the order; compute pay impact | M06 issues; M10 fixes pay & computes arrears |
| Disciplinary recovery order | Consume; recover via payroll | M09 issues; M10 schedules recovery |
| Pension disbursement | Out | M11 (M10 supplies last-pay-drawn & contribution history) |
| Service register pay events | Write events | M12 owns ledger; M10 appends |
| Document storage | Reference | M13 stores payslips/Form-16 objects |
| General ledger posting | Export only | M10 produces cost journal; Finance posts in ERP/treasury |
| Bank core integration | File + API handshake | Treasury/Bank gateway is external |

### 2.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- Pay scales, DA rates, HRA city classes, PT slabs, and tax slabs are **configurable master data**, sourced from enterprise notifications and version-effective-dated.
- A single legal entity per deployment; multi-entity is a future extension but the data model is entity-aware (`legal_entity_id`).
- One primary monthly cycle plus arrears/supplementary/off-cycle cycles per period.
- The bank/treasury accepts a defined fixed-width or NACH/structured file format; M10 is format-pluggable.
- All money math uses fixed-point decimal (no binary float); rounding rules are explicit and configurable (default: round to nearest rupee, half-up; statutory deductions per their own rounding rules).

## 4. Shared Application Foundation

M10 inherits the Shared Foundation §5 technical defaults verbatim: React + TypeScript (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) frontend; REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL primary store; encrypted object storage for payslips/Form-16; OIDC/SSO + MFA; JWT + RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; canonical error envelope; OWASP ASVS; TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest; DPDP Act 2023 alignment; P95 < 500ms (interactive), batch SLAs defined in §10; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h.

**M10-specific foundation extensions:**

- **Money type:** `NUMERIC(15,2)` fixed-point for all amounts; rates as `NUMERIC(9,4)`; no floating point in computation.
- **Computation determinism:** the run engine is a pure function of (salary structure version, rate tables effective on pay period, employee inputs, prior balances). Same inputs → same outputs.
- **Immutability:** finalised payroll runs and their payslips are append-only snapshots; corrections create new artefacts.
- **Idempotency:** all run/disbursement mutating endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key` header.
- **Transactionality:** a payroll run commits as an all-or-nothing transaction per run; partial computation is held in a staging area until validated.
- **Encryption:** bank account numbers, PAN, and salary amounts are PII/financial data — encrypted at rest, masked in UI by default, access logged.

### 5.6 Data Integrity Rules

1. **Earning/deduction identity:** for each payslip, `gross_earnings = Σ(lines where type=EARNING)`, `total_deductions = Σ(lines where type=DEDUCTION)`, `net_pay = gross_earnings − total_deductions`, and `net_pay ≥ 0` (a fully-recovered employee cannot have negative net; excess recovery rolls forward).
2. **Run totals:** `payroll_runs.gross_total/deduction_total/net_total` equal the sums of their payslips; enforced at commit.
3. **Reconciliation gate:** a run cannot move to APPROVED unless a `payroll_reconciliations` row exists with `signoff_status=SIGNED_OFF` and zero unexplained variance.
4. **Bank file integrity:** `bank_disbursements.total_amount = Σ payslip.net_pay (status=FINAL)` for the run, and `record_count = count(payslips with net_pay>0)`.
5. **Immutability:** when `payroll_runs.status=LOCKED`, all child payslips/lines are read-only (`is_immutable=true`); any change requires a new arrear/supplementary/off-cycle run.
6. **Effective-dating:** only one ACTIVE `employee_salary_structures` version per employee per date; overlapping effective ranges are rejected.
7. **Statutory caps:** GPF/NPS/gratuity/PT respect configured caps; computed amounts cannot exceed statutory ceilings.
8. **Loan ledger:** `Σ loan_repayments.principal_component = loans_advances.principal` at CLOSED; `outstanding_principal` is monotonically non-increasing.
9. **Tax YTD:** `deductions.cumulative_ytd` for TDS reconciles to Form-24Q quarterly totals.
10. **SoD:** `payroll_runs.approved_by ≠ created_by`; `bank_disbursements.signed_by ≠ run creator`.
11. **One structure snapshot per payslip:** `payslips.structure_version_ref` must point to the structure version effective on the cycle period.
12. **FK integrity & soft delete:** an employee with any non-CLOSED loan, active deduction, or unsettled gratuity cannot be hard-deleted; soft delete only.

### FR-M10-01 — Pay Component & Rules Engine Configuration

- **Module:** M10-F01 / M10-F02
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (config), Payroll Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to define earning/deduction components and their versioned computation rules so that payroll math is configurable without code changes and fully auditable.
- **Description:** Maintain the `pay_components` catalog and `pay_rules` (formula DSL, calc method, eligibility, rounding, computation order, effective dates). Rules are versioned; activating a new version retires the prior version's effective range. A safe expression evaluator (whitelisted operators/functions, references to component codes and employee attributes) computes values; arbitrary code execution is prohibited.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A component can be created with type, category, calc method, taxable flag, and display order.
  - AC2: A rule version with an invalid expression (unknown reference, unbalanced parentheses, disallowed token) is rejected with a precise error and line/column.
  - AC3: Activating a rule version sets `effective_to` on the prior ACTIVE version to one day before the new `effective_from`; no two ACTIVE versions overlap.
  - AC4: Computation order is unique within an effective window; duplicate orders rejected.
  - AC5: All changes require Payroll Manager approval (maker-checker) before becoming ACTIVE.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: A component referenced by any active employee structure cannot be deleted; it can only be deactivated.
  - BR2: DEDUCTION components flagged `is_statutory=true` cannot be overridden to a lower amount than the statutory computation by a Payroll Officer.
  - BR3: Formula references are resolved in `computation_order`; forward references to not-yet-computed components are rejected.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `pay_components` | CRUD component catalog |
| `pay_rules` | versioned rule definitions |
| `rate_tables` | referenced by SLAB/PERCENT rules |
| `audit_log` | record every config change |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/components` | create component |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/components/{id}/rules` | add rule version |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/rules/{id}:activate` | activate (checker) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/components` | list (paginated) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Rule editor with live syntax validation, a "test against sample employee" panel showing the evaluated trace, and a version timeline. Activation button disabled for makers.
- **Edge Cases:** Circular references between component formulae; activating a rule whose `rate_table` has no effective row for the period; deactivating a component mid-financial-year.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RuleConfigController`, `ExpressionParser`, `RuleVersionService`, `ComponentRepository` |
| Backend Flow | Validate payload → parse expression to AST (whitelist) → static-check references & order → persist DRAFT → on activate, run SoD + checker check, close prior version, set ACTIVE in a transaction |
| Data Operations | INSERT component/rule; UPDATE prior rule `effective_to`; transactional |
| Validation | Whitelisted token set; reference existence; order uniqueness; effective-range non-overlap |
| Authorization | SysAdmin create; Payroll Manager activate; Auditor read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | rule.status DRAFT→ACTIVE; prior ACTIVE→RETIRED; audit_log entry; cache invalidation of rule set |
| Failure Handling | Parse error → 400 `RULE_EXPRESSION_INVALID`; overlap → 409 `RULE_VERSION_OVERLAP` |
| Dependencies | rate_tables (FR-02), workflow engine |
| Test Guidance | Unit-test parser with malicious/edge expressions; verify non-overlap invariant; SoD enforcement test |

### FR-M10-02 — Pay Scale / Matrix & Statutory Rate Table Management

- **Module:** M10-F01
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator, Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As an Administrator, I want to maintain pay-matrix levels and effective-dated statutory rate tables (DA%, HRA class %, PT slabs, tax slabs, GPF/NPS rates) so that revisions issued by enterprise notifications apply automatically from their effective date.
- **Description:** CRUD for `pay_matrix_levels` and `rate_tables`, all effective-dated. A DA revision is entered once and automatically applies to every eligible employee from `effective_from` (including retrospectively, triggering arrears via FR-10).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A new DA rate with a past `effective_from` is accepted and flagged as "retrospective — will generate arrears".
  - AC2: Two overlapping effective rows for the same `table_type/key/regime/FY` are rejected.
  - AC3: Tax slabs require a `regime` and `financial_year`; PT slabs require slab_min/slab_max.
  - AC4: Changes are versioned and audited; no in-place edit of a row already used in a LOCKED run (a new effective row is created instead).
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: HRA class % keyed by `city_class` (X/Y/Z).
  - BR2: A rate row used by any locked payslip is immutable; corrections are new effective rows.
  - BR3: Effective dates align to the 1st of a month unless an explicit mid-month proration policy is enabled.
- **Data Model References:** `rate_tables`, `pay_matrix_levels`, `pay_scales` (ref), `arrears` (downstream), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/rate-tables` | add effective-dated rate |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/rate-tables?type=DA_RATE&date=` | resolve rate as-of |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/pay-matrix` | add matrix level/cell |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Effective-dated grid with "as-of date" selector; retrospective-entry warning banner; side-by-side compare of old vs new rate.
- **Edge Cases:** DA increase notified after the cycle is locked → arrears in next cycle; pay-matrix cell deletion when referenced by a structure; mid-month DA effective date.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RateTableController`, `EffectiveDateResolver`, `PayMatrixService` |
| Backend Flow | Validate effective range → check non-overlap → persist → if `effective_from` < current open cycle start, enqueue arrears candidate scan |
| Data Operations | INSERT rate row; never UPDATE locked-referenced rows |
| Validation | Non-overlap; required fields by table_type; immutability check against locked runs |
| Authorization | SysAdmin write; Payroll Mgr approve; Auditor read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | New rate active; arrears scan job enqueued; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Overlap → 409 `RATE_OVERLAP`; locked-ref edit → 409 `RATE_LOCKED_IMMUTABLE` |
| Dependencies | FR-10 arrears engine |
| Test Guidance | Resolver returns correct rate for boundary dates; retrospective entry triggers arrears candidate |

### FR-M10-03 — Employee Salary Structure Assignment & Versioning

- **Module:** M10-F03
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (maker), Payroll Manager (checker), HR Admin (request)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to assign and version each employee's salary structure (pay level, city class, component set, overrides) so that pay is derived correctly and every change is effective-dated and auditable.
- **Description:** Bind an employee to a `pay_matrix_level` and component set, producing `employee_salary_structures` + `employee_salary_components`. Each change (increment, revision, override) creates a new version; the prior version is SUPERSEDED. Overrides require a reason.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Creating a new version supersedes the prior ACTIVE version with contiguous effective ranges (no gap/overlap).
  - AC2: A FIXED_OVERRIDE component requires `override_amount` and `override_reason`.
  - AC3: Structure changes route through maker-checker before becoming ACTIVE.
  - AC4: A change with `effective_from` in a LOCKED period is rejected — it must be handled as an arrear (FR-10).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Exactly one ACTIVE version per employee at any date. BR2: City class drives HRA. BR3: Statutory deduction components are auto-attached based on employee scheme (GPF vs NPS per joining date).
- **Data Model References:** `employee_salary_structures`, `employee_salary_components`, `pay_matrix_levels`, `pay_components`, `deductions`, `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/structures` | create new version |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/structures` | version history |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/structures/{id}:approve` | checker approve |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Structure builder showing auto-resolved components vs overrides; effective-date timeline; diff of versions; HRA auto-updates when city class changes.
- **Edge Cases:** Employee on GPF vs NPS based on DOJ cutoff; mid-month transfer changing city class; override exceeding sanity bounds.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `StructureController`, `StructureVersionService`, `SchemeResolver` |
| Backend Flow | Build component set from rules + scheme → apply overrides → validate → create version → close prior → maker-checker → ACTIVE |
| Data Operations | INSERT structure + components; UPDATE prior `effective_to`/status; transactional |
| Validation | Contiguity; override reason; locked-period guard; scheme correctness |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer create; Payroll Mgr approve |
| State Changes & Side Effects | new ACTIVE version; SR-relevant pay change may emit M12 event on finalisation; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Locked period → 409 `STRUCTURE_PERIOD_LOCKED`; overlap → 409 `STRUCTURE_OVERLAP` |
| Dependencies | FR-01/02, M06 (pay-fixation source), FR-10 |
| Test Guidance | Version contiguity invariant; GPF/NPS scheme selection by DOJ; override audit |

### FR-M10-04 — Monthly Payroll Run Engine

- **Module:** M10-F04
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (run), Payroll Manager (oversee)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to execute the monthly payroll run that computes every eligible employee's pay deterministically so that gross, deductions, and net are derived from versioned rules and current inputs.
- **Description:** Orchestrates the cycle: freeze inputs at cutoff, gather structure snapshots + leave/LWP (FR-05) + statutory deductions (FR-06) + loan recoveries (FR-08) + arrears (FR-10), evaluate rules in computation order, persist `payslips` + `payslip_lines` with full `calc_trace`. Runs in a staging area first; the run is a single atomic commit. Supports DRAFT and FINAL modes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A draft run produces per-employee results with full computation trace and a list of failures (no partial commit on failure).
  - AC2: Re-running the same cycle with unchanged inputs yields identical results (determinism).
  - AC3: Employees with computation errors are isolated; the run reports them without aborting valid computations into a quarantine list.
  - AC4: `net_pay ≥ 0`; excess recovery rolls forward and is flagged.
  - AC5: Run totals equal the sum of payslips at commit.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Only ACTIVE employees in scope on the pay date are included (joiners/leavers prorated). BR2: A FINAL run requires the cycle to be INPUT_LOCKED. BR3: Computation uses rate tables effective on the period, not "today".
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_cycles`, `payroll_runs`, `payslips`, `payslip_lines`, `employee_salary_structures`, `deductions`, `loans_advances`, `arrears`, `rate_tables`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/runs` | start a run (mode in body) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}` | run status & totals |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/exceptions` | per-employee failures |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:cancel` | cancel draft |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Run console with progress (computed/total), live totals, exception drill-down, and a per-employee trace viewer. FINAL run gated behind reconciliation.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-month joiner/leaver proration; suspended employee (subsistence allowance only); employee with missing structure; division-by-zero in a formula; very large cohort batch.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RunOrchestrator`, `ComputationEngine`, `InputAggregator`, `StagingRepository`, async worker/queue |
| Backend Flow | Lock inputs → snapshot structures → aggregate inputs → for each employee compute components in order into staging → validate totals/identities → atomic commit payslips+lines+run totals |
| Data Operations | Bulk INSERT into staging; transactional move to `payslips`/`payslip_lines`; UPDATE run totals |
| Validation | Identity equations; net≥0; scope eligibility; rate resolution success |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer (own org scope); Manager read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | run.status QUEUED→RUNNING→COMPLETED/FAILED; cycle OPEN→COMPUTING→COMPUTED; audit_log; notifications on completion |

### FR-M10-05 — Attendance & Leave (LWP) Input Integration

- **Module:** M10-F05
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to ingest paid/unpaid day counts and Leave-Without-Pay (LWP) from M03 so that loss-of-pay deductions are computed accurately for the period.
- **Description:** Pull approved attendance/leave for the cycle from M03 (paid days, LWP days, half-days, unauthorised absence). Compute LWP loss-of-pay (per-day rate = monthly pay / days-in-month or /30 per policy). Inputs freeze at cutoff; late changes route to arrears.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: LWP days reduce pay using the configured per-day basis; the reduction shows as a payslip line.
  - AC2: Paid_days + lwp_days reconcile to the period's calendar days for full-month employees.
  - AC3: Attendance received after cutoff is excluded and queued for arrears/recovery.
  - AC4: Unauthorised absence beyond a threshold flags an exception (link to M09 if dies-non).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Per-day basis configurable (actual days vs 30-day). BR2: Half-pay leave reduces eligible components per policy. BR3: Joiner/leaver proration uses actual paid days.
- **Data Model References:** `payslips` (paid_days/lwp_days), `payslip_lines` (LWP line), M03 attendance (read), `arrears` (late inputs).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/attendance-inputs` | fetched M03 inputs |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/attendance-inputs:refresh` | re-pull before cutoff |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Attendance input grid (employee × paid/LWP/half), exceptions highlighted, "refresh from M03" with cutoff lock indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Retrospective leave regularisation post-lock; dies-non (no pay, no service) vs LWP; overlapping leave records; leave encashment interplay.

### FR-M10-06 — Statutory Deductions Computation (GPF/PF, NPS, PT, Pension, Insurance)

- **Module:** M10-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want statutory deductions computed automatically per scheme and slab so that GPF/PF, NPS, professional tax, pension contribution, and insurance are accurate and remittable.
- **Description:** For each employee, compute scheme-based deductions: GPF/CPF (% of basic, with voluntary top-up), NPS (employee 10% + employer 14% of basic+DA), professional tax (state slab), pension/insurance contributions, court attachments. YTD cumulatives maintained for reconciliation and remittance schedules (FR-17).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: NPS computes both employee and employer contributions; both appear (employer as info/cost line).
  - AC2: PT applies the correct state slab for the employee's gross within the month.
  - AC3: Statutory caps are enforced (e.g., GPF subscription limits).
  - AC4: `cumulative_ytd` increments correctly and survives re-runs idempotently.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: GPF for pre-cutoff joiners; NPS for post-cutoff joiners (scheme by DOJ). BR2: Court-attachment deductions take legal priority within net-pay protection limits. BR3: Employer NPS/pension contributions are costs, not employee deductions.
- **Data Model References:** `deductions`, `rate_tables` (PT/NPS/GPF), `payslip_lines`, `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/deductions` | list deductions |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/employees/{id}/deductions` | add voluntary/manual deduction |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/statutory-summary` | run-level statutory totals |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Deduction panel per employee showing scheme, rate, YTD; voluntary GPF top-up entry; employer-contribution info card.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year scheme migration; PT slab boundary; court attachment exceeding protected net; NPS for employee crossing basic+DA threshold.
- **LLD:**

### FR-M10-07 — Income-Tax (TDS) Declarations, Proofs & Computation

- **Module:** M10-F07 / M10-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (declare), Payroll Officer (verify), Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to declare investments and choose a tax regime, upload proofs, and see my projected tax so that TDS is deducted accurately across the financial year.
- **Description:** Employees submit `tax_declarations` (regime, 80C/80D/HRA/home-loan items), upload proofs (M13), and the system projects annual taxable income and tax, spreading TDS across remaining months. Payroll verifies proofs after the proof cutoff; unverified declarations revert to a conservative computation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Switching regime recomputes projected tax and per-month TDS.
  - AC2: After proof cutoff, unverified declared deductions are excluded and TDS recomputed.
  - AC3: Declaration locks after FY proof cutoff (`lock_after_cutoff`).
  - AC4: Projected tax updates when salary/arrears change.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: New regime ignores most exemptions per statute. BR2: TDS = (projected annual tax − YTD TDS) / remaining months. BR3: Proof verification is maker-checker; partial verification reduces allowed amount.
- **Data Model References:** `tax_declarations`, `documents` (proofs), `deductions` (TDS), `rate_tables` (TAX_SLAB), `payslip_lines`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/tax-declarations` | submit/update (self) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/tax-declarations/{id}/proofs` | upload proof |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/tax-declarations/{id}:verify` | verify (Payroll) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/tax-declarations/{id}/projection` | projected tax |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Regime comparison wizard (old vs new side-by-side), declaration form with section limits, proof upload, projected-tax breakdown, cutoff countdown.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year regime change restrictions; proof partially accepted; arrears spiking taxable income; employee leaving mid-year (final TDS settlement).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `TaxDeclarationController`, `TaxProjectionEngine`, `RegimeComparator`, document client (M13) |
| Backend Flow | Capture declaration → project annual income (incl. arrears) → apply regime rules & slabs → derive monthly TDS → on verify, finalise allowed amounts |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE declaration; link proof doc ids; update TDS deduction |
| Validation | Section caps; regime rules; cutoff lock; proof presence |
| Authorization | Employee self; Payroll verify; Auditor read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | verification_status transitions; TDS recompute; notification on verify/reject |
| Failure Handling | Slab missing → `TAX_SLAB_NOT_FOUND`; over-declaration → clamp to cap |

### FR-M10-08 — Loans & Advances Management

- **Module:** M10-F08
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), DDO/Dept Head (sanction), Payroll Officer (schedule/recover)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to apply for loans/advances and have installments recovered automatically through payroll so that repayment is accurate, with interest, and I can foreclose when I choose.
- **Description:** Lifecycle for HBA/vehicle/computer/festival/GPF/salary advances: request → sanction → disburse → installment recovery (principal + interest) via payroll → foreclosure/closure. Maintains `loans_advances` + `loan_repayments` ledger; supports reducing/simple interest, holds (no-recovery months), and foreclosure with interest settlement.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: On each run, the scheduled installment is recovered and the ledger updated (outstanding decreases).
  - AC2: Final installment closes the loan; `Σ principal_components = principal`.
  - AC3: Foreclosure computes outstanding principal + accrued interest and settles in one entry.
  - AC4: If net pay is insufficient, recovery is partial/skipped per policy and flagged.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Total deductions cannot push net below protected minimum; loan recovery yields after statutory. BR2: Interest method fixed at sanction. BR3: A loan on hold skips recovery without penalty unless policy charges interest.
- **Data Model References:** `loans_advances`, `loan_repayments`, `payslip_lines` (recovery line), `audit_log`, workflow (sanction).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/loans` | apply |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/loans/{id}:sanction` | DDO sanction |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/loans/{id}:foreclose` | foreclosure |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/loans/{id}/schedule` | amortization schedule |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Loan application wizard with eligibility check; amortization preview; employee self-service statement; foreclosure calculator.
- **Edge Cases:** Insufficient net pay; loan during LWP months; transfer mid-recovery; outstanding loan at retirement (settle from terminal benefits via M11).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `LoanController`, `AmortizationService`, `RecoveryScheduler` |
| Backend Flow | Sanction → generate schedule → each run pull due installment → compute principal/interest split → recover (subject to net protection) → update ledger |
| Data Operations | INSERT loan + schedule; per-run INSERT loan_repayment; UPDATE outstanding |
| Validation | Net-protection; schedule integrity; foreclosure math |
| Authorization | Employee request; DDO sanction; Payroll recover |
| State Changes & Side Effects | status REQUESTED→…→CLOSED; recovery line on payslip; notification on closure |
| Failure Handling | Insufficient net → partial/skip flag `RECOVERY_INSUFFICIENT_NET`; ledger never goes negative |
| Dependencies | FR-04, M11 (terminal settlement) |
| Test Guidance | Amortization correctness (simple/reducing); foreclosure; insufficient-net skip; closure invariant |

### FR-M10-09 — Recoveries & Ad-hoc Adjustments (incl. Disciplinary, Overpayment)

- **Module:** M10-F09
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager, (source) Disciplinary Authority (M09)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to apply recoveries ordered by disciplinary authorities and recover prior overpayments so that mandated deductions are executed accurately and traceably.
- **Description:** Ingest recovery orders from M09 (fine, recovery of loss, pay reduction) and internally-detected overpayments; schedule recovery across one or more cycles within net-protection limits; track recovered-to-date against ordered amount.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A disciplinary recovery order creates a scheduled recovery with a defined total and per-cycle amount.
  - AC2: Recovery never exceeds the ordered total; over-recovery is impossible.
  - AC3: Recovery respects net-pay protection; spillover extends the schedule.
  - AC4: Recovered-to-date is reported and closes when the order is satisfied.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Disciplinary recoveries are authority-mandated and cannot be waived by Payroll. BR2: Overpayment recovery requires documented justification and employee notification. BR3: Recovery priority order: statutory → court attachment → disciplinary → overpayment → loans → voluntary.
- **Data Model References:** `deductions` (RECOVERY), `payslip_lines`, M09 order (read), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/recoveries` | create recovery (from order/overpayment) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/recoveries/{id}` | status & recovered-to-date |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/recoveries/{id}:hold` | pause (justified) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Recovery tracker showing ordered vs recovered vs remaining; source-order link; priority indicator.
- **Edge Cases:** Multiple concurrent recoveries competing for limited net; employee retires before full recovery (transfer to M11); appeal in M09 reverses an order mid-recovery (refund).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RecoveryService`, `PriorityResolver`, M09 client |
| Backend Flow | Receive order → create recovery schedule → each run apply within net protection by priority → track recovered-to-date → close when satisfied |
| Data Operations | INSERT recovery; per-run UPDATE recovered amount; payslip line |
| Validation | Cannot exceed ordered total; priority ordering; net protection |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer/Manager; reversal needs Manager + source confirmation |
| State Changes & Side Effects | recovery active→closed; refund entry on appeal reversal; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Over-recovery prevented; conflict among recoveries resolved by priority |
| Dependencies | M09, FR-04, M11 |

### FR-M10-10 — Arrears & Retrospective Revisions Engine

- **Module:** M10-F10
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want the system to compute arrears for back-dated DA/increment/promotion/pay-fixation so that employees receive the exact difference owed, with statutory deductions re-derived on the differential.
- **Description:** When a retrospective change occurs (DA revision in FR-02, pay-fixation from M06, correction), the engine re-computes pay for each affected past month using then-effective rules, derives the per-component per-month delta vs what was actually paid, recomputes statutory deductions (incl. TDS) on the differential, and produces an `arrears` record paid through an ARREARS cycle.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: For a back-dated DA increase, arrears = Σ over affected months of (new − old) per eligible component, net of recomputed deductions.
  - AC2: The arrear references the source (notification/M06 order) and shows a month-wise break-up.
  - AC3: Arrears recompute TDS impact and flow into Form-16 (FR-17).
  - AC4: Arrears for a LOCKED period never mutate the original payslip — they are additive.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Arrears use rules effective in each historical month, not current rules. BR2: Negative arrears (recovery) are possible (e.g., downward revision) and handled via recovery. BR3: Promotion arrears link to M06 fixation order.
- **Data Model References:** `arrears`, `payslips`/`payslip_lines` (original, read), `rate_tables` (historical), `payroll_cycles` (ARREARS), `deductions`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears:compute` | compute for trigger (DA/fixation) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears/{id}` | arrear breakup |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/arrears/{id}:approve` | approve for payout |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Arrears computation screen with month-wise grid (old vs new vs delta), source reference, net arrear after deduction recompute, and approve-to-cycle action.
- **Edge Cases:** Overlapping retrospective changes (DA + promotion in same window); employee separated during arrear window; arrears crossing financial years (tax relief u/s 89); downward revision causing recovery.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ArrearsEngine`, `HistoricalRecomputer`, `RateTableResolver` |
| Backend Flow | Identify affected employees/months → recompute each month with historical rules → diff vs actual paid → recompute statutory delta → persist arrear → route to ARREARS cycle |
| Data Operations | INSERT arrears with `component_breakup`; link to payout cycle; no mutation of original payslips |
| Validation | Historical rule resolution; delta correctness; period bounds; immutability of source payslips |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer compute; Manager approve |
| State Changes & Side Effects | arrear COMPUTED→APPROVED→PAID; TDS YTD adjusted; M12 pay event if pay-scale changed |
| Failure Handling | Missing historical rate → exception; overlap → ordered application |
| Dependencies | FR-02, FR-06, FR-17, M06, M12 |
| Test Guidance | DA back-dating math; promotion fixation arrears; cross-FY tax; downward revision recovery |

### FR-M10-11 — Supplementary & Off-Cycle Payroll

- **Module:** M10-F11
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, DDO (sanction), Payroll Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to process supplementary and off-cycle payments so that missed payments, new-joiner first pay, bonuses, ex-gratia, and urgent corrections are paid outside the regular cycle with the same controls.
- **Description:** Create SUPPLEMENTARY/OFF_CYCLE/BONUS cycles for a defined employee set and component set, compute with the same engine and controls (reconciliation, approval, bank file), and feed the same statutory/YTD accumulators. Off-cycle payments require sanction.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An off-cycle payment for a defined cohort computes, reconciles, approves, and disburses independently of the regular cycle.
  - AC2: Off-cycle amounts update YTD statutory and tax accumulators.
  - AC3: Off-cycle requires DDO sanction and Manager approval (SoD enforced).
  - AC4: A duplicate off-cycle payment for the same purpose/employee is prevented (idempotency).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Bonus/ex-gratia taxability applied per rules. BR2: Off-cycle cannot pay a component already paid for the same period unless flagged correction. BR3: Same reconciliation and locking gates apply.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_cycles` (OFF_CYCLE/SUPPLEMENTARY), `payroll_runs`, `payslips`, `bank_disbursements`, `deductions`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/runs` | run it |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}:sanction` | DDO sanction |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Off-cycle wizard: select purpose, cohort, components, amounts; preview; sanction & approve workflow; reuse the run console.
- **Edge Cases:** Off-cycle overlapping the regular run; bonus spanning multiple FYs; new joiner first-pay before structure fully approved.
- **LLD:**

### FR-M10-12 — Benefits Administration (Medical, LTC/LTA, Gratuity, Insurance, Reimbursements)

- **Module:** M10-F12
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (claim), Reporting Manager (recommend), Payroll Officer/Manager (verify/pay)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to enrol in and claim benefits (medical, LTC/LTA, reimbursements) and have gratuity/insurance administered so that I receive entitlements correctly and they reflect in pay or off-cycle payout.
- **Description:** Manage benefit enrolment (`benefits`) and claims (`benefit_claims`) with workflow approval; accrue gratuity per period (`gratuity_accruals`); administer group insurance and reimbursement plans. Approved claims pay via payroll or off-cycle; LTC respects block-year rules.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A claim follows submit → recommend → approve → pay; approved amount ≤ entitlement/cap.
  - AC2: LTC claim validates block-year eligibility and prior utilisation.
  - AC3: Gratuity accrues per period using last-drawn basic+DA and years of service, capped at statutory ceiling.
  - AC4: Approved reimbursements appear on payslip (taxable per rules) or off-cycle payout.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Medical/LTC reimbursement taxability per statute. BR2: Gratuity payout settled by M11 at separation; M10 maintains accrual. BR3: Claims require proofs (M13); duplicate proof reuse blocked.
- **Data Model References:** `benefits`, `benefit_claims`, `gratuity_accruals`, `documents`, `payslip_lines`/off-cycle, workflow.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

### FR-M10-13 — Payslip Generation & Self-Service Access

- **Module:** M10-F13
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate/publish), Employee (view)
- **User Story:** As an Employee, I want to view and download my monthly payslip with a full earnings/deductions break-up so that I understand my pay, and as Payroll I want to publish payslips securely once the run is locked.
- **Description:** Render `payslips` into a formatted document (PDF) stored in M13, with employer/employee details, component break-up, YTD figures, leave/LWP, loan/recovery status, and tax summary. Published only after run lock; immutable thereafter. Self-service portal access with masking and audit.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Payslip totals match `payslips`/`payslip_lines` exactly.
  - AC2: Payslips publish only when the run is LOCKED.
  - AC3: Employees see only their own payslips; managers see direct reports per scope.
  - AC4: A published payslip is immutable; a correction generates a new payslip via supplementary/arrears.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Bank account/PAN masked by default. BR2: Payslip includes YTD and tax-projection summary. BR3: Download access is logged.
- **Data Model References:** `payslips`, `payslip_lines`, `documents` (PDF), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/payslips:publish` | publish (post-lock) |

### FR-M10-14 — Bank Disbursement File & Integration

- **Module:** M10-F14
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate), Payroll Manager (sign), Finance/Treasury (receive)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want to generate, validate, sign, and transmit the bank disbursement file and reconcile acknowledgements so that net pay reaches every employee's account accurately and exceptions are handled.
- **Description:** Produce `bank_disbursements` file (NACH/fixed-width/ISO20022) from a LOCKED run's net pay, validate account integrity, compute checksum, sign, transmit to bank/treasury gateway, and reconcile per-line acknowledgements (success/partial/failed). Failed lines route to off-cycle re-disbursement.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: File total = Σ net pay of the run; record count = payees with net>0.
  - AC2: File generation requires a LOCKED, reconciled run.
  - AC3: Signing is performed by a different principal than the run creator (SoD).
  - AC4: Acknowledgement reconciliation marks each line success/failed; failures are actionable.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Invalid/missing bank accounts excluded and flagged before transmission. BR2: A file is transmitted once; re-transmission requires a new batch with reason. BR3: Checksum integrity verified on send and on ack.
- **Data Model References:** `bank_disbursements`, `payslips` (net), `documents` (file), `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

### FR-M10-15 — Payroll Register & Reconciliation

- **Module:** M10-F15
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer, Payroll Manager (sign-off)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want a payroll register with control totals and variance analysis so that I can reconcile the run against the prior period and sign off before approval.
- **Description:** Generate the payroll register (per-employee and component-summarised) and `payroll_reconciliations` with gross/deduction/net control totals, prior-period comparison, variance %, and an exceptions list (new joiners, leavers, large swings, negative nets, quarantined employees). Sign-off is the gate before approval (FR-16).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Control totals equal the run totals and the sum of payslips (three-way tie-out).
  - AC2: Variance vs prior period is computed with drill-down to contributing employees/components.
  - AC3: A run cannot be approved until reconciliation is SIGNED_OFF.
  - AC4: All exceptions are listed and individually explainable/acknowledgeable.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Variance beyond a configurable threshold requires explicit explanation before sign-off. BR2: Quarantined employees from FR-04 appear as exceptions and block sign-off until resolved or deferred. BR3: Sign-off is by a checker, not the run creator.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_reconciliations`, `payroll_runs`, `payslips`, `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/register` | register (paginated) |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/reconciliation` | control totals & variance |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/reconciliation:signoff` | sign off |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Reconciliation dashboard: three-way tie-out cards, variance waterfall, exceptions table with explain action, sign-off button gated by exception resolution.
- **Edge Cases:** Large variance from a legitimate DA arrear; first-ever run (no prior period); unresolved quarantine at sign-off.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ReconciliationService`, `VarianceAnalyzer`, `RegisterExporter` |
| Backend Flow | Compute control totals → tie-out three ways → compare prior period → classify exceptions → require explanations → sign-off |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE reconciliation; read payslips aggregates |
| Validation | Three-way tie-out equality; threshold explanation; exception closure |
| Authorization | Payroll Officer view; Manager sign-off (≠ creator) |
| State Changes & Side Effects | recon PENDING→SIGNED_OFF; unblocks approval; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Tie-out mismatch → block + `RECON_TIEOUT_MISMATCH`; unresolved exceptions → cannot sign |
| Dependencies | FR-04, FR-16 |
| Test Guidance | Three-way tie-out; variance drill-down; sign-off SoD; quarantine blocking |

### FR-M10-16 — Payroll Approval, Finalisation & Locking

- **Module:** M10-F16
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Manager / Controller
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want to approve and lock a reconciled payroll run so that results become immutable, payslips can publish, and disbursement can proceed — with a controlled, justified reopen path only when essential.
- **Description:** Multi-level approval moves a reconciled run to APPROVED then LOCKED. Locking freezes all payslips/lines (`is_immutable=true`) and the cycle (LOCKED). A reopen requires Manager authority + justification and is fully audited; reopen is disabled once disbursement has been transmitted (corrections then go to arrears/supplementary).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Approval requires a SIGNED_OFF reconciliation; approver ≠ run creator.
  - AC2: Locking sets all child payslips immutable and the cycle to LOCKED.
  - AC3: No write to any locked payslip/line succeeds after lock.
  - AC4: Reopen requires justification, is audited, and is blocked post-transmission.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Maker-checker enforced at approval. BR2: Locked runs are the system of record for the period. BR3: Post-disbursement corrections only via arrears/supplementary/off-cycle.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_runs`, `payroll_cycles`, `payslips`, `payroll_reconciliations`, `audit_log`, workflow.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:approve` | approve (checker) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:lock` | finalise & lock |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}:reopen` | reopen (justified) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Approval screen with reconciliation summary, approve/lock actions gated by role + SoD, reopen dialog requiring justification, lock status badge across the cycle.
- **Edge Cases:** Attempt to lock without reconciliation; reopen after transmission; concurrent approval attempts (optimistic locking).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ApprovalService`, `LockService`, optimistic-lock guard |
| Backend Flow | Approve (check recon + SoD) → lock (freeze payslips, set cycle LOCKED) in a transaction → enable publish/disbursement |
| Data Operations | UPDATE run/cycle status; set payslips `is_immutable`; transactional |
| Validation | Recon signed-off; SoD; transmission state for reopen |
| Authorization | Payroll Manager only |
| State Changes & Side Effects | run APPROVED→LOCKED; cycle→LOCKED; immutability enforced; M12 pay events emitted on lock; notifications |
| Failure Handling | Unsigned recon → 409 `RECON_NOT_SIGNED`; post-transmit reopen → 409 `REOPEN_BLOCKED` |
| Dependencies | FR-15, FR-13, FR-14, M12 |
| Test Guidance | Lock immutability (writes rejected); SoD; reopen guardrails; concurrency |

### FR-M10-17 — Statutory Outputs: Form-16, Form-24Q & Remittance Schedules

- **Module:** M10-F17
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Officer (generate), Payroll Manager (certify)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want to generate Form-16, Form-24Q (quarterly TDS), and PT/GPF/NPS remittance schedules so that the organisation meets statutory filing and remittance obligations accurately and on time.
- **Description:** Aggregate YTD earnings, deductions, and TDS to produce employee Form-16 (Part A/B), Form-24Q quarterly returns, and remittance schedules for PT, GPF, NPS, and pension. Outputs are reconciled against payroll registers and YTD accumulators and stored in M13.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Form-16 TDS totals tie to Σ TDS payslip lines for the FY (incl. arrears).
  - AC2: Form-24Q quarterly totals reconcile to the sum of monthly TDS in that quarter.
  - AC3: Remittance schedules list per-scheme amounts with employee/employer split.
  - AC4: Outputs are certified (maker-checker) before release and stored/versioned.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Section 89 relief reflected where arrears span FYs. BR2: PAN mandatory for Form-16; missing PAN flagged. BR3: Remittance deadlines tracked with reminders (FR Notifications).
- **Data Model References:** `deductions` (YTD), `payslips`/`payslip_lines`, `tax_declarations`, `documents`, `audit_log`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/statutory/form16:generate` | generate Form-16 (FY) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/statutory/form24q:generate` | quarterly TDS return |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/statutory/remittances?scheme=PT&period=` | remittance schedule |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Statutory output center: select FY/quarter, generate, reconcile-status indicator, certify & release, employee Form-16 self-service download.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year joiner/leaver Form-16; revised return after correction; missing PAN; cross-FY arrears relief.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `Form16Generator`, `Form24QGenerator`, `RemittanceScheduler`, document client |
| Backend Flow | Aggregate YTD per employee/scheme → reconcile to registers → render outputs → certify → store/version in M13 |
| Data Operations | Read YTD; INSERT output document refs; no payroll mutation |
| Validation | TDS tie-out; PAN presence; period completeness |
| Authorization | Payroll generate; Manager certify; Employee self-download Form-16 |
| State Changes & Side Effects | output documents created; notifications for deadlines; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Tie-out mismatch → block + reconcile report; missing PAN → exception list |
| Dependencies | FR-06/07/10, M13 |
| Test Guidance | Form-16 tie-out incl. arrears; 24Q quarterly reconciliation; cross-FY relief; missing-PAN handling |

### FR-M10-18 — Parallel / What-If Run & Cost-to-Organisation Analytics

- **Module:** M10-F04 / M10-F18
- **Primary Role(s):** Payroll Manager, Department Head, Finance
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Manager, I want to run what-if/parallel payroll scenarios and view cost-to-organisation analytics so that I can model the impact of DA revisions, increments, or restructuring and report payroll cost by org/cadre/component.
- **Description:** Execute PARALLEL_WHATIF runs that compute against proposed parameters (e.g., new DA%, increment cycle) without affecting live data, producing comparison reports vs the actual run. Provide cost analytics: total payroll cost, headcount cost, component-wise and org-wise breakdown, period trends, and employer-contribution costs (NPS/pension/gratuity accrual).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A what-if run never writes live payslips/disbursements; results are clearly labelled scenario data.
  - AC2: A comparison report shows delta (scenario vs actual) by component and org unit.
  - AC3: Cost analytics aggregate gross, deductions, net, and employer cost by org/cadre/component/period.
  - AC4: Analytics respect row-level org scope per role.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Scenario runs are retained for audit and labelled. BR2: Employer contributions and gratuity accrual are included in true cost-to-org. BR3: Analytics read from locked runs for actuals; scenarios for projections.
- **Data Model References:** `payroll_runs` (PARALLEL_WHATIF), `payslips` (scenario, segregated), aggregates over `payslip_lines`, `gratuity_accruals`.
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/payroll/cycles/{id}/runs` (run_mode=PARALLEL_WHATIF) | scenario run |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/runs/{id}/comparison?vs={actualRunId}` | scenario vs actual |
| GET | `/api/v1/payroll/analytics/cost-to-org?groupBy=org_unit,component&period=` | cost analytics |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Scenario builder with parameter overrides; comparison view (delta highlighting); analytics dashboard with drill-down charts and export; scope-aware filters.
- **Edge Cases:** Scenario over a very large cohort; comparing across structure versions; analytics across cycles with arrears.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | reuse `ComputationEngine` in scenario mode, `ComparisonService`, `CostAnalyticsService` |
| Backend Flow | Run engine with override params into segregated scenario store → compute deltas vs actual → aggregate cost analytics from locked runs |
| Data Operations | INSERT scenario payslips (flagged); read-only aggregates for analytics |
| Validation | Scenario isolation (no live write); scope enforcement |
| Authorization | Manager/Dept Head/Finance; org scope |
| State Changes & Side Effects | scenario run stored & labelled; no live side effects; audit_log |
| Failure Handling | Accidental live write prevented by mode guard; large query → async export |
| Dependencies | FR-04, FR-16, M14 (feeds dashboards) |
| Test Guidance | Scenario isolation; delta correctness; analytics aggregation incl. employer cost; scope filtering |

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data Migration

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Master data | Load pay scales, pay-matrix levels, DA/HRA/PT/tax tables (effective-dated) |
| Employee structures | Migrate current salary structure per employee with current version + history where available |
| Deduction setup | Migrate GPF/NPS/PT scheme assignments and YTD balances |
| Loans | Migrate outstanding loans with amortization remaining and recovered-to-date |
| YTD accumulators | Load FY-to-date earnings/deductions/TDS for mid-year cutover (critical for Form-16 continuity) |
| Benefits | Migrate enrolments, LTC block-year utilisation, gratuity accrual baseline |

### 13.2 Validation & Parallel Run

- Run a **parallel payroll** for at least 2 cycles vs the legacy system; reconcile per-employee net to zero variance before cutover.
- Reconcile YTD accumulators and statutory totals before first live Form-24Q.

### 13.3 Cutover & Launch

- Freeze legacy; lock migrated balances; run first live cycle in DRAFT, reconcile, then FINAL.
- Phased rollout by org unit/cohort; self-service (payslip/declaration) enabled after first successful published cycle.
- Rollback plan: retain legacy read-only; first-cycle abort path defined.

### 13.4 Launch Readiness Checklist

Master data loaded & approved; structures reconciled; YTD loaded; bank file format certified with bank in test; reconciliation tie-out passing; SoD roles assigned; statutory output formats validated against portal; audit logging verified.

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Computation Order (default earning→deduction sequence)

1. BASIC → 2. DA (% basic) → 3. HRA (city-class % basic) → 4. Transport & other allowances → 5. Special pay → 6. Gross earnings → 7. GPF/NPS (% basic / basic+DA) → 8. PT (slab on gross) → 9. TDS (projection-based) → 10. Loan recovery → 11. Court attachment/disciplinary recovery (by priority) → 12. Voluntary deductions → 13. Net pay (with net-protection re-balancing).

### 16.2 Rounding & Money Rules

- All amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)`; rates `NUMERIC(9,4)`; no floating point.
- Component rounding per `pay_rules.rounding`; default NEAREST (half-up) to rupee.
- Statutory deductions use their prescribed rounding.

### 16.3 Net-Pay Protection & Recovery Priority

Statutory (TDS/PT/GPF/NPS) → court attachment → disciplinary recovery → overpayment recovery → loans → voluntary. If net would fall below the protected floor, lower-priority recoveries are reduced/deferred and flagged; spillover extends schedules.

### 16.4 Immutability & Correction Policy

A LOCKED run and its payslips are immutable. Corrections never edit the original; they are issued as: (a) arrears (FR-10) for retrospective entitlement, (b) supplementary/off-cycle (FR-11) for missed/additional payments, or (c) recovery (FR-09) for overpayments. Each correction references the original run for traceability.

### 16.5 Assumptions Log

- Single legal entity per deployment (data model is entity-aware for future multi-entity).
- Bank/treasury supports a documented file format; format is pluggable.
- Enterprise notifications drive rate-table updates; entered by SysAdmin and approved by Payroll Manager.
- 30-day vs actual-days LWP basis is a configurable policy switch.
