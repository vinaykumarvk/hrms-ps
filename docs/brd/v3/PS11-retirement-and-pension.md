# Retirement and Pension Management — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS11, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Module code:** PS11 (alias `PS-M11`; supersedes the `SHARED_FOUNDATION` id `M11-PEN`)
**Program:** PrimeSoft HRMS — a public-sector configuration and extension of the **PrimeSoft HRMS** platform (Vision §1.1; `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §1)
**Relationship (from `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A):** **NET-NEW (enterprise-specific)** — PrimeSoft has no pension/superannuation engine. PS11 authors the pension/terminal-benefits calculation engine, commutation, qualifying-service consumption and pension-sanction case **as net-new statutory business logic that runs on the platform engines** (P01 workflow, P05 audit, P06 migration) and consumes PS01 master + the PS12 SR ledger.
**Authoring standard:** World-class global HCM (Workday / SAP SuccessFactors / Oracle HCM bar) honouring Indian public-sector statutory pension rules (CCS Pension Rules-style framework, NPS, **UPS (eff. 01-Apr-2025)**, GPF, Jeevan Pramaan/DLC, DoPPW *Bhavishya*/DigiLocker benchmarks), **re-grounded onto the PrimeSoft platform contracts**.
**Source of truth (authority order, `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §1.1):**
- **Master BRD v2.1** owns requirements, data-model conventions, RBAC matrix, NFR thresholds, notification triggers, state machines.
- **RBAC Design v1.7** owns the access-control model; PS11 adds enterprise roles + capability flags as ADDITIONS.
- **Foundation FS v1.6** owns the `VAL-*`/`JOB-*`/`MSG-*`/`ERR-*` catalogues; PS11 authors only `VAL-PS11-*` / `JOB-PS11-*` / `MSG-PS11-*` / `ERR-PS11-*` and registers them in the Foundation indexes.
- **Platform Spec v1.6** owns engine internals (P01–P06), X.1–X.3 infrastructure, W.1–W.3 configured-content models; PS11 references services and configures flows/forms, never re-implementing an engine.
- This BRD **references** the v2 functional rigor (`docs/brd/v2/M11-retirement-and-pension.md`) and the platform grounding (`docs/brd/PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`, `docs/brd/MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md`).

**Document version:** v3.0 (platform re-grounded — supersedes v2.0). Preserves **all** v2 content, entities, FRs, state machines, calculation appendices and rigor; re-anchors every cross-cutting concern (workflow, audit, jobs, integrations, RBAC, API conventions, NFR, migration, multi-tenancy) onto the existing PrimeSoft platform.
**Status:** Re-grounded for platform-consistency review. v2's seven Critical findings (R1–R7), eleven High/Medium/Low findings (R8–R18) and three world-class additions remain incorporated; v3 adds the platform alignment and the v2→v3 amendment ledger.

> **Reading rule (inherited from `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`).** Where this BRD authors net-new statutory logic that PrimeSoft genuinely lacks it is the **`GAP (enterprise-specific)`** surface; everywhere else it consumes a platform contract by id (`P01`, `P05`, `X.3`, `RBAC v1.7`, …). When a v2 convention conflicts with the real platform, the platform governs (logged in `## Amendments (v2 → v3)` and traceable to `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C).

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Retirement and Pension Management module (**PS11**) governs the complete lifecycle of an employee's separation from service and the lifelong administration of their pensionary and terminal benefits. It manages every **separation type** (superannuation/age retirement, voluntary retirement (VRS), compulsory retirement ordered under disciplinary proceedings, invalidation/medical retirement, death-in-service, and resignation); computes **qualifying service** (now including structured **counted prior/military service**) and the full benefit set (basic pension, **service gratuity for <10-year service**, commutation, family/enhanced family pension, retirement and death gratuity, leave encashment, GPF final withdrawal) **net of statutory tax/TDS**; generates the statutory **Pension Payment Order (PPO)** including **provisional PPOs for pending proceedings (Rule 9)**; and maintains the **pensioner master** and pensioner lifecycle (life-certificate/Jeevan Pramaan, restoration of commuted portion, conversion to family pension on a pensioner's death, **proactive death-detection and overpayment recovery**, and pension revision on DA or pay-commission changes under a **deterministic revision-application order**).

PS11 is engineered as a **rule-driven, audit-grade benefit engine** that is deterministic and reproducible **on top of a rigorous input-provenance gate** — and it is engineered as a **platform-native module**: every approval/maker-checker step runs on the **P01 WorkflowEngine**; every mutation is captured immutably by the **P05 dual audit log** (DB-trigger, 7-yr); every scheduled computation runs on the **X.1 background-job runner** as a registered `JOB-PS11-*` job; every external call (treasury/PDA, DigiLocker, penny-drop, DBT) runs on the **X.3 integration framework** with credentials from **P04**; and access is enforced by **P02** against the **RBAC v1.7** model. Benefits are never hand-keyed; they are *derived* from verified service history in the **Digital Service Register (PS12 SR ledger)**, last-pay-drawn and contribution history from **Payroll (PS10)**, leave balances and LWP spells from **Attendance & Leave (PS03)** and the **Leave→SR integration (PS04)**, and disciplinary orders from **Disciplinary Cases (PS09)**, evaluated against **first-class, effective-dated, versioned pension rule-table entities** (DA/Dearness-Relief rates, commutation factors, family-pension rates, gratuity ceilings with the DA-linked auto-step, retirement ages, minimum/maximum pension, rounding) managed through the **platform configuration cascade and versioning**. Crucially, computation is **gated by an e-SR completeness & discrepancy-resolution stage** (per-spell reason-code attestation, condonation register, multi-point sign-off) so that determinism defends correct numbers rather than amplifying upstream defects. Once a benefit case is **sanctioned and a PPO is issued, the calculation snapshot is immutable** — enforced through P05 — and corrections flow only through controlled revision/re-issue with full audit. Every rupee of pension is traceable from qualifying-service input through PPO to disbursement, and every audit objection is tracked to closure.

### 1.2 Business Context and Problem Statement

Public-sector retirement processing is high-stakes, statutorily intricate, and time-critical: an employee who superannuates on the last day of a month must receive pension from the next day without a break. Processing combines **service-record verification** (gap-free service from joining to retirement), **qualifying-service arithmetic** (deducting non-qualifying spells such as extraordinary leave without pay, dies-non, and unauthorised absence, and *adding* counted prior service), **three pension regimes** — **Old Pension Scheme (OPS)** for pre-cutoff entrants, **National Pension System (NPS)** for later entrants (with the **CCS (Implementation of NPS) Rules 2021** death/invalidation default benefit), and the **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)** assured payout for opted-in employees — **commutation actuarial factors**, **family-pension rules** (normal vs enhanced rates with *path-specific* eligibility windows), **gratuity ceilings**, **tax/TDS treatment** of terminal benefits, and **DA/pay-commission revisions** applied to a live pensioner population for decades, sometimes by **bank CPPCs that themselves apply Dearness Relief**. Manual processing produces delayed first pensions, miscalculated benefits, audit objections, litigation, pension drawn into deceased pensioners' accounts, and hardship to bereaved families. PS11 eliminates these by making the rule set explicit and versioned (through the platform config cascade), the computation reproducible and traceable **only after the input is proven complete**, the workflow gated by service verification and no-dues (on P01), the disbursement model explicit per PDA (over X.3), fraud caught proactively, and the pensioner lifecycle fully digital — with a **plain-language citizen layer** over the statutory core.

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives

| # | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Zero break in pension | First pension/anticipatory/provisional pension authorised on/before the day after retirement for 100% of cases |
| G2 | Deterministic, reproducible benefit computation | Re-running a case **with the snapshotted rule version and the same verified inputs** yields identical benefit figures and trace. *External/indicative NPS-CRA and UPS-annuity figures are explicitly excluded from the determinism guarantee.* |
| G3 | Statutory accuracy | 100% correct qualifying-service, pension (flat 50% ≥10 yrs / service gratuity <10 yrs), commutation, gratuity, *path-specific* family-pension, UPS/NPS-default, and tax computation against published rules |
| G4 | Service-verified eligibility | No CALCULATION without a **signed-off service-verification record** (discrepancy ledger closed, spells attested); no PPO without PS12 SR verification complete and no-dues cleared |
| G5 | Digital, self-service retirement | Retiring employee tracks case via a **3-state plain-language tracker**, runs **outcome-framed estimators**, and submits forms online (W.2 forms on P01); pensioner submits Digital Life Certificate online and receives the e-PPO in **DigiLocker** (over X.3) |
| G6 | Lifelong pensioner integrity | Correct DA/pay-commission revision under a **deterministic application order**, commuted-portion restoration on the **reduction-date+15yr** schedule, family-pension conversion, and proactive death/fraud control across the pensioner's life |
| G7 | Forecasting & liability transparency | Accurate due-for-retirement forecasts and pension-liability analytics by org unit, cadre, and horizon (feeding PS14) |
| G8 | Audit-objection closure | 100% of AG/internal-audit objections tracked from raise to closure with linkage to the case and `calc_trace`, all mutations captured in the P05 audit substrate |
| **G9 (platform)** | **Platform-native execution** | Every approval runs on P01; every mutation captured by P05; every batch on X.1 as a `JOB-PS11-*`; every external call on X.3 with P04 credentials; access enforced by P02 against RBAC v1.7. **Zero bespoke workflow/audit/job/integration plumbing.** |

### 1.4 Scope Summary

In scope: retirement forecasting & due-for-retirement lists; separation-case management for all separation types; **e-SR completeness & discrepancy-resolution gate**; pre-retirement processing (1–2 years ahead: SR verification with PS12, no-dues clearance, anticipatory pension); **provisional pension for pending proceedings (Rule 9)**; qualifying-service computation with non-qualifying-spell deduction **and counted prior-service addition**; pension calculation (basic OPS flat-rate / **service gratuity** / **NPS death-default** / **UPS assured payout**); commutation **with explicit reduction/restoration timing**; retirement, death **and service** gratuity (ceiling **auto-stepping on DA milestones**); **path-specific** family & enhanced family pension driven by a **statutory family-members register** (with **dual family pension and twin/multiple-children** support); terminal benefits & final settlement (incl. leave encashment from PS03, GPF final withdrawal) **with tax/TDS and Section 89(1) relief**; PPO generation (incl. digital PPO, **DigiLocker delivery over X.3**); pensioner master & lifecycle (life certificate/Jeevan Pramaan, restoration, family-pension conversion); **proactive death-detection (death-registry/Aadhaar-DBT reconciliation over X.3) and overpayment recovery from estate**; pension revision on DA/pay-commission under a **deterministic ordering rule** and an explicit **paymaster-vs-authoriser disbursement model**; treasury/bank/PDA integration on the **X.3 framework with a defined payload-versioned contract and pre-credit penny-drop verification**; retirement self-service portal & **outcome-framed estimators/what-if**; pensioner grievance management; **audit-objection management**; **effective-dated rule-table management (via the platform config cascade)**; and forecasting & pension-liability analytics (to PS14).

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): the canonical employee master (**PS01**, on the platform `employees` master); the SR ledger itself (**PS12** — the net-new enterprise ledger on the P05 substrate) — PS11 **consumes** the ledger for qualifying-service verification **and IS the SR writer for the separation/superannuation/retirement life events**, posting them to the canonical **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** write-port (see §8.7, `source_module="PS11"`); PS11 does not own the ledger engine, only authors the separation events it emits; payroll computation of in-service salary and the monthly active-employee payslip (**PS10**, extending PrimeSoft M06/M07) — PS11 consumes last-pay-drawn and contribution history; leave capture and encashable-balance maintenance (**PS03**) and the leave→SR posting (**PS04**); disciplinary adjudication that issues a compulsory-retirement penalty order or recovery (**PS09**) — PS11 consumes the order; document storage internals (**platform `documents` / DocumentGen**, the PS13 vault) — PS11 references, never redefines; core banking/treasury ledger posting beyond producing and reconciling the disbursement file and (where the PDA is a CPPC) the Dearness-Relief application that the bank performs. **All workflow, RBAC, audit, notification, job-runner, migration and configured-content engines are platform-provided (P01–P06, X.1–X.3, W.1–W.3) and consumed by id, never re-authored.**

### 1.5 Key Stakeholders

Retiring Employee / Pensioner / Family Pensioner (self-service via the **Me** workspace), **Pension Officer / Dealing Assistant (maker — new RBAC v1.7 entity-scoped module-admin role, analogous to Payroll Admin)**, **Pension Sanctioning Authority / Head of Office (checker — new RBAC v1.7 role, P01 approver, SoD-enforced)**, HR Officer/Admin (`hr_admin`), **SR Custodian/Registrar (PS12 — new role + capability flag on the SR ledger)**, Payroll Officer (**PS10** last-pay & contributions), Department Head / Appointing Authority, **Treasury / Pension Disbursing Authority (PDA) / Bank CPPC (new role + capability flag; integration over X.3)**, Medical Board (invalidation), **Auditor / AG (mapped to Org-Admin read + P05 query entitlement — no parallel write role)**, **Disciplinary Authority (PS09, provisional-pension linkage)**, System Administrator (rule tables — mapped to Org Admin / Platform Super Admin). All roles, scoping, SoD and PII ceilings are owned by **RBAC v1.7** and enforced by **P02**; PS11 only adds the new roles/flags as ADDITIONS (see §6 and §`Alignment`).

### 1.6 Success Criteria

A retirement case is "successful" when: the separation is recorded with the correct type and date (P01 case flow); **service verification is signed off with the discrepancy ledger closed and every non-qualifying spell reason-code-attested**; no-dues is cleared; qualifying service (including counted prior service) and all benefits — under the correct OPS/NPS/UPS regime, with service gratuity where service <10 yrs, path-specific family pension, and tax/TDS — are computed deterministically against a snapshotted rule version with full trace and sanctioned by an authority distinct from the maker (SoD enforced by P01/P02); the PPO (and where applicable anticipatory **or provisional** pension) is issued before pension commencement; terminal benefits and GPF are settled net of tax; the pensioner is enrolled in the pensioner master; the disbursement instruction passes **pre-credit account verification** and is accepted by the PDA/bank over X.3 under the recorded disbursement model; and a retirement event is appended to **PS12** — all with a complete, immutable **P05** audit trail and any audit objection tracked to closure.

### 3.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from the PrimeSoft platform)

All PS11 features inherit, **by id and not by re-authoring** (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §5/§9): UUID PKs + human business keys; **`tenant_id`/`entity_id` on every business table with data-layer scoping (Platform §0.1)**; standard audit fields; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE status enums; UTC storage / locale display; `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates; INR default currency; **cursor pagination only** (`?limit=` default 25/max 100 + `cursor=` → `next_cursor`); **maker-checker via the P01 WorkflowEngine** (`startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel`, in-flight version pinning, SLA/escalation); **RBAC v1.7 + five-dimension row-level scoping enforced by P02**; **immutable P05 dual-log audit (`audit_log` + `security_audit_log`) written by DB trigger on every mutation**; platform **`documents`/DocumentGen** for generated artefacts (PPO, sanction orders, calculation sheets — the PS13 vault); **X.2 notifications** referenced by `MSG-*` id; **PS12 `service_register_events`** for retirement/separation events (the net-new enterprise ledger on the P05 substrate); **X.1 job runner** for all scheduled work; **X.3 integration framework** for all external calls with **P04** credentials; **P06** ETL+V for legacy migration; the canonical **`{error:{code,message,field,details}}`** envelope + `X-Correlation-Id` header + the 8-code error table.

### 3.3 In-Scope / Out-of-Scope Boundary Table

| Concern | In PS11? | Owner / Note |
|---|---|---|
| Employee master data | Reference only | **PS01** (golden source on platform `employees`) |
| Service history / SR ledger | Verify, **reconcile discrepancies** & **write (separation/superannuation events)** | **PS12** owns the ledger engine (net-new enterprise ledger on P05); PS11 **consumes** it for the completeness/discrepancy gate (FR-PS11-18) **and is the canonical SR writer** for the separation/superannuation/retirement life events, posting via **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (`source_module="PS11"`; §8.7) |
| Last-pay-drawn & contribution history | Consume only | **PS10** supplies emoluments base, GPF/NPS contributions |
| Leave encashable balance & LWP/non-qualifying spells | Consume only | **PS03** supplies encashable EL balance and leave events; **PS04** posts leave events to the SR; PS11 computes encashment / deductions |
| Compulsory-retirement penalty order | Consume the order | **PS09** adjudicates (P01 due-process flow); PS11 processes the resulting separation |
| Pending departmental/judicial proceedings | **Consume status; drive provisional pension** | **PS09** supplies proceedings status; PS11 issues provisional pension & withholds DCRG (FR-PS11-22) |
| Disciplinary recovery against benefits | Consume; net from settlement | **PS09** issues recovery; PS11 nets within statutory protection |
| Active-employee payroll run | Out | **PS10** (PS11 begins at separation/retirement) |
| Pension monthly disbursement & **Dearness-Relief application** | Instruction + reconcile over X.3; **DR by PS11 or by PDA per model** | PDA/Treasury/Bank disburse; where PDA is a CPPC it applies DR (FR-PS11-21 model) |
| Document storage internals | Reference | Platform **`documents`/DocumentGen** (PS13 vault) store PPO/sanction/calc-sheet objects |
| Medical fitness adjudication | Consume verdict | Medical Board issues invalidation certificate; PS11 records & uses it |
| Income-tax assessment | Compute TDS at source only | PS11 computes exemptions/TDS/89(1) on terminal benefits; final assessment is the tax authority's |
| Death-registry / Aadhaar-DBT signals | **Reconcile over X.3** | PS11 ingests death/payment signals to detect post-death drawals (FR-PS11-20) |
| Workflow / audit / notification / job / migration / RBAC engines | **Consume by id** | **Platform P01/P05/X.2/X.1/P06/P02** — never re-implemented |

### 3.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- Pension/commutation/gratuity rules, DA rates for pensioners, commutation factors by age, family-pension rates, and gratuity ceilings are **first-class, effective-dated rule-table entities** (E30–E36), version-controlled and approved through the **platform configuration cascade** (`platform default → tenant → entity → employee`; Platform §0.3) and effective-dated via the **`VAL-EFFECTIVE` / `JOB-PS11-EFFDATE`** staging mechanism (changes staged, not written live; Foundation §1/§3.3). `rule_version_ref` is a **foreign key** to a concrete rule-version row, not free text.
- The OPS/NPS/UPS cutover dates and the UPS opt-in window are configurable config entities; scheme is derived from `employees.date_of_joining` (PS01) and recorded contribution history (PS10), overridable with justification and **P05-audited** reason. **UPS** applies to opted-in NPS employees from 01-Apr-2025.
- The deployment is **one PrimeSoft tenant** (single enterprise); each department/directorate is an `entity` (Standalone / Group-Company model, Vision §1.4). The data model is **tenant- and entity-aware** (`tenant_id`/`entity_id` non-nullable; scoping at the data layer).
- All money math uses fixed-point decimal (`NUMERIC`); rounding rules per statutory prescription are explicit and configurable via E36 (`rounding_rules`).
- "Emoluments" / "average emoluments" base and the reckonable period are configurable policy parameters resolved per case and snapshotted. **UPS** uses the last-12-month average pay base.
- Digital Life Certificate integrates with a Jeevan Pramaan-style service **over X.3**; manual life-certificate capture (physical/video-KYC/bank-certified) is always available as a fallback.
- The **disbursement model is explicit per PDA** (FR-PS11-21): some PDAs are paid an exact computed amount (M11_COMPUTES_FULL); CPPC banks are sent the basic + relief formula and apply DR themselves (PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF). Determinism and batch sizing branch on this; both run over **X.3**.
- Determinism is guaranteed **only after** the service-verification record is signed off (FR-PS11-18) and against the snapshotted rule version; external NPS-CRA/UPS-annuity figures are indicative and excluded.

## 4. Platform Foundation Adopted (replaces v2 §4 "Shared Application Foundation")

PS11 does **not** re-author technical defaults. It adopts the PrimeSoft platform contracts verbatim (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`):

- **Multi-tenancy & scoping (Platform §0.1):** every PS11 table carries non-nullable `tenant_id` and (entity-scoped) `entity_id`; all access is scoped at the persistence layer; an unscoped query is **rejected, not defaulted to "all"**. Cross-entity reach is Org-Admin-only as a widened filter; cross-tenant reach is Platform-Super-Admin-only.
- **Authentication & session (Platform §0.2; RBAC):** bearer JWT carries resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; permissions resolved per request by **P02**. **MFA enforced** for the high-privilege statutory roles (Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority, PDA, SR Custodian) per `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §3.1.
- **API conventions (Foundation §1):** `/api/v1`; **`Idempotency-Key`** on every transaction-creating POST (24h replay returns the original result); **cursor pagination only**; **`X-Correlation-Id`** echoed and written to every audit/log line; effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` and are staged.
- **Canonical error envelope + 8-code table (Foundation §1):** `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field", "details" } }`; codes `VALIDATION_FAILED (422)`, `UNAUTHENTICATED (401)`, `FORBIDDEN (403)`, `NOT_FOUND (404)`, `CONFLICT (409)`, `PRECONDITION_FAILED (412)`, `RATE_LIMITED (429)`, `INTERNAL (500)`. Domain conditions are conveyed as a `details.reason`/`ERR-PS11-*` id under one of these codes (see §8.3).
- **Money type:** `NUMERIC(15,2)` for benefit amounts; rates/factors `NUMERIC(9,4)`; service durations integer Y/M/D; no floating point.
- **Computation determinism (restated):** every benefit engine is a pure function of (**signed-off** verified service record, emoluments snapshot from PS10, scheme, **rule-version rows** effective on the relevant date, beneficiary/family data). Same inputs → same outputs **given the snapshotted rule version**; a `calc_trace` (JSONB) is persisted with each calculation.
- **Input-provenance gate:** no benefit engine runs until the case has a `service_verifications` row in `SIGNED_OFF`/`LOCKED` status with its discrepancy ledger closed and every spell attested (FR-PS11-18).
- **Immutability (via P05):** a sanctioned calculation and its issued PPO are append-only snapshots; the **P05 DB-trigger** captures every mutation immutably (`audit_log` grants no UPDATE/DELETE; the only permitted mutation is a DPDPA right-to-erasure redaction marker). Corrections create a new revision linked to the original — **no silent edit is possible because the audit trigger cannot be bypassed**.
- **Transactionality:** sanction, PPO issue, family-pension conversion, revision-apply, and death-conversion each commit as all-or-nothing transactions; multi-step settlement writes use transactions.
- **Encryption & PII (RBAC §3.9 / P02):** bank account numbers, PAN/national_id/Aadhaar/PRAN, nominee/family details and benefit amounts are Tier-1/Tier-2 PII/financial — encrypted at rest, **masked on serialization by P02** (an over-broad query cannot leak a masked field), access logged. The **PII Protection Ceiling overrides everything upward**. Death-registry/DBT reconciliation data is processed under DPDP purpose-limitation.
- **NFR baseline (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §8.2 — overrides the invented v2 NFR):** Standard API p95 < 500 ms @ 300 concurrent; read-heavy p95 < 300 ms cached / < 1000 ms uncached; writes p95 < 1500 ms; **uptime 99.5%/month** (not 99.9%); **RTO < 4 h, RPO < 1 h** (not 15 min); 100% audit capture; WCAG 2.1 AA; soft-delete only.
- **Determinism contract for concurrent events:** when multiple pensioner events share an effective date, the engine applies them in the mandatory order of §16.9.

---

## 5. Holistic Data Model

Every PS11-owned entity below additionally carries **`tenant_id` (non-nullable)** and **`entity_id` (entity-scoped)** plus the platform audit fields (`created_at/updated_at/created_by/updated_by/is_deleted`); the **P05 DB trigger** writes an immutable `audit_log` row on every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE. These are not repeated in every field table — they are universal per `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §2/§5.

### 5.2 Full Field Tables (PS11-owned entities)

Carried-forward entities E04–E21 retain their v2 field tables; the changed ones are reproduced with new/changed fields marked. New entities E26–E42 are given full field tables. **Note:** entity table names are prefixed `pen_` to avoid collision in the shared platform schema; v2 logical names are retained in prose.

- All benefit calcs `N—1 rule-version rows` (E30–E36) via `rule_version_ref` (FK).
- **Platform edges:** every entity writes **`audit_log` (P05)** via DB trigger; case/sign-off/sanction/revision approvals run on **`workflow_instances` (P01)**; generated PPOs/sanctions/calc-sheets reference platform **`documents`** (PS13 vault); retirement events append to **`service_register_events` (PS12)**; outbound events are **`notifications` (X.2)**; external calls use **`integration_credentials` (P04)** over **X.3**; e-PPO pushed to DigiLocker (FR-PS11-24, over X.3).

### 5.4 Ownership / Reuse Matrix (delta)

Unchanged from v2 for E04–E21. New PS11-owned entities E26–E42 are owned/written by PS11, read by PS14/Auditor; `pen_disbursing_authorities` and the rule tables (E30–E36) are written only by SysAdmin (Org Admin) under SoD approval (FR-PS11-19/21) and read by every benefit engine. `pen_family_members` is sourced from PS01/employee Form-3/14 declarations but mastered in PS11 for pension purposes. All platform tables (`audit_log`, `workflow_instances`, `service_register_events`, `notifications`, `integration_credentials`, `migration_runs`, `documents`) are **referenced, never owned**.

### 5.6 Data Integrity Rules (carried from v2, platform-aware)

- **IR2 (amended):** `net_qualifying = gross − Σ(uncondoned non-qualifying days) + Σ(counted prior-service days)`; condoned spells (E29) count as qualifying.
- **IR2a:** a case cannot enter CALCULATION unless its `pen_service_verifications` row is `SIGNED_OFF`/`LOCKED` with `discrepancy_open_count = 0` and `spells_attested_count = spells_total_count`. The three-point sign-off is a **P01 PARALLEL_ALL_OF** flow.
- **IR3a:** if `meets_min_pension_service = false`, no FULL_PENSION row may exist; a SERVICE_GRATUITY row is mandatory.
- **IR4a:** `restoration_due_date = reduction_effective_date + statutory_period`; `migrated_date_unknown = true` → manual review, not auto-applied by `JOB-PS11-RESTORE`.
- **IR8 (amended):** family-pension eligibility/hierarchy derive from E26 by `statutory_rank`, never from E21. On a self-pensioner death, a CONVERTED `pen_family_pension_records` row + FAMILY_PENSION PPO are created with `enhanced_basis = AFTER_RETIREMENT`.
- **IR8a:** death-in-service family pension uses `enhanced_basis = IN_SERVICE`; after-retirement conversion uses AFTER_RETIREMENT. Windows computed from E32.
- **IR14 (amended):** Σ `nominees.share_pct` per scope (GRATUITY/GPF/LEAVE_ENCASHMENT) = 100.00 (`VAL-NOMINEE`). Family-pension twins/eligible children draw per `concurrent_share_pct` summing to 100.00; dual FP subject to `dual_fp_cap_amount`.
- **IR15:** a PROVISIONAL PPO requires `proceedings_pending = true` and `dcrg_withheld = true`; DCRG released/recovered only on `proceedings_concluded_on`.
- **IR16:** no FIRST_PENSION/TERMINAL/GRATUITY/GPF/COMMUTED_VALUE disbursement line to an account may be TRANSMITTED unless a `pen_bank_account_verifications` row for that account is `PASSED`.
- **IR17:** `rule_version_ref` must point to a rule-version row whose status was EFFECTIVE on the relevant date; SUPERSEDED rows remain referenced by historic calcs (immutability via P05).
- **IR18:** when ≥2 revision events share an effective date for one pensioner, they apply in the §16.9 order; `calc_trace` records the applied order.
- **IR19:** an E38 row in IDENTIFIED/NOTIFIED/UNDER_RECOVERY holds the pensioner's disbursement where rules require, and links to any family-pension conversion.
- All v1 IRs (IR1, IR5–IR7, IR9–IR13) carried forward unchanged.

### 5.7 Sample Data

The v2 sample rows (separation_cases, family_members, service_verifications, service_discrepancies, pension_calculations, gratuity_calculations, family_pension_records, commutation_records, terminal_settlements, disbursing_authorities, rule tables, provisional_pension_records, audit_objections, bank_account_verifications, prior_service_records) are **carried forward unchanged** (each now additionally carrying `tenant_id`/`entity_id`). They are not re-printed here; see `docs/brd/v2/M11-retirement-and-pension.md` §5.7 for the illustrative 2–3 rows per entity. Key representative values are unchanged (e.g. PPO `PPO-2026-004512`, restoration `2041-10-15`, gratuity ceiling auto-stepped to `2,500,000`).

## 6. Functional Requirements

> Re-grounding rule for every FR: approvals/maker-checker run on **P01** (`startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel`, SoD enforced by P01/P02, in-flight version pinning); every mutation is captured by the **P05** DB-trigger; scheduled work runs as a registered **`JOB-PS11-*`** job on **X.1**; external calls run on **X.3** with **P04** credentials; access is checked via **`Authorization.check` (P02)** against **RBAC v1.7**; notifications fire via **X.2** referencing **`MSG-PS11-*`** ids; data-collection screens are **W.2 forms** referencing **`VAL-*`/`VAL-PS11-*`**; every entity carries `tenant_id`/`entity_id`. FRs marked **(enhanced)** carry v2 content with adopted-improvement changes; FR-18–FR-24 are net-new statutory engines. All v2 ACs, BRs, edge cases and LLD rows are preserved.

### FR-PS11-01 — Retirement Forecasting & Due-for-Retirement Lists

- **Module:** PS11-F01
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want an automatically refreshed list of employees due to retire by horizon so processing starts 1–2 years ahead and no first pension is delayed.
- **Description:** Compute each active employee's projected superannuation date from `dob` + applicable retirement age (resolved from `pen_retirement_age_rules` E34 via the config cascade), classify into horizon buckets, surface those due within 24/12/6 months, flag whether a case is already initiated, and drive proactive alerts. Refreshed nightly by **`JOB-PS11-FORECAST`** (X.1; idempotent per-period run key, backoff ×3, `JOB-FAIL`→`MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL`) and on-demand.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Projected retirement date = last day of the month in which the employee attains the configured superannuation age (per E34 cadre rule), recomputed on DOB/cadre change.
  - AC2: Lists filter by org unit, cadre, horizon bucket, "case not yet initiated"; cursor-paginated.
  - AC3: Employees crossing the 18-month threshold without a case trigger an X.2 alert (`MSG-PS11-FORECAST-ALERT`) to the responsible Pension Officer.
  - AC4: Forecast excludes separated employees (RETIRED/DECEASED/RESIGNED/TERMINATED).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Retirement age from E34 (effective-dated, cadre/category). BR2: Read-only projection; never auto-creates a case. BR3: Mid-month attainment retires on month-end per policy.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_retirement_forecasts`, `pen_retirement_age_rules` (read), `employees` (PS01, read), `org_units` (read), `pen_separation_cases` (case_initiated flag).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/forecasts` | due-for-retirement list (cursor; filters horizon/org_unit/cadre) |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/forecasts:refresh` | recompute (delegates to `JOB-PS11-FORECAST`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/forecasts/{employeeId}` | one employee's projection |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Due-for-retirement worklist (Admin workspace) with horizon tabs, per-row "initiate case", alert badges, export; canonical empty/loading/error/no-permission/partial-data states (Foundation §3). Self-service shows the employee their own projected date (Me workspace).
- **Edge Cases:** DOB correction; cadre change altering retirement age (E34 lookup); extension-of-service order; deceased mid-horizon; leap-year/month-end arithmetic.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ForecastProjector`, `HorizonClassifier`, `JOB-PS11-FORECAST` (X.1), `AlertEmitter` (X.2) |
| Backend Flow | For each active employee → resolve retirement age (E34) → compute superannuation date → bucket → upsert forecast → emit threshold alerts via X.2 |
| Data Operations | Bulk upsert; index on `(tenant_id, horizon_bucket, org_unit_id)`, `projected_retirement_date` |
| Validation | DOB present (`VAL-DOB`); E34 rule resolved; exclude separated statuses |
| Authorization | `Authorization.check` (P02): Pension Officer/HR (org scope); employee reads own |
| State Changes & Side Effects | forecasts refreshed; X.2 threshold notifications; P05 audit on writes |
| Failure Handling | Missing DOB → exception list; E34 unresolved → flagged UNRESOLVED; job terminal failure → `MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL` |
| Dependencies | PS01, E34, X.1, X.2 |
| Test Guidance | Month-end arithmetic; cadre ages from E34; DOB-change recompute; alert threshold; separated-exclusion |

### FR-PS11-02 — Separation Case Management (All Separation Types) **(enhanced)**

- **Module:** PS11-F02
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to create and drive a separation case for any separation type and pension regime so the correct rules, workflow, and benefit set apply from the start.
- **Description:** Create a `pen_separation_cases` record selecting the type, derive the pension scheme (OPS/NPS/UPS), capture type-specific inputs (VRS notice, PS09 compulsory-retirement order ref, medical-board ref, death report ref, pending-proceedings flag), bind a PDA (carrying its disbursement model), and progress through the state machine with **maker-checker gates running on P01** (`WorkflowEngine.startInstance({ workflow_code: 'PS11_SEPARATION_CASE', subject_ref: case_id, … })`; the flow is a **W.1 configured flow definition**, SEQUENTIAL with a CONDITIONAL provisional-pension branch; SoD enforced by P01/P02). Type drives which downstream FRs are mandatory.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each type enforces required inputs (COMPULSORY_RETIREMENT → valid PS09 order; INVALIDATION → medical-board certificate; DEATH_IN_SERVICE → date of death + E26 family data).
  - AC2: Scheme auto-derived from DOJ vs cutover + UPS opt-in; override requires reason + P05 audit.
  - AC2a: If `proceedings_pending = true`, the case is routed (P01 CONDITIONAL stage) to the provisional-pension path (FR-PS11-22) and DCRG flagged for full withholding.
  - AC3: Only an authority distinct from the maker can sanction (SoD enforced by P01/P02 — multi-role INTERSECTION, no self-approval).
  - AC4: Resignation/dismissal paths suppress pension where rules disallow but still allow GPF/leave settlement.
  - AC5: At most one active case per employee (IR1).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Compulsory retirement only from a PS09 penalty order. BR2: Death-in-service auto-spawns family-pension (`enhanced_basis=IN_SERVICE`) and death-gratuity sub-flows. BR3: VRS requires minimum qualifying service and may add weightage. BR4: A case cannot skip the FR-PS11-18 gate or no-dues except via explicit anticipatory/provisional exception. BR5: UPS opt-in recorded once, irreversible per rule; scheme override P05-audited.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_separation_cases`, `pen_disbursing_authorities` (read), `pen_family_members` (read on death), `employees` (PS01, read), `service_register_events` (PS12, append on closure), `workflow_instances` (P01).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/cases` | create case (`Idempotency-Key` required — workflow-initiating) |

### FR-PS11-03 — Pre-Retirement Processing (SR Verification, No-Dues, Anticipatory Pension) **(enhanced)**

- **Module:** PS11-F03
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, SR Custodian (PS12), HR Admin, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to run SR verification, drive no-dues clearance, and authorise anticipatory pension 1–2 years ahead so benefits are ready before the retirement date and pension never breaks.
- **Description:** Orchestrate the lead pipeline: trigger the FR-PS11-18 completeness gate and request gap-free verification from **PS12** (SR Custodian certifies), coordinate no-dues clearance (P01 PARALLEL_ALL_OF checklist), and authorise **anticipatory pension** within rule limits (issuing an ANTICIPATORY PPO) when final pension cannot be sanctioned in time. Pending-proceedings cases use provisional pension (FR-PS11-22).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Case cannot advance to CALCULATION until the `pen_service_verifications` record is SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED (FR-PS11-18) **and** `qsr.sr_verified=true`.
  - AC2: No-dues is a checklist with per-item owner/status (P01 stages); case cannot reach PENDING_SANCTION until CLEARED (or anticipatory/provisional exception).
  - AC3: Anticipatory pension issues an ANTICIPATORY PPO within the configured cap, later superseded by the final PPO with adjustment.
  - AC4: Outstanding dues recorded and netted into terminal settlement, never silently ignored.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Anticipatory pension ≤ configured % of estimated pension; anticipatory gratuity withheld until no-dues. BR2: SR gaps condoned by E29 order before counting as qualifying. BR3: No-dues blocking items hold gratuity but not the basic anticipatory pension.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_separation_cases`, `pen_service_verifications` (gate), `pen_qualifying_service_records`, `service_register_events` (PS12, read/verify), `pen_ppo_records` (ANTICIPATORY), `pen_terminal_settlements` (recoveries).

### FR-PS11-04 — Qualifying Service Computation **(enhanced)**

- **Module:** PS11-F04
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, SR Custodian
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want qualifying service computed from verified service with non-qualifying spells deducted and counted prior service added so pension and gratuity use the legally correct service length.
- **Description:** Compute gross service joining→retirement/death, enumerate non-qualifying spells (from **PS03** leave/LWP events and **PS04** SR postings), deduct uncondoned spells, add structured counted prior/military service from E39, apply VRS weightage, and round to reckonable half-years per E36. Determines `meets_min_pension_service` (E35) routing FULL_PENSION vs SERVICE_GRATUITY. Produces an auditable, locked QSR. Runs only after the FR-PS11-18 record is signed off.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: `net_qualifying = gross − Σ(uncondoned non-qualifying days) + Σ(counted prior-service days)`; condoned spells (E29) count as qualifying.
  - AC2: Reckonable half-years rounded per E36; capped per E36.
  - AC3: Each non-qualifying spell traces to a source (PS03/PS04 event, PS09 order, or manual w/ justification) and is reason-code-attested in FR-PS11-18.
  - AC4: VRS weightage added only when rules permit and within cap.
  - AC4a: Counted prior service from E39 added only when `verified=true` and `pension_already_drawn=false`.
  - AC5: `meets_min_pension_service` set from E35; if false, FR-PS11-05 produces SERVICE_GRATUITY_ONLY. Record locks on verification; later changes require a new version.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: EOL on medical certificate may be qualifying; otherwise non-qualifying (attested in FR-18). BR2: Dies-non never qualifies. BR3: Min qualifying service via E35. BR4: Prior service counted distinctly from VRS weightage (`prior_service_days` vs `weightage_years`).

### FR-PS11-05 — Pension Calculation (OPS / NPS / UPS, Service Gratuity, NPS Defaults) **(enhanced — R2, R3)**

- **Module:** PS11-F05
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want pension computed under the correct regime — including service gratuity for short service, UPS assured payout, and NPS death/invalidation defaults — so every cohort is statutorily correct.
- **Description:** Branch by `benefit_outcome`: **OPS ≥10 yrs** = flat **50%** of emoluments base (from **PS10**); **<10 yrs** = no pension → SERVICE_GRATUITY (FR-07); **UPS opted-in** = assured payout ≈ 50% of last-12-month average pay with E35 guarantee; **NPS death/invalidation** = CCS-NPS Rules 2021 default; **NPS superannuation** = corpus/PRAN (from CRA over X.3) + indicative annuity/lump-sum (non-deterministic). A full `calc_trace` and `rule_version_ref` (FK) are persisted. Proportionate reduction for short service is removed.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: OPS basic pension = flat 50% of emoluments base for ≥10 years qualifying (no proportionate reduction).
  - AC1a: For <10 years, no monthly pension; routed to SERVICE_GRATUITY; `benefit_outcome=SERVICE_GRATUITY_ONLY`.
  - AC2: Emoluments method selectable (last-drawn / 10-month / beneficial-of-both / 12-month UPS) and snapshotted from **PS10**.
  - AC3: Statutory min/max (E35) enforced with flags.
  - AC4: NPS superannuation marked non-OPS; no defined-benefit pension fabricated; indicative figures excluded from determinism.
  - AC4a: NPS death-in-service/invalidation computes the CCS-NPS Rules 2021 OPS-equivalent default.
  - AC4b: UPS opted-in computes assured payout (~50% of 12-month average) with the UPS minimum guarantee.
  - AC5: Re-computation with identical inputs and the snapshotted rule version is identical; rule version recorded as FK.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Scheme from case `pension_scheme` + `ups_opted_in`. BR2: Emoluments exclude non-reckonable allowances. BR3: Age-based additional pension increments scheduled as future revisions (FR-13). BR4: SERVICE_GRATUITY branch mutually exclusive with FULL_PENSION (IR3a).
- **Data Model References:** `pen_pension_calculations`, `pen_qualifying_service_records` (read), E35/E30 (read), PS10 emoluments (read), `pen_gratuity_calculations` (SERVICE_GRATUITY handoff).

### FR-PS11-06 — Commutation of Pension **(enhanced — R11)**

- **Module:** PS11-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Retiring Employee (opt), Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a retiring employee, I want to commute a portion of my pension into a lump sum, with residual pension and restoration date correctly computed from the reduction date.
- **Description:** Capture the commutation option (fraction ≤ statutory max), resolve the factor by age-next-birthday from E31 (FK captured), compute commuted value = commuted × factor × 12, reduce monthly pension to residual from the reduction-effective date, and schedule restoration = reduction date + 15 yrs (applied by **`JOB-PS11-RESTORE`** on X.1). Handles migrated pensioners with unknown dates.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Commuted fraction bounded by statutory maximum (e.g. 40%); over-limit rejected.
  - AC2: Factor resolves from the effective E31 table by age-next-birthday (FK captured).
  - AC3: Commuted value, residual pension, reduction-effective date computed and shown with trace.
  - AC3a: `restoration_due_date = reduction_effective_date + 15 yrs`; `migrated_date_unknown=true` → manual review, not auto-scheduled.
  - AC4: Residual pension feeds the PPO; restoration scheduled and later applied (FR-12) restoring full basic.
  - AC5: Opting out leaves full basic pension and no commuted value.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Commutation requires medical fitness unless within the no-medical window post-retirement. BR2: Pension reduced from the date of receipt of commuted value; restoration is 15 yrs from that date. BR3: Commuted portion still attracts DA on the full basic per rule.

### FR-PS11-07 — Gratuity Computation (Retirement, Death & Service) **(enhanced — R2, Improvement 21)**

- **Module:** PS11-F07
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want retirement, death and service gratuity computed with the correct slabs and an auto-stepping statutory ceiling so the lump-sum benefit is accurate and within limits.
- **Description:** Compute retirement gratuity (¼ × emoluments × qualifying half-years, capped), death gratuity (service-length slabs), and service gratuity (<10-yr qualifying: one-time lump sum, no DCRG ceiling). The statutory ceiling resolves from E33 and auto-steps +25% whenever DA crosses each 50% threshold. Death/retirement gratuity apportioned to nominees (E21) for death cases.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Retirement gratuity uses capped half-years and the E33 ceiling; `payable=min(computed,ceiling)`.
  - AC2: Death gratuity applies the correct slab multiplier by service length.
  - AC2a: Service gratuity (service <10 yrs) computes the one-time lump sum with no DCRG ceiling; `gratuity_type=SERVICE_GRATUITY`.
  - AC3: Death gratuity apportioned per nominee shares totalling 100% (E21, `VAL-NOMINEE`).
  - AC4: Gratuity may be withheld pending no-dues or fully withheld pending Rule-9 proceedings (FR-22).
  - AC5: Ceiling-applied/withheld flags set; the E33 ceiling row used is captured (`ceiling_ref`).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Emoluments = basic + DA at retirement/death date. BR2: Half-years capped per E36. BR3: Statutory ceiling effective-dated (E33). BR3a: Ceiling auto-steps +25% per 50% DA threshold crossed (E33), no manual edit. BR4: No minimum-service bar for death gratuity.

### FR-PS11-08 — Family & Enhanced Family Pension **(enhanced — R1, R4, R14)**

- **Module:** PS11-F08
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want family pension computed at the correct path-specific rate to the statutorily-eligible family member(s) so bereaved families are paid accurately, including dual and twin cases.
- **Description:** Compute family pension at normal rate (e.g. 30%, E32) and, where eligible, enhanced rate (e.g. 50%) for a path-specific window driven by `enhanced_basis`: death-in-service → 10 years no age cap; death-after-retirement → 7 years or up to age 67 / would-be-superannuation, whichever earlier. Eligibility/hierarchy derive from the **E26 family-members register** by `statutory_rank` — never nominees. Supports dual family pension (E32 cap) and simultaneous twin/multiple eligible children (`concurrent_share_pct`). Maintains review dates and transfer to the next eligible member on cessation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Normal and enhanced amounts compute from emoluments × E32 rates.
  - AC2: Enhanced window computed from `enhanced_basis`: IN_SERVICE = +10 yrs, no age cap; AFTER_RETIREMENT = min(+7 yrs, age-67, would-be-superannuation). Steps down to normal automatically (scheduled).
  - AC2a: Applied window rule recorded in `enhanced_window_rule`; both step-downs tested.
  - AC3: Active recipient and hierarchy from E26 by `statutory_rank`; on cessation pension transfers to the next eligible member unless none remain.
  - AC4: Disabled-dependent members receive lifelong family pension per rule.
  - AC5: Both death-in-service and conversion-on-pensioner-death paths produce a family-pension record and FAMILY_PENSION PPO.
  - AC6: Dual family pension permitted (both spouses enterprise servants) subject to the E32 dual cap; twins/multiple children draw simultaneously per `concurrent_share_pct`=100%.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Enhanced rate = min(enhanced formula, would-be pension). BR1a: Window selection mandatory and path-driven (IR8a). BR2: Dual family pension and simultaneous twin/eligible-children shares allowed per rule (IR14). BR3: Remarriage/employment may cease eligibility except disabled children/widow. BR4: Recipient is the rule-defined family member (E26); nomination (E21) does not confer family-pension eligibility.

### FR-PS11-09 — Terminal Benefits & Final Settlement (with Tax/TDS) **(enhanced — R12)**

- **Module:** PS11-F09
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Payroll Officer (PS10)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a composite final settlement bringing together leave encashment, gratuity, commuted value, GPF, recoveries, and statutory tax/TDS so one-time dues are paid net of legitimate recoveries and correct tax.
- **Description:** Assemble the terminal settlement: leave encashment from **PS03** (× per-day emoluments, capped), gratuity (FR-07), commuted value (FR-06), GPF (FR-10), other dues, net legitimate recoveries within statutory protection, and compute tax/TDS (gratuity ₹20L cap, commuted-pension exemption, leave-encashment exemption, taxable totals, TDS, Section 89(1) relief). Produces gross, taxable, TDS, net-of-tax settlement for sanction and disbursement.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Leave encashment = min(encashable EL days, statutory cap) × per-day (basic+DA); shown as a line.
  - AC2: Gross = Σ components; net = gross − recoveries − TDS; each recovery traces to an order.
  - AC2a: Tax step computes per-component exempt/taxable splits, TDS, Section 89(1) relief, captured in `tax_breakdown`.
  - AC3: Recoveries cannot exceed statutory limits; excess deferred/flagged, never silently dropped.

### FR-PS11-10 — GPF Final Withdrawal

- **Module:** PS11-F10
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Payroll Officer (PS10)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want the GPF final balance with interest and advances adjusted so the provident-fund corpus is settled correctly at retirement or death.
- **Description:** Retrieve the GPF closing balance and contribution ledger from **PS10**, compute interest to settlement date (effective GPF rate), deduct outstanding advances, derive final payable, apportion to nominees (E21) for death cases, and route for authorisation. NPS/UPS cases use NPS exit, not GPF.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Final payable = closing balance + interest-to-date − outstanding advances. AC2: Interest at the effective GPF rate. AC3: Death cases apportion to nominees totalling 100% (E21). AC4: GPF withdrawal requires authorisation distinct from the maker (SoD). AC5: GPF only for GPF/OPS subscribers; NPS/UPS routed to NPS exit.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: GPF closing balance is the PS10 system of record. BR2: Interest rate effective-dated. BR3: Unrecovered advances are mandatory deductions.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_gpf_final_settlements`, PS10 GPF ledger (read), `pen_nominees_beneficiaries` (E21, read).

### FR-PS11-11 — PPO Generation & Digital PPO **(enhanced — R10, Improvement 20)**

- **Module:** PS11-F11
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (prepare), Sanctioning Authority (authorise)
- **User Story:** As a Sanctioning Authority, I want to issue a registry-numbered PPO — service, family, anticipatory, provisional, or revised — so the pensioner's entitlement is formally authorised, transmitted to the PDA, and delivered digitally.
- **Description:** Generate the PPO from sanctioned figures, allocate a unique `ppo_no`, render a digital PPO via the platform **DocumentGen** service (signed artefact in `documents`/PS13), bind a PDA, for PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF carry basic + relief-formula reference, and produce pensioner/disbursing halves. Supports SERVICE_PENSION, FAMILY_PENSION, ANTICIPATORY, PROVISIONAL (Rule 9), REVISED. On P01 authorisation, the e-PPO is pushed to DigiLocker (over X.3, FR-24) and linked to Aadhaar/PRAN.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: PPO issues only when the case is SANCTIONED (or anticipatory/provisional authorised).
  - AC2: `ppo_no` unique and registry-allocated; a REVISED PPO references and supersedes exactly one ACTIVE PPO.
  - AC3: e-PPO generated as a signed artefact (DocumentGen), available to self-service and delivered to DigiLocker (FR-24).
  - AC4: PPO carries basic pension, commuted portion, residual, effective-from, PDA binding, and (for PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF) the relief-formula reference.
  - AC5: Authorising the PPO creates/links the pensioner master record (FR-12).
  - AC6: A PROVISIONAL PPO links to `pen_provisional_pension_records` and is superseded by the final PPO on proceedings conclusion.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Anticipatory/provisional PPOs superseded by the final PPO with adjustment. BR2: Authoriser ≠ preparer (SoD via P01/P02). BR3: PPO effective-from = pension commencement date. BR4: For PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF the PPO carries basic + relief formula; for M11_COMPUTES_FULL the disbursement carries the full computed amount.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_ppo_records`, `pen_pension_calculations`, `pen_commutation_records`, `pen_family_pension_records`, `pen_provisional_pension_records`, `pen_disbursing_authorities`, `pen_pensioners`, `documents` (PS13).

### FR-PS11-12 — Pensioner Master & Lifecycle Management **(enhanced — R9 link, R11)**

- **Module:** PS11-F12
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Pensioner/Family Pensioner (self-service), Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a pensioner master that tracks life certificates, restoration, family-pension conversion, and proactive death/fraud signals so the pensioner is correctly maintained for life and beyond.
- **Description:** Maintain `pen_pensioners` from PPO authorisation: capture annual LC/DLC (verified over X.3 against Jeevan Pramaan; LC reminders via **`JOB-PS11-LC-REMIND`**), suspend disbursement on overdue LC, restore the commuted portion at reduction-date+15yr (**`JOB-PS11-RESTORE`**), and on a self-pensioner death convert to family pension (E26-driven, FR-08, `enhanced_basis=AFTER_RETIREMENT`). Consumes proactive death-detection signals (FR-20) and links any overpayment recovery (E38).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: LC has a yearly due date; overdue beyond grace sets `SUSPENDED_NO_LC` and holds disbursement.
  - AC2: Submitting/verifying an LC reactivates the pensioner and releases held pension with arrear.
  - AC3: At restoration due date (reduction+15yr), the commuted portion is restored; `current_monthly_pension` reflects full basic.
  - AC4: On `date_of_death` for a self-pensioner, the system spawns family-pension conversion (E26/FR-08) and a FAMILY_PENSION PPO, moving the pensioner to CONVERTED_TO_FAMILY.
  - AC5: Pensioner contact/bank self-updates route through P01 maker-checker and pass pre-credit account verification (FR-14) before disbursement uses them.
  - AC6: A death detected via FR-20 triggers conversion and, if pension was drawn after death, opens an E38 recovery row.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: LC grace period configurable. BR2: Restoration applies only to the original pensioner. BR3: Family-pension conversion uses the E26 hierarchy. BR4: Late-reported death reconciles drawn-after-death pension into E38 recovery.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_pensioners`, `pen_life_certificates`, `pen_commutation_records` (restoration), `pen_family_pension_records`, `pen_family_members` (E26), `pen_ppo_records`, `pen_overpayment_recoveries` (E38).

| PATCH | `/api/v1/pension/pensioners/{id}` | update bank/contact (P01 maker-checker + verification) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Pensioner 360: pension summary, LC status with due/overdue badges and a plain-language LC calendar (FR-15/§11), restoration countdown, conversion history, death-signal panel (FR-20), overpayment-recovery panel (E38), bank/contact (masked reveal); self-service LC submission with fallback and grievance entry.
- **Edge Cases:** Restoration coinciding with a DA revision (ordering §16.9); death reported late (E38 recovery); LC submitted just after suspension; family pensioner's own death (next E26 member); fraudulent LC detection; death detected by FR-20 before family reports it.

### FR-PS11-13 — Pension Revision (DA & Pay-Commission) **(enhanced — R6, R13)**

- **Module:** PS11-F13
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), SysAdmin (rule tables)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to apply DA and pay-commission revisions across the pensioner population under a deterministic application order and the correct disbursement model so every pensioner's pension stays current with arrears computed correctly.
- **Description:** Run revision batches as **`JOB-PS11-PENSION-RUN`** (X.1; per-period run key, period lock, backoff ×3) branching on the PDA disbursement model: **M11_COMPUTES_FULL** → recompute the full monthly figure, compute old vs new + arrears, instruct exact amounts (FR-14); **PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF (CPPC)** → issue a relief order (new DA% / pay-commission basis) for the bank to apply, and reconcile. When multiple events share an effective date for one pensioner, apply strictly in the §16.9 order. Also schedules age-based additional pension increments (80/85/90/95/100).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A DA-revision batch recomputes Dearness Relief for M11_COMPUTES_FULL pensioners as of the effective date; for PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF it issues a relief order and marks lines for reconciliation.
  - AC2: A pay-commission batch re-fixes basic pension and computes arrears from the effective date.
  - AC3: Old vs new and arrear amounts computed per pensioner with trace; batch requires P01 approval before APPLY.
  - AC4: Applied revisions are immutable (P05); corrections create a new batch.
  - AC5: Age-based additional pension increments auto-apply on the milestone birthday.
  - AC6: When ≥2 events share an effective date, they apply in the §16.9 order; the applied order is recorded in `calc_trace` (tested invariant).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: DA/pay-commission parameters are effective-dated rule-table rows (E30, SysAdmin-approved via config cascade). BR2: Family pensioners revised by the same batch. BR3: Arrears netting respects prior over-payment (E38). BR4: Revision branch determined by `pensioners.disbursement_model`.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_revisions`, `pen_pensioners`, `pen_da_relief_rates` (E30), `pen_disbursing_authorities` (model), `pen_disbursements` (arrears), `pen_overpayment_recoveries` (netting).

### FR-PS11-14 — Treasury / Bank / PDA Integration (with Pre-Credit Verification) **(enhanced — R6, R8, R15)**

- **Module:** PS11-F14
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (prepare), Sanctioning Authority (authorise), Treasury/PDA/Bank
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to transmit authorised payment instructions to the disbursing authority over a defined interface, verify accounts before first credit, and reconcile acknowledgements so pensioners are paid correctly and a wrong-account payment is prevented.
- **Description:** Produce disbursement instruction batches (`JOB-PS11-DISBURSE` on X.1) per the **X.3 payload-versioned PDA contract (§8.6)** for first pension, monthly pension (per model), arrears, gratuity, commuted value, GPF, terminal benefits; run pre-credit account verification (penny-drop / name-IFSC / NPCI mapper, E42, over X.3) before the first credit and block on mismatch; transfer PPO authorisation; track transmission/acknowledgement using the contract's ack schema and error taxonomy; reconcile paid/failed lines and raise exceptions/grievances; retry/re-route failures. **All external calls go through the X.3 framework — idempotent, circuit-broken, payload-versioned, credentials from P04.**
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Only AUTHORISED instructions (SoD) are transmitted.
  - AC1a: No FIRST_PENSION/TERMINAL/GRATUITY/GPF/COMMUTED_VALUE line is transmitted to an account unless its `pen_bank_account_verifications` row is PASSED; mismatch blocks the line (IR16).
  - AC2: Each line ties to a PPO/pensioner/case and an amount; batch totals reconcile to the sum of lines.
  - AC3: Acknowledgements update `instruction_status` per the §8.6 ack schema; failed lines raise exceptions/grievances using the bank/treasury error taxonomy.
  - AC4: First pension instruction generated to commence on the pension start date (no break).
  - AC5: Idempotent transmission (X.3 idempotency + `Idempotency-Key`) prevents duplicate payments.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Invalid/missing bank or PDA binding blocks the line. BR1a: Account verification (E42) must be PASSED before first credit; re-verification on bank-detail change. BR2: Failed lines retried (X.3 circuit-breaker/backoff) or re-routed, never silently abandoned. BR3: Monthly pension respects LC suspension and the disbursement model.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_disbursements`, `pen_bank_account_verifications` (E42), `pen_disbursing_authorities` (E37, contract+model), `pen_ppo_records`, `pen_pensioners`, `pen_terminal_settlements`, `pen_revisions` (arrears); `integration_credentials` (P04).

### FR-PS11-15 — Retirement Self-Service Portal & Benefit Estimators / What-If **(enhanced — R16)**

- **Module:** PS11-F15
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee / Retiring Employee, Pensioner (self-service, Me workspace)
- **User Story:** As a retiring employee, I want to see my retirement journey in plain language, estimate my benefits as outcomes I understand, and submit my forms online so I can plan and act without visiting an office.
- **Description:** A self-service portal (Me workspace) with a 3-state plain-language tracker (In progress / Approved / Being paid) over the internal state machine, an outcome-framed benefit estimator / what-if, option submission (commutation, nominee, family-member, bank) via **P01 maker-checker (W.2 forms)**, document upload, an LC annual calendar, and a step-by-step bereavement/death-reporting guide. Pensioners reuse the portal for e-PPO (incl. DigiLocker), LC, and grievances. Mobile-responsive, WCAG 2.1 AA, canonical UI states.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Estimators label results indicative/non-binding (`is_binding=false`) and never write to the live case.
  - AC2: What-if can vary commutation fraction, emoluments, and date, recomputing all headline figures, expressed as plain-language outcomes.
  - AC3: Submitted options flow into the case via P01 maker-checker, not directly into sanctioned data.
  - AC4: The employee sees a 3-state citizen tracker; the internal state machine is not mirrored; legal terms retained only where statutory, with plain-language explanations.
  - AC5: All self-service screens cover empty/loading/error/success/permission states (no skeleton placeholders; Foundation §3).
  - AC6: An LC annual calendar shows when the LC is due, the four submission options, and what happens if missed.
  - AC7: A bereavement guide walks a family member through reporting a death and claiming family pension, mapped to FR-12/FR-08.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Estimators use current rule tables but flag that final figures depend on verified service and emoluments. BR2: Self-service writes require identity/MFA (P02) and route to Pension Officer review (P01).
- **Data Model References:** `pen_benefit_estimates`, `pen_separation_cases` (status read; option submissions), `pen_nominees_beneficiaries`, `pen_family_members` (E26 declarations), `pen_retirement_forecasts` (read).

- **User Story:** As a pensioner, I want to raise and track grievances so issues like non-receipt, wrong amount, or unapplied revision are resolved within an SLA.
- **Description:** Grievance intake (categorised, W.2 form), routing, **SLA tracking with escalation on P01 SLA timers**, linkage to case/PPO/disbursement, and resolution with P05 audit. Auto-creates grievances from disbursement failures (FR-14) and surfaces ageing/SLA-breach analytics (to PS14).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Captures category, description, priority, links to pensioner/case. AC2: SLA due date by category/priority; breach escalates to the Sanctioning Authority (P01 escalation → X.2). AC3: Disbursement failures auto-create a grievance linked to the failed line. AC4: Resolution requires a recorded action and notifies the pensioner; reopen supported. AC5: Status follows the state machine with full P05 audit.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: SLA matrix configurable (W.1/SLA setting). BR2: Critical grievances (payment-not-received) auto-prioritise. BR3: Closure requires resolution text (`VAL-COMMENT`).

### FR-PS11-17 — Forecasting & Pension-Liability Analytics

- **Module:** PS11-F17
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Department Head, Auditor
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want pension-liability and processing analytics so I can plan budgets, staffing, and SLA compliance.
- **Description:** Analytics over the retirement pipeline and pensioner population, feeding **PS14** (PrimeSoft M16 analytics): due-for-retirement workload; projected pension-liability (DA/pay-commission scenarios); benefit-cost breakdown; processing SLA & ageing; grievance trends; and audit-objection ageing (FR-23). Read-only aggregations from PS11 entities, **scoped per the user's RBAC entitlement (P02)**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** AC1: Liability projection aggregates `pensioners.current_monthly_pension` × 12 plus pipeline cases, with scenario sliders. AC2: Workload by horizon/org/cadre. AC3: SLA analytics compute first-pension-on-time rate and average stage durations. AC4: All analytics respect org-unit row-level scope (P02); export honours permissions. AC5: Figures reconcile to underlying records.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Read-only. BR2: Scenario projections labelled assumptions. BR3: Auditor sees all (Org-Admin read); managers see own scope.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_retirement_forecasts`, `pen_pensioners`, `pen_separation_cases`, `pen_pension_calculations`, `pen_gratuity_calculations`, `pen_family_pension_records`, `pen_grievances`, `pen_audit_objections` (all read).

| GET | `/api/v1/pension/analytics/workload` | due-for-retirement workload |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/analytics/sla` | processing SLA & ageing |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Analytics dashboard (in PS14) with liability projection, workload, SLA gauges, benefit-cost composition, grievance trend, audit-objection ageing; export with scope enforcement.
- **Edge Cases:** Sparse data for small units; scenario extremes; mid-year pay-commission; scope-restricted export; very large pensioner population performance.

### FR-PS11-18 — Service-Record Completeness & Discrepancy Resolution **(new — R5; GAP enterprise-specific engine on P01/P05)**

- **Module:** PS11-F18
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), SR Custodian (PS12), Payroll Officer (PS10), Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a rigorous service-record completeness gate that resolves every discrepancy and attests every non-qualifying spell before any benefit is computed, so determinism defends correct numbers.
- **Description:** Before CALCULATION, build a `pen_service_verifications` (E27) record over the full service span: detect gaps/discrepancies into a discrepancy ledger (E28); require per-non-qualifying-spell reason-code attestation; record condonations as orders in a condonation register (E29); and require **multi-point sign-off (SR Custodian + Payroll Officer + Pension Officer) as a P01 PARALLEL_ALL_OF flow**. CALCULATION is gated on this record being SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED with zero open discrepancies and all spells attested (IR2a). This is a net-new statutory engine authoring its own business logic but running on P01 (the sign-off flow) and P05 (immutable audit).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A `pen_service_verifications` record enumerates every gap/discrepancy as an E28 ledger line with type, period, source (PS03/PS04/PS09/PS10/PS12), and required resolution.
  - AC2: Each non-qualifying spell must be reason-code-attested before sign-off; unattested spells block sign-off.
  - AC3: Condonations are recorded as E29 orders (order no, date, authority, document) and linked to the resolving discrepancy.
  - AC4: Sign-off requires SR Custodian + Payroll Officer + Pension Officer attestations (P01 PARALLEL_ALL_OF); `signoff_complete=true` sets SIGNED_OFF then LOCKED.
  - AC5: A case cannot enter CALCULATION unless the record is SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED, `discrepancy_open_count=0`, and `spells_attested_count=spells_total_count` (IR2a).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Free-text resolution is not accepted for condonation — an E29 order is mandatory. BR2: Reason codes come from the controlled list. BR3: Re-opening a locked verification creates a new version and re-gates downstream calcs.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_service_verifications` (E27), `pen_service_discrepancies` (E28), `pen_condonation_orders` (E29), `pen_non_qualifying_spells` (attestation), `service_register_events` (PS12, read), PS03/PS04/PS09/PS10 (read).

| POST | `/api/v1/pension/cases/{id}/service-verification:signoff` | multi-point sign-off (P01) → SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Verification workbench: discrepancy ledger grid, spell-attestation panel with reason-code dropdowns, condonation-order register with document upload, a three-signature sign-off bar (P01 PARALLEL_ALL_OF), and a prominent gate-status banner showing whether CALCULATION is unblocked.
- **Edge Cases:** Legacy spell with no reason code; condonation order on paper only (scan + register); overlapping discrepancies; sign-off attempted with open lines (blocked); new evidence after lock (re-version); prior-service discrepancy (links E39).

### FR-PS11-19 — Effective-Dated Pension Rule-Table Management **(new — R7, Improvement 21; on the config cascade)**

- **Module:** PS11-F19
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (Org Admin — maintain), Sanctioning Authority / Rule Approver (approve), Auditor (read)
- **User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want first-class, effective-dated, versioned rule tables for every benefit parameter so the benefit engines compute against real, approved, auditable rows.
- **Description:** Manage the rule-table entities E30–E36 through the **platform configuration cascade (`platform default → tenant → entity → employee`)** and versioning, each effective-dated (staged via `VAL-EFFECTIVE` / `JOB-PS11-EFFDATE`) with a `DRAFT→APPROVED→EFFECTIVE→SUPERSEDED` lifecycle and **SoD (maintainer ≠ approver) enforced by P01/P02**. Every benefit calculation's `rule_version_ref` is a FK to the exact EFFECTIVE row used (IR17). The gratuity ceiling auto-steps +25% per 50% DA threshold crossed (E33), driven by E30.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each rule table supports effective-dated rows with non-overlapping windows per key; a new effective row supersedes the prior.
  - AC2: A rule row follows DRAFT→APPROVED→EFFECTIVE→SUPERSEDED; only an approver distinct from the maintainer can APPROVE (SoD, P01/P02).
  - AC3: Benefit engines resolve the EFFECTIVE row for the relevant date and capture its id as `rule_version_ref` (FK); SUPERSEDED rows remain referenced by historic calcs (immutability, IR17, P05).
  - AC4: The gratuity ceiling (E33) auto-computes `current_effective_ceiling` by stepping +25% each time DA (E30) crosses each 50% threshold — no manual edit.
  - AC5: Missing/inactive rule rows for a required date raise `ERR-PS11-RULE-NOT-EFFECTIVE` to the calling engine.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: SysAdmin maintains; a distinct approver approves (SoD); no self-approve. BR2: Enterprise-notification reference captured per row. BR3: No row deleted once referenced; it is SUPERSEDED (soft-delete only).
- **Data Model References:** E30–E36 (`pen_da_relief_rates`..`pen_rounding_rules`).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/rules/{table}` | list rows (filter by effective date) |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/rules/{table}` | create DRAFT row |

| GET | `/api/v1/pension/rules/{table}/resolve?asOf=YYYY-MM-DD` | resolve the EFFECTIVE row for a date |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Rule-table admin (Admin workspace) with table selector, effective-dated row grid, a P01 maker-checker approval flow, a version diff view, and a gratuity-ceiling panel showing the DA-driven auto-step; read-only for Auditor.
- **Edge Cases:** Overlapping windows (rejected); approving as the maintainer (blocked by SoD); a calc referencing a SUPERSEDED row (allowed for history); DA crossing two thresholds at once; retro-effective row affecting pending calcs.

### FR-PS11-20 — Proactive Death Detection & Overpayment Recovery **(new — R9; over X.3)**

- **Module:** PS11-F20
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority, Auditor
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want proactive detection of pensioner deaths and payment anomalies plus a structured recovery-from-estate workflow so pension is not drawn into a deceased pensioner's account for months.
- **Description:** Run a **death-registry / Aadhaar-DBT reconciliation job (`JOB-PS11-DEATHRECON` on X.1, calls over X.3 with P04 credentials)** and payment-anomaly/dormancy detection against the pensioner population. On a confirmed death where pension was drawn after the date of death, open an E38 recovery row, halt disbursement, trigger family-pension conversion (FR-12/FR-08), and drive recovery from family pension / estate / legal heir with a "pension drawn after death" exception report.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A scheduled job reconciles pensioner records against death-registry/Aadhaar-DBT signals (X.3) and flags probable deaths with a confidence/source.
  - AC2: Anomaly detection flags dormancy/abnormal patterns for review.
  - AC3: On confirmed death with post-death drawal, an E38 row is created, disbursement held, FR-12 conversion triggered.
  - AC4: Recovery supports FROM_FAMILY_PENSION / FROM_ESTATE / FROM_LEGAL_HEIR / WRITE_OFF, each P05-audited; partial recovery tracked.
  - AC5: A "pension drawn after death" exception report lists all open post-death drawals with ageing.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Detection signals advisory until confirmed. BR2: Recovery-from-estate follows the statutory order. BR3: DBT/registry data processed under DPDP purpose-limitation, retained only as needed.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_overpayment_recoveries` (E38), `pen_pensioners` (death fields), `pen_family_pension_records` (conversion), `pen_disbursements` (hold); `integration_credentials` (P04).
- **API References:**

| POST | `/api/v1/pension/overpayments/{id}:recover` | record recovery (mode, amount) |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/reports/drawn-after-death` | exception report |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Death-detection console with flag queue (source, confidence), confirm/dismiss, an overpayment-recovery workspace, and the drawn-after-death exception report with ageing.
- **Edge Cases:** False-positive registry match (dismiss with reason); death confirmed long after the fact; pensioner already converted (recover from family pension); legal-heir dispute; write-off approval; signal source unavailable (X.3 circuit-break, job degrades gracefully).

| Validation | Confirmation before recovery; statutory recovery order; DPDP retention |
| Authorization | Officer confirm/recover; Authority approve write-off; Auditor read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | E38 IDENTIFIED→NOTIFIED→UNDER_RECOVERY→RECOVERED/WRITTEN_OFF/LEGAL; disbursement hold; conversion trigger; P05 audit |

### FR-PS11-21 — PDA Registry & Disbursement Model + X.3 Interface Contract **(new — R6, R8)**

- **Module:** PS11-F21
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (maintain), Pension Officer, Treasury/PDA/Bank (integration), Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As an administrator, I want each Pension Disbursing Authority registered with an explicit disbursement model and a defined X.3 interface contract so FR-13/FR-14 behave correctly per PDA and the longest-lead integration is not a launch-blocker.
- **Description:** Maintain `pen_disbursing_authorities` (E37) with `pda_disbursement_model` (M11_COMPUTES_FULL vs PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF), interface type (FILE_SFTP/REST_API on **X.3**), the §8.6 payload-versioned field list and ack schema, the bank/treasury error taxonomy, retry/re-route (X.3 circuit-breaker), penny-drop capability, **credentials from P04**, and a sandbox-certification flag. The model drives FR-13 and FR-14. Opening and certifying each PDA contract is a week-1 parallel workstream (§13).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each PDA records model, interface type, payload contract version, ack schema, penny-drop capability, and its P04 credential ref.
  - AC2: FR-13/FR-14 branch on `pda_disbursement_model`; a PDA cannot go live (`status=ACTIVE`) until `sandbox_certified=true`.
  - AC3: The X.3 interface contract (§8.6) defines the disbursement field list, ack schema, and bank/treasury error taxonomy; transmissions conform to the payload contract version.
  - AC4: Retry/re-route semantics configured per PDA and honoured by FR-14 (X.3).
  - AC5: Changing a PDA's model or contract is P05-audited and re-certified in sandbox before taking effect.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: SysAdmin maintains; Authority approves go-live after sandbox certification. BR2: A pensioner/PPO bound to a PDA inherits its model (denormalised to `pensioners.disbursement_model`). BR3: No production transmission to an uncertified PDA. BR4: Credentials never inline — always via P04 `integration_credentials`.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_disbursing_authorities` (E37), `pen_ppo_records`/`pen_pensioners`/`pen_disbursements` (binding), §8.6 contract, `integration_credentials` (P04).

| POST | `/api/v1/pension/pdas/{id}:activate` | go-live (requires certification) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** PDA registry with model badges, interface/contract version, penny-drop capability, sandbox-certification status, activate gate; contract-field reference (§8.6) link.
- **Edge Cases:** PDA changing from treasury to CPPC (model change, re-certify); contract version bump; uncertified PDA bound to a case; mixed-model pensioner migration; re-route to an alternate PDA on persistent failure.

### FR-PS11-22 — Provisional Pension (Rule 9 — Pending Proceedings) **(new — R10)**

- **Module:** PS11-F22
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Disciplinary Authority (PS09)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a first-class provisional-pension path for retirees with pending departmental/judicial proceedings so they are paid a provisional pension while DCRG is fully withheld until the proceedings conclude.
- **Description:** When `proceedings_pending=true`, create a `pen_provisional_pension_records` (E41) with a provisional monthly pension and fully-withheld DCRG, issue a PROVISIONAL PPO (FR-11), and pay the provisional pension to avoid a break. On proceedings conclusion (**PS09** linkage), regularise to a final pension/PPO (release withheld DCRG) or apply the decided recovery — never silently release DCRG before conclusion.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A case with pending proceedings produces an E41 row and a PROVISIONAL PPO; provisional pension payable from commencement (no break).
  - AC2: DCRG fully withheld (`dcrg_withheld=true`, amount captured) and excluded from terminal settlement payout until conclusion.
  - AC3: On conclusion, `conclusion_outcome` ∈ {EXONERATED, PENALTY_NO_RECOVERY, PENALTY_WITH_RECOVERY} drives regularisation: EXONERATED/PENALTY_NO_RECOVERY → release DCRG and issue final PPO superseding the provisional; PENALTY_WITH_RECOVERY → apply recovery then release the balance.
  - AC4: The PS09 proceedings reference is mandatory; the linkage guard prevents final sanction/DCRG release while proceedings are ACTIVE.
  - AC5: Provisional pension later adjusted against the final pension with arrears/recovery.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: DCRG release impossible while E41 `status=ACTIVE`. BR2: Provisional pension amount per rule (typically the would-be pension). BR3: Conclusion must reference the PS09 decision.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_provisional_pension_records` (E41), `pen_separation_cases` (proceedings flags), `pen_ppo_records` (PROVISIONAL), `pen_gratuity_calculations` (DCRG withheld), `pen_terminal_settlements` (exclusion).
- **API References:**

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Provisional-pension panel showing proceedings reference/status, provisional monthly amount, fully-withheld DCRG, a conclusion action with outcome selector, and the regularisation/recovery preview; PROVISIONAL badge on the PPO composer.
- **Edge Cases:** Proceedings prolonged for years; employee dies during proceedings (family pension + DCRG handling); exoneration with arrears; penalty with partial recovery; proceedings under appeal; anticipatory→provisional conversion.

### FR-PS11-23 — Audit Objection Management **(new — Improvement 19; on P05)**

- **Module:** PS11-F23
- **Primary Role(s):** Auditor / AG, Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As an Auditor, I want AG/internal-audit objections against pension cases tracked from raise to closure with linkage to the case and calculation trace so the audit-objection-traceability goal is a built capability.
- **Description:** Capture audit objections (`pen_audit_objections`, E40) raised by AG/internal audit/treasury against a case/PPO/pensioner, linked to the disputed `calc_trace`; route to the Pension Officer for response within an SLA (P01 SLA timer); record the outcome (accepted-and-corrected via a linked revision, dropped, recovery raised, settled); surface ageing/closure analytics (FR-17, §12). The Auditor role maps to **Org-Admin read + P05 query entitlement** — no parallel write role.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An objection captures source, linked case/PPO/pensioner, the disputed `calc_trace` reference, and objection text.
  - AC2: An SLA due date is set (P01); the objection routes to the responsible Pension Officer with escalation on breach.
  - AC3: A response is recorded; the outcome drives closure — ACCEPTED_CORRECTED links a `pen_revisions` correction; DROPPED closes with rationale; RECOVERY_RAISED links an E38 recovery.
  - AC4: Objection status follows RAISED→UNDER_RESPONSE→RESPONDED→ACCEPTED/DROPPED→CLOSED with full P05 audit.
  - AC5: Open objections are visible on the case and in the Audit & Compliance Register (§12).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Closure requires a recorded outcome and rationale. BR2: A correction is applied only through the amendment/revision workflow (never a silent edit — enforced by P05 immutability). BR3: Auditor raises; Officer responds; Authority approves corrective revision.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_audit_objections` (E40), `pen_separation_cases`, `pen_ppo_records`, `pen_pensioners`, `pen_revisions` (correction), `pen_overpayment_recoveries` (recovery link).

| POST | `/api/v1/pension/audit-objections/{id}:respond` | record response |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/audit-objections/{id}:close` | close with outcome |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Audit-objection inbox with SLA timers, source/priority, linked case/PPO/trace context, response form, outcome selector (revision/recovery linkage), ageing/closure dashboard; Auditor-facing tracker.
- **Edge Cases:** Objection on a closed case; objection requiring a rule re-interpretation (escalate); objection withdrawn by audit; multiple objections on one case; objection leading to recovery from a deceased pensioner's estate (E38).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `AuditObjectionService`, P01 `SLATimer`, `OutcomeResolver` (revision/recovery linkage) |
| Backend Flow | Raise → set SLA → route → respond → resolve outcome (link revision/recovery) → close |

### FR-PS11-24 — Digital Delivery & DigiLocker / DBT Linkage **(new — Improvement 20; over X.3)**

- **Module:** PS11-F24
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Pensioner (self-service), System Administrator
- **User Story:** As a pensioner, I want my signed e-PPO and revision orders delivered to DigiLocker and my PPO linked to my Aadhaar/PRAN so I have authoritative, portable digital access to my pension documents.
- **Description:** On PPO authorisation (FR-11) and revision-order issue (FR-13), **push the signed e-PPO/revision order to DigiLocker over X.3** (idempotent, circuit-broken, payload-versioned, credentials from P04) as an issued document, record the DigiLocker reference, and link the PPO to the pensioner's Aadhaar/PRAN for DBT and death-reconciliation (FR-20). Provide a resilient retrying delivery channel (X.3 retry queue) with a self-service fallback download. The pre-retirement workflow is benchmarked against *Bhavishya* (§13).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An authorised e-PPO is pushed to DigiLocker (X.3); `digilocker_pushed=true` and `digilocker_ref` recorded.
  - AC2: Revision orders are similarly delivered to the pensioner's DigiLocker.
  - AC3: The PPO is linked to Aadhaar/PRAN (`aadhaar_masked`/`pran`, encrypted, masked by P02) for DBT and FR-20 reconciliation.
  - AC4: DigiLocker push is non-blocking — failure queues an X.3 retry and does not block PPO authorisation; a self-service fallback download is always available.
  - AC5: Delivery status is visible to the pensioner and officer.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Only signed, authorised artefacts are delivered. BR2: Aadhaar/PRAN stored encrypted, masked, access-logged (DPDP). BR3: Delivery failures retried with backoff (X.3); never silently dropped.
- **Data Model References:** `pen_ppo_records` (digilocker fields), `pen_pensioners` (aadhaar/pran), `documents` (PS13, signed e-PPO), `pen_revisions` (orders); `integration_credentials` (P04).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/ppos/{id}:deliver-digilocker` | push e-PPO to DigiLocker (X.3) |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/revisions/{id}:deliver-digilocker` | push revision order |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/ppos/{id}/delivery-status` | delivery status |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/pensioners/{id}:link-aadhaar-pran` | link Aadhaar/PRAN |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Delivery panel on the PPO composer and pensioner 360 showing DigiLocker delivery status (delivered/queued/failed-retrying), Aadhaar/PRAN linkage status (masked), fallback download button; pensioner self-service shows "Available in DigiLocker".
- **Edge Cases:** DigiLocker outage (X.3 queue + retry); pensioner without DigiLocker/Aadhaar (fallback download, manual linkage later); Aadhaar mismatch; revision order delivery for a converted family pensioner; re-delivery after a REVISED PPO supersession.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `DigiLockerPublisher` (X.3), `AadhaarPRANLinker`, `DeliveryRetryQueue` (X.3) |
| Backend Flow | On PPO/revision authorisation → render signed artefact (DocumentGen) → push to DigiLocker (X.3) → record ref → link Aadhaar/PRAN → on failure enqueue X.3 retry |
| Data Operations | Update ppo digilocker fields; pensioner aadhaar/pran; delivery-status log |
| Validation | Signed artefact only; encryption/masking (P02); retry on failure |
| Authorization | Officer/system deliver; Pensioner read own; SysAdmin config |
| State Changes & Side Effects | digilocker_pushed set; X.3 retry queue; X.2 notifications; P05 audit |
| Failure Handling | DigiLocker down → X.3 queue + backoff (non-blocking); Aadhaar mismatch → flag for manual linkage |
| Dependencies | FR-11, FR-13, FR-20, DocumentGen/PS13, X.3, P04; external DigiLocker/UIDAI/CRA |
| Test Guidance | e-PPO + revision delivery; ref capture; Aadhaar/PRAN linkage; non-blocking failure + retry; fallback download |

## 7. UI Requirements

All screens implement the **platform canonical UI-state standard** (Foundation §3): empty / loading (skeleton, no layout shift) / error (inline `ERR-*` id + retry, never a raw 500) / no-permission (gating menu hidden; deep-link → `ERR-FORBIDDEN`, not a 404 leak) / partial-data (render authorised, mask the rest per RBAC). PII/financial fields render **masked on serialization by P02** with the `E·AR` request-change pattern for sensitive edits. Screens live in the **Me / My Team / Admin** workspaces per RBAC role holdings. The shared component vocabulary (inline-edit field, effective-dated field, masked field, multi-step wizard, list+filter+bulk-action toolbar, approval action bar with P01 stage aliases, attachment control `VAL-FILE`, comment box `VAL-COMMENT`, date/effective-date picker, read-only audit-trail panel) is reused — not re-authored.

| Pension Analytics | Admin / Manager/Officer/Auditor (in PS14) | liability projection, workload, SLA gauges, benefit-cost, grievance trend, audit-objection ageing | empty, loaded, scope-restricted |

**Global UI requirements:** WCAG 2.1 AA; responsive breakpoints 375/768/1280 px, touch targets ≥ 44×44 px; keyboard navigation & visible focus; dark mode; mobile-first self-service; money/bank/PAN/Aadhaar/PRAN **masked by P02** with audited reveal; amounts/dates per locale (`DD-MMM-YYYY`); the five canonical states on every screen; plain-language, compassionate flows for death-in-service/family-pension/bereavement; the citizen surface shows a **3-state tracker**, never the internal state machine; **no skeleton placeholders in production**.

## 8. API & Integration

### 8.1 Conventions (platform — Foundation §1)

REST under **`/api/v1`**; JSON; **JWT bearer carrying resolved roles/entity scope, enforced per request by P02 (`Authorization.check`)**; **five-dimension row-level scoping at the data layer** (an unscoped query is rejected); **cursor pagination only** (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100 + `cursor=` → `next_cursor`); **`Idempotency-Key`** on every transaction-creating POST (case-progression, sign-off, PPO-issue, revision, disbursement, account-verification — 24h replay returns the original result); **`X-Correlation-Id`** generated/echoed and written to every P05 audit and log line; `?sort=field:asc|desc`; effective-dated mutations accept `effective_from` (staged via `JOB-PS11-EFFDATE`); timestamps UTC ISO-8601; money as `NUMERIC` strings.

### 8.2 Canonical Error Envelope (platform — overrides v2)

```json
{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "message": "retirement_date is required", "field": "retirement_date", "details": { "reason": "CASE_INPUT_INCOMPLETE" } } }
```

2xx returns the resource payload; 4xx/5xx return the envelope above. The **correlation id is carried in the `X-Correlation-Id` response header, not a body `requestId`** (override of the v2 `{…, requestId}` shape; `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C).

### 8.3 Error-Code Catalog (platform 8-code table + PS11 domain reasons)

PS11 adopts the **platform 8-code table verbatim**; every domain condition is conveyed as a `details.reason` (or a registered `ERR-PS11-*` message id) under one of these HTTP codes. The v2 codes are re-mapped (`VALIDATION_ERROR 400`→`VALIDATION_FAILED 422`; `AUTH_REQUIRED 401`→`UNAUTHENTICATED`; `INTERNAL_ERROR 500`→`INTERNAL`; `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE 503` dropped — upstream failures are handled via **X.3 circuit-breaking + mapping** and surfaced as `PRECONDITION_FAILED 412`/`INTERNAL 500` with `ERR-LOADFAIL`).

| Platform code | HTTP | PS11 use (domain `reason` / `ERR-PS11-*`) |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 422 | `CASE_INPUT_INCOMPLETE`, `ERR-PS11-EMOLUMENTS`, `ERR-PS11-RULE-NOT-EFFECTIVE`, `ERR-PS11-COMMUTATION-LIMIT`, `ERR-PS11-FACTOR-NOT-FOUND`, `ERR-PS11-NOMINEE-SPLIT`, `ERR-PS11-TAX-RULE`, `ERR-PS11-INVALID-ACCOUNT`, `ERR-PS11-ACCOUNT-VERIFY` |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | missing/expired session |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | role/scope/SoD denied (P02); never leaks out-of-scope existence |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | entity absent or out of scope |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | `ERR-PS11-DUP-CASE`, `ERR-PS11-SERVICE-GAP`, `ERR-PS11-VERIFICATION-INCOMPLETE`, `ERR-PS11-DISCREPANCY-OPEN`, `ERR-PS11-SPELL-NOT-ATTESTED`, `ERR-PS11-FP-NOT-NOMINEE`, `ERR-PS11-RECOVERY-PROTECTION`, `ERR-PS11-SCHEME-MISMATCH`, `ERR-PS11-CASE-NOT-SANCTIONED`, `ERR-PS11-DUP-PPO`, `ERR-PS11-CASE-LOCKED-OPTIONS`, `ERR-PS11-REVISION-IMMUTABLE`, `ERR-PS11-LC-SUSPENDED`, `ERR-PS11-PROVISIONAL-PENDING`, `ERR-PS11-PDA-NOT-CERTIFIED`, `ERR-PS11-AUDIT-OBJECTION-OPEN`, `ERR-PS11-DRAWN-AFTER-DEATH`; idempotency replay / duplicate workflow start (`ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`) |
| `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | 412 | upstream (PS03/PS10/PS12/PDA/DigiLocker/registry) unavailable after X.3 retry; a required precondition unmet (`ERR-PRECOND`) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | throttled |
| `INTERNAL` | 500 | unexpected server error (`ERR-LOADFAIL`) |

All `ERR-PS11-*` and `MSG-PS11-*` ids are registered in the **Foundation FS §5 Message Catalogue master index**; all `VAL-PS11-*` ids (`VAL-PS11-CASE`, `VAL-PS11-QUALSVC`, `VAL-PS11-PENSION`, `VAL-PS11-COMMUTE`, `VAL-PS11-FP`, `VAL-PS11-PDA`) in **Foundation FS §2**; all `JOB-PS11-*` ids in **Foundation FS §4** (see §`Alignment` for the job register).

### 8.4 JSON Examples (platform envelope)

**Service-verification sign-off (gate)**

```json
{ "verification_id": "sv-1001", "discrepancy_open_count": 0,
  "spells_attested_count": 2, "spells_total_count": 2, "signoff_complete": true, "status": "LOCKED" }
```

**Account verification failure (penny-drop, platform envelope + X-Correlation-Id header)**

```json
{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "field": "account_name",
  "message": "name mismatch: supplied 'R Kumar' vs bank 'Rajesh Kumar Sharma' (score 0.62)",
  "details": { "reason": "ERR-PS11-ACCOUNT-VERIFY", "score": 0.62 } } }
```

**Authorise PPO (response, with DigiLocker + model)**

```json
{ "ppo_id": "ppo-4512", "ppo_no": "PPO-2026-004512", "ppo_type": "SERVICE_PENSION",
  "basic_pension": "56000.00", "commuted_portion": "22400.00", "residual_pension": "33600.00",
  "effective_from": "2026-10-01", "status": "AUTHORISED_TO_PDA", "pensioner_id": "PNR-000123",
  "pda_disbursement_model": "PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF", "relief_formula_ref": "da-2026-07",
  "digilocker_pushed": true, "digilocker_ref": "dl://issued/PPO-2026-004512" }
```

### 8.5 Integration Points (all external calls over X.3 with P04 credentials)

| System | Direction | Purpose | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| PS01 Employee | in | employee master, DOB, cadre, DOJ, family declarations | internal (platform `employees`) |
| PS03 Attendance/Leave | in | encashable leave balance; non-qualifying leave spells + reason codes | internal |
| PS04 Leave→SR Integration | in | non-qualifying leave events posted in the SR | internal |

| PS10 Payroll | in | last-pay-drawn/emoluments, GPF/NPS contributions, recoveries; verification provenance sign-off | internal |
| PS12 Service Register | in/out | gap-free verification + discrepancy resolution (**in, consumer**); **separation/superannuation/retirement life events posted via `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (**out, PS11 is the SR writer** — §8.7) | internal (PS12 ledger on P05) |
| Platform Documents / DocumentGen (PS13 vault) | in/out | store/sign PPO/sanction/calc-sheet artefacts | internal service contract |
| PS14 Dashboards | out | pension liability, workload, SLA, audit-objection KPIs | internal |

| Income-tax (TDS reference) | reference | tax-parameter reference for FR-09 TDS/89(1) | config / **X.3** if live |

### 8.6 PDA / Treasury Interface Contract (X.3 payload-versioned — R8)

Defines the concrete disbursement interface that FR-14/FR-21 implement on the **X.3 integration framework** (idempotent outbound calls, circuit-breaking, payload versioning, per-integration error mapping; credentials from **P04 `integration_credentials`**). Replaces v2's "pluggable" hand-wave and v2's bespoke transport assumptions.

- **Transport:** FILE_SFTP (signed, encrypted batch files) or REST_API (mTLS), per `interface_type` — both executed by X.3.
- **Disbursement line fields:** `batch_no`, `line_no`, `ppo_no`, `pensioner_no`, `disbursement_type`, `period_month/year`, `amount` (M11_COMPUTES_FULL) **or** `basic_pension` + `relief_formula_ref` (PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF), `account_no` (encrypted), `ifsc`, `account_name`, `verification_ref` (E42), `idempotency_key`.
- **Batch header/trailer:** `pda_code`, `payload_contract_version`, `line_count`, `control_total`, `generated_at`, `signature`.
- **Acknowledgement schema:** per-line `ack_status` ∈ {PAID, FAILED, RETURNED}, `ack_reference`, `failure_code` (error taxonomy), `paid_at`; batch-level `acknowledged_count`, `failed_count`, `control_total_ack`.
- **Bank/treasury error taxonomy (mapped by X.3 per-integration mapping to PS11 exceptions/grievances):** `ACCOUNT_CLOSED`, `ACCOUNT_FROZEN`, `NAME_MISMATCH`, `INVALID_IFSC`, `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `DUPLICATE`, `PENSIONER_DECEASED`, `OTHER`.
- **Retry / re-route:** failed lines retried per the X.3 circuit-breaker policy (max attempts, backoff); persistent failures re-routed to an alternate PDA or raised as grievances; X.3 idempotency prevents double payment.
- **Sandbox tie-out:** every PDA must pass an X.3 sandbox batch (control-total tie-out, ack round-trip, penny-drop) before `sandbox_certified=true` and go-live (FR-21).

### 8.7 SR-Ledger Posting Contract — PS11 as the separation/superannuation SR writer (FR-PS11-SR; D1/D2 remediation)

PS11 has **two distinct roles** against the **PS12 Service Register**, and they are not contradictory:

1. **Consumer (input):** PS11 reads/verifies the ledger for **qualifying-service** computation and runs the completeness/discrepancy gate (FR-PS11-18, FR-PS11-04), drawing non-qualifying spells/leave from **PS04/PS03** and service spans from **PS12** — this consumer role is unchanged.
2. **Writer (output):** PS11 **IS the canonical SR writer** for the **separation / superannuation / retirement life events** (and their benefit consequences). It does not own the ledger engine; it authors only the events below and posts them to the **single canonical write-port**.

**Write-port (canonical, D1):** all postings go to **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** (and reversals to **`POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal`**). A module-local `POST /api/v1/pension/cases/{id}:post-to-sr` is permitted **only as an internal façade that relays to `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest`** — it MUST NOT write the ledger table directly and MUST NOT use `/api/v1/sr/events`.

**Event types emitted by PS11 (cite the exact PS12-published `event_type_code` verbatim):**

| `event_type_code` | Emitted when | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SEPARATION` | any separation case reaches closure | generic separation life event |
| `SUPERANNUATION` | age/superannuation retirement | qualifying-service-bearing |
| `RETIREMENT` | retirement-on-completion / invalidation retirement | qualifying-service-bearing |
| `VOLUNTARY_RETIREMENT` | VRS accepted | qualifying-service-bearing (incl. weightage) |
| `RESIGNATION` | resignation accepted | service forfeiture per rule |
| `DEATH_IN_SERVICE` | death-in-service separation/benefit consequence | **PS11 posts the death-in-service separation consequence; it does NOT post the `DECEASED` master flag — that is PS01's identity event.** |
| `FAMILY_PENSION_SANCTIONED` | family pension sanctioned (death-in-service or conversion) | benefit-consequence event |

**Ingest payload contract (D1):**
- **Dedup tuple (mandatory on every ingest call):** `(source_module, source_reference_id, source_event_version)`, with explicit **`source_module="PS11"`** (NOT inferred), validated against the event type's `allowed_source_modules`. `source_reference_id` is the PS11 case / sanction id (no legacy `source_event_id`); `source_event_version` increments on supersession.
- **`fact_key` (mandatory for qualifying-service-bearing events):** `SEPARATION`, `SUPERANNUATION`, `RETIREMENT`, `VOLUNTARY_RETIREMENT` MUST derive and send `fact_key` per the event type's `fact_correlation_rule` (PS12 FR-01); missing → `SR_FACT_KEY_REQUIRED`.
- **Scoping:** explicit required **`tenant_id`** and **`entity_id`** on the payload (PS12 hashes `tenant_id`+`employee_id` into `entry_hash`).
- **Idempotency:** the HTTP `Idempotency-Key` header may be a writer-local hash, but the **persisted dedup tuple above is the contract**.
- **Reversal/correction:** never delete/edit (supersede-only); use the PS12 **`is_reversal=true`** + `reverses_source_reference_id` envelope via `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest/reversal` with the published partner type. PS12 auto-spawns the corrigendum.

**Where it runs:** FR-PS11-02 (separation case closure), FR-PS11-08 (family-pension sanction) and FR-PS11-11 (PPO issue) relay their SR postings through this contract; the append is part of the same all-or-nothing transaction as the closure/sanction commit, with **P05** capturing the mutation.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements (platform baseline + PS11 specifics)

The platform NFR baseline (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §8.2) **overrides the invented v2 NFR** (99.9%→99.5%, RPO 15min→1h).

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Performance (interactive) | Platform p95 < 500 ms @ 300 concurrent; reads/config per platform read-heavy targets (p95 < 300 ms cached / < 1000 ms uncached); benefit estimator < 1.5s; account verification (penny-drop, X.3) < 3s; writes p95 < 1500 ms |
| Performance (batch, X.1) | **M11_COMPUTES_FULL:** DA revision (`JOB-PS11-PENSION-RUN`) for 100,000 pensioners within 30 min; monthly disbursement batch (`JOB-PS11-DISBURSE`) < 10 min. **PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF:** relief-order issue + reconciliation < 5 min |
| Determinism | Identical results given the snapshotted rule version (E30–E36 FK) and signed-off verified inputs; external/indicative NPS-CRA/UPS-annuity figures excluded; concurrent-event order per §16.9 (tested invariant) |
| Input provenance | No benefit engine runs without a SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED service-verification record (FR-18, IR2a) |
| Continuity (critical) | First pension/anticipatory/provisional authorised before pension commencement for 100% of cases |
| Availability | **99.5%/month** (platform baseline); batch windows off-peak (X.1) |
| Scalability | Horizontal scaling of revision/disbursement workers; partition pensioner population by PDA/org/model; per-tenant job isolation (X.1) |
| Integrity | ACID per case sanction, PPO issue, conversion, revision-apply, death-conversion; immutable sanctioned snapshots & applied revisions enforced by **P05 DB-trigger**; pre-credit verification before first credit |
| Security | OIDC/SSO + **MFA for high-privilege statutory roles**; **RBAC v1.7 + five-dimension row-level scope enforced by P02**; SoD (incl. rule-table maker≠approver) by P01/P02; field-level encryption for bank/PAN/Aadhaar/PRAN/nominee/family/benefit amounts; **masked on serialization by P02** with audited reveal |
| Privacy | DPDP Act 2023; PII minimisation; heightened sensitivity for deceased/family data; death-registry/DBT data purpose-limited; **statutory retention never below the platform 7-yr floor** (P05) |
| Auditability | Every state change captured by **P05 DB-trigger** (`audit_log`), immutable, 7-yr; `calc_trace` retained; audit objections tracked to closure (FR-23); reading an audit log is itself audited |
| Recoverability | **RTO < 4 h, RPO < 1 h** (platform baseline); staged compute allows safe restart of revisions/disbursements; X.1 catch-up policy |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA; plain-language, compassionate flows; 3-state citizen tracker; large-text/elderly-friendly self-service |
| Observability | Per platform §0.5: structured logs (correlation id), metrics, traces; first-pension-on-time SLA, LC-overdue alerts, disbursement-ack monitoring, revision exceptions, drawn-after-death exceptions, audit-objection ageing; job-run audit rows (X.1); notification-delivery metrics (X.2) |
| Compliance | Statutory pension/commutation/gratuity/family-pension/UPS/NPS-default/tax rules; effective-dated rule-table versioning on the config cascade (FR-19); audit-objection traceability (FR-23) |
| Tamper-evidence | Tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** (audit hash-chaining to WORM) rather than inventing a parallel mechanism (Platform §P05/§Z) |

## 13. Migration & Launch (on P06)

Legacy pensioner/pension data migrates through the **P06 ETL+V framework** (Extract → Validate → Transform → Load → Verify; scripted idempotently; **three mandatory staging dry runs gate cutover**; waves; `migration_runs` ledger; failed records logged with source row + violated rule). Every migrated PS11 table carries a **`ps11_source_id` traceability + dedup column** (the `GAP (enterprise-specific)` analogue of `darwinbox_source_id` — the legacy source is the enterprise pension register, not Darwinbox).

### 13.1 Data Migration

- Migrate the existing pensioner population: pensioner master, current pension, PPO numbers, **PDA bindings + disbursement model**, bank details (encrypted), **Aadhaar/PRAN**, LC status, and commutation/restoration schedules (capturing reduction dates; flag `migrated_date_unknown` where unavailable).
- Migrate in-flight separation cases at their current stage with verified service and computed benefits where available; build service-verification records (FR-18) for in-flight cases.
- Map legacy separation types and schemes (OPS/NPS/UPS); **load and sign off the effective-dated rule-table entities (E30–E36)** through the config cascade — the genuine critical path.
- Load the **family-members register (E26)** (Form 3/14) distinct from nominee registers (E21); load **prior-service records (E39)**.

### 13.2 Validation & Parallel Run

- Recompute a statistically significant sample of legacy pensions/gratuities (incl. service-gratuity, UPS, NPS-default, path-specific family pension, tax) and reconcile within tolerance.
- Run a parallel DA revision against legacy output and tie out per-pensioner deltas per disbursement model.
- Validate PPO-number uniqueness and PDA bindings; **dry-run a disbursement batch in an X.3 sandbox PDA channel with the §8.6 contract and penny-drop tie-out** (FR-21).
- Tie out the gratuity-ceiling auto-step against the current DA level.

### 13.3 Cutover & Launch

- Freeze legacy writes; final delta migration (P06 cutover freeze); switch disbursement instructions to PS11; verify the first post-cutover monthly disbursement end-to-end with PDA acknowledgement per model.
- Enable pensioner self-service (3-state tracker, outcome estimator, e-PPO/DigiLocker, LC calendar, bereavement guide) after data validation.
- Benchmark the pre-retirement workflow against **DoPPW *Bhavishya***; enable **DigiLocker** delivery over X.3 (FR-24).

### 13.4 Launch Readiness Checklist

|---|---|
| Rule-table entities (E30–E36) loaded, approved & signed off (config cascade) | required (critical path) |

| `JOB-PS11-FORECAST` | Refresh due-for-retirement projections & threshold alerts | nightly | idempotent per-period key; backoff ×3; `JOB-FAIL`→`MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL` |
| `JOB-PS11-EFFDATE` | Apply effective-dated rule-table rows due today (config cascade) | daily | period-aware; staged-not-live |
| `JOB-PS11-PENSION-RUN` | DA/pay-commission revision batch (model-segmented) | on-event / scheduled | period lock; per-tenant isolation; run audit row |

| `JOB-PS11-SIGNOFF-REMIND` | Remind pending FR-18 three-point sign-off tasks | daily | idempotent |

### C. RBAC v1.7 Role Additions (registered in RBAC §4.3/§2.2; SoD by P01/P02)

| Enterprise actor | Expressed as (RBAC v1.7) | SoD / scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Pension / Dealing Officer** | new entity-scoped module-admin role (analogous to Payroll Admin, RBAC §2.2) + capability flag | maker; entity + org-unit scope; MFA |
| **Pension Sanctioning Authority / Head of Office** | new role (P01 approver) | checker; cannot self-approve (multi-role INTERSECTION); MFA |
| **SR Custodian / Registrar (PS12)** | new entity-scoped role + capability flag on the PS12 ledger | certifies SR; case-scoped |
| **PDA / Treasury / Bank CPPC** | new role + capability flag; integration identity over X.3 | disbursement ack; no calc authority |
| **Disciplinary Authority (PS09)** | existing PS09 new role (referenced) | supplies proceedings decision (FR-22) |
| **Auditor / AG** | **map to Org-Admin read + time-bound entitlement + P05 query access** | read-all; raises objections; **no parallel write role** |
| **System Administrator** | **map to Org Admin / Platform Super Admin** | rule-table maintain; no transactional self-approval |

All new roles/flags are **ADDITIONS** to the RBAC v1.7 taxonomy (never a parallel scheme); PII Protection Ceiling and field masking apply unchanged; capability flags are Org-Admin-granted and P05-audited.

### D. Net-New (`GAP enterprise-specific`) Engines Authored by PS11

Per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §D, PS11 authors the statutory business logic PrimeSoft lacks — **`qualifying_service_ledger`, `pension_calculation`, `commutation`, `terminal_benefits`, `pension_sanction`** (and the FR-18 completeness gate, FR-19 rule tables, FR-20 death detection, FR-21 PDA model, FR-22 Rule-9 provisional pension) — each **running on P01 (workflow), P05 (audit), P06 (migration)** and consuming PS01 + the PS12 SR ledger. No platform engine is re-implemented.

## Amendments (v3 → v3.1: cross-module remediation)

Resolves the cross-module integration findings (R1–R5) per `docs/review/REMEDIATION.md` (D1/D2; R1 finding **F-05**). The PS12 SR ingestion contract is frozen by PS12; PS11 conforms as an SR **writer**.

| # | Finding / decision | v3.0 (contradictory / implicit) | v3.1 (remediated) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **F-05 — PS11 write-vs-consume role contradictory.** Reviews had PS11 listed both as an SR writer and as "consumes only"; nobody authoritatively owned the separation/superannuation event. **DECISION: PS11 IS the SR writer** for those life events. | §1.4 / §3.3 / §8.5 said only "reads/verifies and **appends** retirement events"; §`Amendments v2→v3` row 11 listed SR writers as PS04/PS05/PS06/PS09 (PS11 excluded) | Writer role made **explicit and non-contradictory** in the out-of-scope para (§1.4), the boundary table (§3.3), the integration table (§8.5) and amendment row 11; PS11 **consumes** the ledger for qualifying service **and** posts separation events | REMEDIATION D1/D2; R1 F-05 |
| A2 | **Explicit SR-posting section** authored citing the exact PS12-published `event_type_code`s for PS11. | implicit "append SR event on closure" only | New **§8.7 SR-Ledger Posting Contract**, codes verbatim: `SEPARATION`, `SUPERANNUATION`, `RETIREMENT`, `VOLUNTARY_RETIREMENT`, `RESIGNATION`, `DEATH_IN_SERVICE`, `FAMILY_PENSION_SANCTIONED` | REMEDIATION D2 |

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Benefit Computation Order (default sequence)

1. **Build & sign off service verification (FR-18, P01 PARALLEL_ALL_OF)** → 2. Verify gap-free service (PS12) → 3. Compute qualifying service (deduct non-qualifying spells from PS03/PS04, add counted prior service, round half-years per E36) → 4. Resolve emoluments base (PS10) → 5. **Route by benefit outcome:** ≥10 yrs → basic pension (OPS flat-50% / UPS assured / NPS-default); <10 yrs → service gratuity; NPS superannuation → indicative → 6. Commutation (option, factor, value, residual, reduction-date restoration schedule on `JOB-PS11-RESTORE`) → 7. Gratuity (retirement/death/service, slab, ceiling with DA auto-step) → 8. Family pension (path-specific window, E26-driven) → 9. Leave encashment (PS03) → 10. GPF final (PS10) → 11. Tax/TDS/89(1) → 12. Net recoveries within protection → 13. Sanction (P01; provisional if proceedings) → 14. PPO issue (DocumentGen + DigiLocker over X.3) → 15. Pre-credit account verification (E42 over X.3) → 16. Disbursement (X.3) & pensioner enrolment. Every mutation captured by P05.

### 16.2 Rounding & Money Rules

- All amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)`; factors/rates `NUMERIC(9,4)`; service in integer Y/M/D; no floating point.
- Benefit/half-year rounding per `pen_rounding_rules` (E36), referenced via `rule_version_ref` (FK).

### 16.3 Recovery Priority & Net Protection

Statutory dues → court attachment → disciplinary recovery (PS09) → enterprise over-payment (incl. post-death overpayment E38) → outstanding loans/advances (PS10) → other. Breaching the protected floor defers lower-priority recoveries (`CONFLICT` / `ERR-PS11-RECOVERY-PROTECTION`); spillover recovered from future pension/estate where rules allow.

### 16.4 Immutability & Correction Policy

A SANCTIONED calculation, an ISSUED/ACTIVE PPO, and an APPLIED revision are immutable — **enforced by the P05 DB-trigger (no UPDATE/DELETE on `audit_log`; mutations on business tables produce a new immutable audit row)**. Corrections are issued as a SUPERSEDING calculation/REVISED PPO, a new revision batch, or a recovery/arrear — never a silent edit. Anticipatory/provisional PPOs are superseded by the final PPO with adjustment. Rule-table rows are SUPERSEDED, never deleted once referenced (IR17). Audit-objection corrections flow only through the revision workflow (FR-23).

### 16.5 Pension Eligibility & Service Gratuity (R2)

- **≥10 years qualifying service:** flat **50%** of emoluments base (no proportionate reduction). The pre-2006 proportionate fraction is deprecated.
- **<10 years qualifying service:** **no monthly pension** — a one-time **service gratuity** (`gratuity_type=SERVICE_GRATUITY`), a multiplier of emoluments per completed half-year, with **no DCRG ceiling**.
- Branch determined by `meets_min_pension_service` against `pen_pension_limit_rules` (E35).

### 16.6 OPS vs NPS vs UPS Handling (R3)

- Scheme derived from DOJ vs cutover + UPS opt-in; override P05-audited.
- **OPS:** PS11 computes defined-benefit pension, commutation, gratuity, family pension, GPF.
- **NPS — superannuation:** record corpus/PRAN (CRA over X.3); indicative annuity/withdrawal (non-binding, excluded from determinism); no GPF.
- **NPS — death-in-service/invalidation:** compute the CCS-NPS Rules 2021 default benefit = OPS-equivalent family/invalid pension.
- **UPS (opted-in):** assured payout ≈ 50% of last-12-month average pay with the E35 minimum guarantee; opt-in recorded and irreversible per rule.

### 16.7 Enhanced Family Pension Windows (R1)

| Path (`enhanced_basis`) | Enhanced rate window | Step-down |
|---|---|---|
| IN_SERVICE (death-in-service) | **10 years, no age cap** (post-2013 CCS amendment) | to normal after 10 yrs |
| AFTER_RETIREMENT (death after retirement) | **7 years OR up to age 67 / would-be-superannuation, whichever earlier** | to normal at window end |

Both windows are computed from `pen_family_pension_rates` (E32) and recorded in `enhanced_window_rule`; both step-downs are tested invariants.

### 16.8 Tax / TDS on Terminal Benefits (R12)

| Component | Exemption treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gratuity (DCRG) | Exempt up to the ₹20,00,000 cap; excess taxable | `gratuity_exempt_amount` / `gratuity_taxable_amount` |
| Commuted pension | Exempt per rule (enterprise employees fully exempt) | `commutation_exempt_amount` |
| Leave encashment | Exempt per the applicable cap | `leave_encashment_exempt_amount` |
| Arrears (revision/89(1)) | Section 89(1) relief computed | `section_89_relief` |
| TDS | Deducted on the net taxable total | `tds_amount`; `net_settlement = gross − recoveries − TDS` |

### 16.9 Deterministic Revision-Application Order (R13)

When multiple events share an effective date for one pensioner, apply strictly in this order; record the applied order in `calc_trace`:

1. **Pay-commission re-fixation** (re-fixes the basic).
2. **Commuted-portion restoration** (changes the base on which relief is computed).
3. **DA / Dearness Relief** (applied on the re-fixed/restored basic).
4. **Age-based additional pension** (80/85/90/95/100-year increments).

This ordering is part of the determinism contract (IR18) and a tested invariant.

### 16.10 Assumptions Log

- One PrimeSoft tenant per deployment; entity-aware (`tenant_id`/`entity_id`) for departments/directorates.
- All benefit parameters are **first-class effective-dated rule-table rows (E30–E36)** on the **config cascade**, maintained by SysAdmin and approved by a distinct approver (SoD via P01/P02); `rule_version_ref` is a FK.
- **Disbursement model is explicit per PDA** (E37); FR-13/FR-14 branch on it; batch sizing differs by model; both run over X.3.
- PDA/treasury/bank conforms to the **§8.6 X.3 payload-versioned contract**; sandbox certification precedes go-live; credentials from P04.
- Jeevan Pramaan/DLC and DigiLocker/UIDAI/CRA integrations available over X.3 with fallbacks.
- Death-registry/Aadhaar-DBT signals available for FR-20 reconciliation (advisory until confirmed).
- Determinism holds **given the snapshotted rule version and signed-off verified inputs**; external NPS/UPS-annuity figures excluded.
- All platform engines (P01–P06, X.1–X.3, W.1–W.3) are live and consumed by id; PS11 authors no platform plumbing.
