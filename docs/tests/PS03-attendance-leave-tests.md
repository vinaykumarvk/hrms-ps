# PS03 — Attendance and Leave Management — Acceptance & E2E Test Suite

## 1. Header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | **PS03 — Attendance and Leave Management** (alias PS-M03; EXTEND/REUSE of PrimeSoft M04 Leave + M05 Attendance) |
| Scope | FR-01…FR-23 acceptance criteria, business rules, edge cases, state tables, and the platform API/error/state/auth contracts. Covers shifts/rosters, holidays/RH, punch ingest, daily attendance + sub-day allocation, regularisation, overtime, WFH/OD, comp-off, leave configuration, accrual + ledger + optimistic-lock concurrency, leave apply/approve/cancel, backdate, year-close, encashment, payroll (LWP) feed, self-service/notifications, delegation, anomaly review, DPDP consent, sanction entitlements, forecast/mass-leave/blackout/RTW, and the PS03→PS04 SR-lineage handoff. |
| Grounding | `docs/brd/v3/PS03-attendance-and-leave-management.md` (FRs §6, integrity rules §5.6, worked example §5.8, state tables §10, error mapping §8.4, VAL-PS03 §8.6, jobs §8.7); `docs/contracts/openapi/PS03.yaml`; `docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.yaml` (ERR-PS03-* + bare domain reasons → 8 platform HTTP codes); `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml` (PS03 leave_application, regularisation, overtime, punch_anomaly_review, consent_record, year_close_run); `docs/contracts/auth-matrix.yaml` (PS03 actions/roles). |
| Traceability | Each test case declares `Traces-to` (FR + AC, integrity rule, state transition, or contract clause). Full FR→TC matrix in §3; 0 gaps. |

### 1.1 Test environment & data assumptions

- **Base/API:** all routes under `/api/v1/atl/*`; Bearer JWT carrying resolved roles + `tenant_id`/`entity_id` scope (P02 `Authorization.check`); `Idempotency-Key` on every workflow-initiating POST (24h replay → original result); cursor pagination (`limit` default 25 / max 100, `cursor`→`next_cursor`); `X-Correlation-Id` echoed on every response and never carried as a body field.
- **Error contract:** 2xx returns the resource payload; every 4xx/5xx returns `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field", "details": {} } }` and nothing else. Negative assertions specify the exact wire status + `error.code`/`details.reason` per the taxonomy.
- **Multi-tenancy:** two tenants seeded — **T1** (entity **E1**) and **T2** (entity **E2**). Every PS03 table row carries `tenant_id`/`entity_id`; unscoped or cross-tenant reads must be rejected (404), not defaulted.
- **Personas (T1/E1 unless stated):** `EMP-1001` (employee, self-service); `EMP-1002`, `EMP-1003` (employees / peers for concurrency); `MGR-2001` (L1 reporting manager of EMP-1001/1002); `MGR-2002` (delegate manager); `LADM` (leave_admin); `AADM` (attendance_admin); `HRADM` (hr_admin); `SANCT` (sanctioning_authority); `PAYO` (payroll_admin); `AUD` (auditor / Org-Admin read); `DPO` (dpo, `dpo_governance` flag); `REV` (anomaly reviewer, `anomaly_reviewer` flag). `EMP-T2` is an employee in T2/E2.
- **Leave catalog seeded (per §5.7):** `EL` (accruable, debit_ratio 1.0, year_basis CALENDAR, CF cap 300, is_encashable, is_encashable_on_retirement); `HPL` (half-pay, debit_ratio 1.0, no-lapse, retirement make-up); `COMMUTED` (debit_ratio 2.0, `debits_against_leave_type_id`=HPL); `CL` (accruable, lapse-fully, sandwich EXCLUDE); `MAT` (sanction, EVENT quota 180, gender FEMALE, ≤2 surviving children); `CCL` (sanction, CAREER quota 730, FEMALE); `PAT` (gender MALE, 15); `STUDY`/`SAB`/`LWP` (special/sanction); `COMPOFF` (redemption vehicle only — no `leave_balances` row).
- **Policies/config seeded:** accrual policies (EL monthly 2.5, HPL, CL) with `rounding_mode=NEAREST_HALF_CARRY`, `proration_method=DAYS_IN_SERVICE_OVER_CYCLE`, `suspend_accrual_on_lwp=true`; `module_config` — `REGULARISATION_WINDOW_DAYS=15`, `REGULARISATION_LIMIT=3/mo`, `BACKDATE_WINDOW_DAYS=30`, `COMPOFF_VALIDITY_DAYS=90`, `RH_CAP=2`, `RESERVATION_TTL_MIN=1440`, `CLOCK_SKEW_MIN=5`, `CONFLICT_THRESHOLD_PCT=40`, a `BLACKOUT_PERIOD` window on 2026-03-25..2026-03-31 for EL/CL.
- **Balances (2026, EMP-1001):** EL current 130.0 / reserved 0 / available 130.0 / version 7; HPL current 8.0; CCL entitlement CAREER 730 consumed 120 (remaining 610).
- **Devices/consent:** biometric device `DEV-BIO-1` (P04-registered, `EMPLOYEE_BOUND`, geofence set); RFID `DEV-RF-1`; EMP-1001 `biometric_consents` STATUTORY_DUTY GRANTED, fallback RFID.
- **Downstream doubles:** PS04 SR consumer, PS10 payroll, PS11 pension, PS13 documents, P01 workflow, P02 authz, P05 audit, X.2 notifications are available as verifiable test doubles/stubs; the PS04 event bus is asserted for the SR-lineage E2E, and a network spy asserts `POST /api/v1/sr/ingest` is **never** called by PS03.

- Expected: `202` queued; on completion EL `ACCRUAL +2.5`, `balance_after=130.5`; `leave_balances.current_balance=130.5`; X.2 accrual-credited notice.

**TC-PS03-061 — Proration + rounding (boundary math)** · Priority: P1
- Preconditions: EMP-1004 joins mid-cycle (15 of 30 days served); monthly accrual 2.5; `proration_method=DAYS_IN_SERVICE_OVER_CYCLE`; `rounding_mode=NEAREST_HALF_CARRY`.
- Steps: run accrual for the join month.
- Expected: raw = 2.5 × 15/30 = 1.25 → rounded to nearest-half = 1.5 with the +0.25 carried remainder retained (never dropped); ledger shows credited 1.5 and carried remainder tracked; App. C consistency.

**TC-PS03-062 — One ledger entry per mutation** · Priority: P1
- Steps: perform accrual, an avail (via approved leave), a manual adjustment.
- Expected: each action writes exactly one `leave_balance_ledger` row with a correct `balance_after`; no balance change exists without a ledger entry (§5.6 r1/r3).

**TC-PS03-063 — Ledger conservation** · Priority: P1
- Steps: for EMP-1001 EL 2026, read latest ledger `balance_after` and `leave_balances.current_balance`; run `JOB-PS03-LEDGER-RECON`.

- Expected: maker `201` pending; checker approval applies the ADJUSTMENT ledger entry; maker == checker blocked (403 SoD); missing reason → `422 ERR-REASON-REQ`.

**TC-PS03-065 — Optimistic-lock concurrency (two concurrent debits)** · Priority: P1
- Preconditions: EMP-1001 EL `version=7`, available small enough that both cannot both proceed against the raw row; two APPROVED-decision requests target the same balance concurrently, each `expectedVersion:7`.
- Steps: fire both `POST /atl/leave-applications/{id}/decision {decision:"APPROVE", expectedVersion:7}` in parallel.
- Expected: exactly one succeeds `200` (balance debited, `version→8`); the other → `409 CONFLICT`, `error.code=OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`; no lost update; balance debit acquired `FOR UPDATE` + version assertion (R1/R12).

**TC-PS03-066 — Balance never negative** · Priority: P1
- Preconditions: EL available 1.0, `advance_allowed=false`.
- Steps: approve a 2.0-day EL debit.

**TC-PS03-075 — Approve single transaction** · Priority: P1
- Preconditions: EMP-1001 EL application SUBMITTED, `version=7`.
- Steps: `SANCT`/HR approves `{decision:"APPROVE", expectedVersion:7}`.
- Expected: `200 APPROVED`; single txn: reservation `CONSUMED` → ledger `AVAIL −0.5 (balance_after 129.5)` → `current_balance=129.5`, `reserved=0`, `version=8` → recompute enqueued → PS04 SR enqueue (`sr_posting_status=PENDING`) → X.2 notify; P01 emits exactly one `workflow_actions` row (idempotent on retry).

- Expected: `409 CONFLICT`, `error.code=PERIOD_ALREADY_LOCKED`.

**TC-PS03-108 — Late correction → adjustment** · Priority: P1
- Preconditions: 2026-06 locked; a late-approved regularisation reduces an ABSENT to PRESENT.
- Steps: process the correction.
- Expected: `GET /atl/payroll-feed/adjustments?payPeriod=2026-07` shows a `PRESENT_DELTA`/`LWP_DELTA` row applied in the next open period; locked June feed unchanged (R6).

**TC-PS03-109 — Feed reconciliation** · Priority: P2

- Expected: pending + new leave `workflow_actions` route to MGR-2002 (P01 `delegate`); delegated items badged.

**TC-PS03-115 — SLA auto-route** · Priority: P3
- Preconditions: `auto_on_sla_breach=true`, no active window; approval breaches SLA.
- Expected: P01 auto-routes to the delegate/escalation even absent an explicit window.

- Expected: all three PS04 events (`LEAVE_APPROVED`/`LEAVE_AMENDED`/`LEAVE_CANCELLED`) carry the **same** `leave_spell_lineage_id` with increasing `event_sequence`; PS04 dedupes by `lineage_id + event_sequence` (B3).

**TC-PS03-139 — Error envelope contract** · Priority: P1
- Steps: trigger any 4xx (e.g. TC-PS03-073); inspect body + headers.
- Expected: body is exactly `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field", "details" } }`; no body `requestId`; correlation id only in `X-Correlation-Id` response header and written to the P05 audit line.

**TC-PS03-140 — Pagination bounds** · Priority: P2
- Steps: `GET /atl/leave-applications?limit=500`; `GET .../?limit=` (default); paginate with `cursor`/`next_cursor`.
- Expected: `limit` clamped to max 100; default 25; response carries `next_cursor`; stable cursor traversal, no duplicates/omissions.

**TC-PS03-141 — Unauthenticated** · Priority: P1
- Steps: any `/atl/*` call with absent/expired Bearer token.
- Expected: `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`.

**TC-PS03-142 — Cross-tenant isolation** · Priority: P1
- Steps: EMP-1001 (T1) requests EMP-T2 (T2) balances/applications by id; and an unscoped query.
- Expected: `404 NOT_FOUND` (out-of-scope indistinguishable from absent, no existence leak); unscoped query rejected, not defaulted (Platform §0.1).

**TC-PS03-143 — Ledger conservation invariant** · Priority: P1
- Steps: run a mixed sequence — accrual, apply+approve, cancel (reversal), adjustment, year-close — for EMP-1001 EL; sum signed ledger `amount` from OPENING.
- Expected: running `balance_after` is monotonically consistent; final sum equals `leave_balances.current_balance`; every balance change has exactly one ledger row; append-only (no UPDATE/DELETE) holds throughout (§5.6 r1/r3).

### By priority

| Priority | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| P1 (critical) | 64 | Money/ledger/concurrency/statutory/SoD/E2E paths — must pass to ship (+6 v3.2: 148, 149, 150, 152, 153, 155) |
| P2 (high) | 70 | Core functional + integrity + authorization (+7 v3.2: 144, 146, 147, 151, 154, 156, 157) |
| P3 (medium) | 23 | Secondary flows, UI-adjacent, caps/edge advisories (+1 v3.2: 145) |

### FR coverage

**23 of 23 functional requirements covered (FR-01…FR-23) — 0 gaps.** All platform contract concerns (error envelope, pagination, idempotency, correlation id, multi-tenant scope safety), all PS03 state machines (leave_application, regularisation, overtime, punch_anomaly_review, consent_record, year_close_run), the ERR-PS03-* / bare-reason error mappings, and the PS03→PS04 SR-lineage handoff (with the negative assertion that PS03 never calls `/sr/ingest`) are exercised.

**v3.2 field-reconciliation delta covered (TC-PS03-144..157).** The nine new entities (E32–E40: `attendance_policies`, `overtime_policies`, `attendance_networks`, `geofences`, `leave_reasons`, `attendance_reasons`, `leave_balance_adjustments`, `leave_revocations`, `attendance_lock_periods`) and the promoted DATA columns (leave hourly/max, shift wfh/type, holiday category/recurrence, OT reason/holiday, leave application approver_note/hourly_minutes, device modality) are exercised via config-master CRUD, the balance-adjustment and leave-revocation P01 flows, the monthly attendance lock with locked-period edit blocking, geofence + IP-network punch governance, and hourly-leave application — each with happy path and key negative asserting exact reused error codes.
