## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Dashboard and Analytics module (**M14-DAS**) is the **cross-module intelligence layer** of the HRMS. It reads from every transactional module (M01–M13), transforms raw operational data into governed, version-controlled metrics, and presents them through **role-based dashboards**, **workforce and operational analytics**, **compliance & statutory dashboards**, and a **self-service report builder**. M14 is the single place where a leader, an HR officer, a department head, an auditor, or an employee sees "the numbers" — and every number is **defined once, computed consistently, permission-scoped, temporally honest, fairness-audited, rectifiable, and traceable back to the source record**.

M14 owns **no transactional master data**. It defines and owns only its **analytics artefacts**: dashboards, widgets, KPI definitions (with effective-dated targets), saved views, saved reports, report schedules, alert rules, embed tokens, source data contracts, an establishment/position reference, predictive models with model cards, and an **analytics data layer** (semantic model, data marts, materialised views, bitemporal snapshot store, and an ETL/refresh pipeline). It enforces **row-level security that mirrors the operational RBAC and org-unit scoping** *and* **metric-level privacy** (complementary small-cell suppression) so that the same dashboard shows a manager only their span, an HR officer only their delegated org units, and an executive the whole enterprise — without leaking a single record beyond permission **and without re-identifying individuals through aggregate arithmetic**.

### 1.2 Business Context and Problem Statement

Public-sector HR leadership today reconstructs the workforce picture from spreadsheets exported out of disconnected systems: headcount that disagrees between payroll and the establishment register, reservation-roster compliance computed by hand, retirement bulges discovered too late to plan succession, SLA breaches invisible until an audit, and "the same KPI" calculated three different ways by three departments. The cost is poor decisions, audit findings, statutory non-compliance (reservation rosters, mandatory training, SR verification), and an inability to answer basic questions — "how many Group-A posts are vacant in District X?" — without a week of manual effort. M14 eliminates this by providing **one governed metric layer, one set of role-scoped dashboards, and self-service analytics** with full lineage, freshness transparency, **bitemporal reproducibility (the "June report" reads the same in September)**, and drill-through to the authoritative record — and crucially provides a **reconciliation explainer** that answers "why does this number differ from what Payroll told me?" directly on screen.

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives

| # | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | One governed definition per metric | 100% of dashboard tiles resolve to a registered `kpi_definition`; zero ad-hoc inline formulae in production |
| G2 | Permission-scoped truth | Every query is RLS-filtered; an automated test proves no role sees a record outside its scope |
| G3 | Consistency with sources | KPI recomputation against source modules reconciles **at the same watermark** within per-KPI tolerance; reconciliation report shows 0 unexplained variance |
| G4 | Freshness transparency | Every dashboard and report shows an explicit `data_as_of` timestamp and staleness state in **role-adaptive language**; no silent stale data |
| G5 | Self-service | HR/department users build, save, schedule, and export reports without IT tickets |
| G6 | Statutory compliance visibility | Reservation roster, mandatory training, SR verification, and SLA dashboards available to authorised roles with audit-grade exports, pinned to a **named establishment/position source of record** |
| G7 | Forward-looking insight, fairly governed | Retirement forecasting (deterministic) ships early; attrition/succession is advisory, **fairness-audited, friction-gated, and prohibited as a sole administrative basis** |
| G8 | Performance at scale | P95 dashboard load < 2.5s on pre-aggregated marts for an enterprise of 100k+ employees, with **async audit-on-read** sustaining 500 concurrent users |
| G9 | Temporal honesty | Every snapshot is bitemporal (valid-time + knowledge-time); an "as-of-knowledge" report reproduces exactly what was shown historically |
| PS10 | Rectifiability | A DPDP correction/erasure in M01 propagates to marts, snapshots, predictions, and export artefacts within SLA, reconciled against statutory retention |

### 1.4 Scope Summary

In scope: role-based dashboard framework with KPI tiles/charts/drill-down; configurable, versioned, **effective-dated** KPI definition & calculation engine; the analytics data layer (semantic model, data marts, materialised views, **bitemporal snapshots**, ETL refresh, freshness tracking); row-level security mirroring RBAC **plus metric-level complementary suppression**; **maker-checker on RLS policy and embed-token changes**; workforce analytics; per-module operational analytics; compliance & statutory dashboards pinned to a named **establishment/position reference**; self-service report builder; scheduled report distribution & multi-format export (PDF/Excel/CSV); drill-through to source records (permission-gated); alerting/thresholds/KPI targets (effective-dated); data-freshness indicators & stale-data behaviour with **role-adaptive language**; **deterministic retirement forecasting**; **probabilistic attrition/succession with a fairness gate and friction-gated individual scores**; benchmarking; natural-language query (confidence-gated, provenance-logged, named LLM) & embedded BI (hardened transport, revocation); mobile/executive dashboards (with offline RESTRICTED-data policy); **DPDP rectification/erasure propagation**; **source data contracts**; and **access-anomaly detection**.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): all transactional capture and writes (M01–M13 own their data; M14 reads only); the operational RBAC catalog and authentication (platform); document storage internals (M13 — M14 references generated export objects); the statutory SR ledger writes (M12). M14 **never mutates source records**; drill-through opens the owning module's record view, it does not edit it. The **adjudication** of reservation roster decisions and the **authoring** of sanctioned-strength values remain establishment/administration functions; M14 hosts the establishment reference and reports compliance but does not approve posts.

### 1.5 Key Stakeholders

Employee (self-service), Reporting Manager, HR Officer/Admin, Department Head / Appointing Authority, Executive / Leadership (Secretary, HoD, CEO-equivalent), Auditor (read-only + anomaly review), Analytics Administrator (KPI/dashboard steward), Data Engineer (ETL/mart operator), Establishment Officer (position/sanctioned-strength custodian — **new**), Data Protection Officer (DPO — rectification/erasure governance — **new**), System Administrator.

### 1.6 Success Criteria

M14 is "successful" when: every published dashboard tile maps to a governed KPI; all queries are RLS-enforced and pass scope-leak **and aggregate re-identification** tests; freshness is visible on every surface in role-appropriate words; snapshots are bitemporal and an audit "as-of-knowledge" reproduces history exactly; HR and department users self-serve reports and schedules; statutory dashboards are live, exportable, and pinned to a named establishment source; predictive views carry model cards, fairness assessments, and prohibited-use clauses with friction-gated individual access; NL query refuses below confidence and logs its interpretation; embed tokens are revocable and never travel in URLs; DPDP corrections/erasures propagate across the analytics estate; and the metric layer reconciles to the sources at watermark within published tolerance — all with a complete, **asynchronous, anomaly-monitored** audit trail of who viewed/exported what.

Maker-checker applies to **publishing** KPI definitions, enterprise/statutory dashboards, **RLS scope policies, embed-token issuance, and predictive-model activation**.

### 2.3 In-Scope / Out-of-Scope Boundary Table

| Concern | In M14? | Owner / Note |
|---|---|---|
| Employee master data | Read only (via mart) | M01 golden source |
| Leave / attendance facts | Read only | M03 (M14 aggregates) |
| SR events & verification status | Read only | M12 owns ledger; M14 reports status |
| Payroll cost / overtime facts | Read only | M10 (post-lock snapshots only) |
| Appraisal ratings / disciplinary cases | Read only | M08 / M09 |
| Transfer / promotion pipeline | Read only | M05 / M06 |
| Pension forecasting inputs | Read only | M11 (M14 visualises forecasts) |
| Document storage | Reference | M13 stores export objects; M14 creates refs |
| Operational RBAC catalog & auth | Consume | Platform; M14 mirrors into RLS policies |
| **Sanctioned strength / posts / roster points** | **In (hosted reference, FR-19)** | **No M01–M13 module owns posts; M14 hosts the establishment reference; Establishment Officer authors values, M14 reports compliance** |
| **Source-to-mart data contracts** | **In (owned, FR-21)** | **M14 owns the versioned contract; each source module co-signs its schema promise** |
| **DPDP rectification/erasure across analytics estate** | **In (owned pipeline, FR-20)** | **M01/DPO trigger; M14 propagates to its derived copies** |
| Editing a source record | Out | Drill-through is read-only; edits happen in owning module |
| KPI / dashboard / report definitions | In (owned) | M14 owns analytics artefacts |
| ETL / data marts / materialised views / bitemporal snapshots | In (owned) | M14 owns the analytics layer |
| Adjudicating reservation/roster decisions or approving posts | Out | Establishment/administration function; M14 reports, never approves |

### 2.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- M14 reads from source modules through a **governed mart layer** fed by **versioned source data contracts (FR-21)** and **Debezium CDC**, refreshed on a schedule (default near-real-time for operational marts, daily for heavy demographic/financial marts); it does **not** issue ad-hoc cross-joins against live OLTP tables for dashboard rendering.
- The operational **RBAC + org-unit hierarchy is authoritative**; M14 derives RLS scope from it and re-derives on each session — it never invents its own access model. **RLS policy and embed-token mutations are themselves maker-checked (FR-04, FR-15).**
- All sensitive financial figures (payroll cost, salary) are sourced from **locked/finalised** snapshots only; in-progress payroll is excluded from cost analytics unless explicitly running a "what-if" view fed by M10 FR-18.
- Reservation-roster, cadre, and seniority logic uses the **same canonical reference data** as the owning modules; **sanctioned strength and roster points are sourced from the establishment/position reference (FR-19)**, which is the named denominator authority.
- Predictive models are **advisory**; outputs are labelled as estimates with methodology, **fairness assessment, and a prohibited-use clause**, never as administrative decisions, and **individual scores are friction-gated**.
- Money math in marts uses fixed-point decimal; aggregates round at presentation only.
- Single legal entity per deployment; the mart schema is entity-aware (`legal_entity_id`) for future multi-entity.
- **Snapshots are bitemporal**: corrections create new knowledge-versions rather than mutating history (FR-23).
- **Reconciliation is watermark-relative**: a mart is compared to the source *as of the same watermark*, not wall-clock now (FR-03).
- **The analytics estate is a controlled second copy of personal data** with a rectification/erasure pipeline (FR-20) reconciled against statutory retention overrides.

All access is additionally **row-level scoped** by org_unit subtree and reporting line (FR-M14-04) **and metric-level suppressed** (FR-M14-17). A role grant never overrides RLS or suppression; the effective dataset is the intersection of capability grant, data scope, and privacy threshold.

---

## 4. Shared Application Foundation

M14 inherits the Shared Foundation (§5 of `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`) verbatim:

- **Architecture:** React + TypeScript (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) frontend with a charting/visualisation layer; REST API under `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL primary datastore with a dedicated **analytics schema** (marts + materialised views + **bitemporal snapshot store** + **partitioned append-only access ledger**); object storage (M13) for generated export files; deployed at CGG Data Centre.
- **Auth:** OIDC/SSO + MFA; JWT access tokens; **RBAC + row-level scoping by org_unit is enforced inside every analytics query** (FR-M14-04), with **metric-level complementary suppression** layered on top (FR-M14-17).
- **Canonical error envelope:** `{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "...", "field": "..." }, "requestId": "..." }`.
- **Standard error codes:** VALIDATION_ERROR(400), AUTH_REQUIRED(401), FORBIDDEN(403), NOT_FOUND(404), CONFLICT(409), RATE_LIMITED(429), INTERNAL_ERROR(500), UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE(503) + M14-specific (§8.3).
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP ASVS, TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest, full audit trail (including **view/export** events for sensitive analytics), PII minimisation, DPDP Act 2023 alignment (**incl. rectification/erasure propagation, FR-20**), statutory retention.
- **NFR baseline:** P95 API < 500ms (mart-backed reads), dashboard P95 < 2.5s; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h. Analytics-specific NFRs in §9.

**Shared entities referenced (not redefined):** `employees`, `users`, `org_units`, `designations`, `cadres`, `pay_scales`, `roles`, `permissions`, `service_register_events`, `documents`, `notifications`, `audit_log`, `workflow_instances/tasks`. M14 reads facts owned by M01–M13 through the mart layer and references export objects in `documents`.

### 4.1 ADR-01 — Hybrid Build-vs-Buy Architecture Decision (council §4 focused pass, R15)

**Decision:** M14 is a **hybrid stack**. The governed data-access core is **built**; commodity presentation/distribution machinery is **adopted** and never touches the marts directly.

| Layer | Build or Buy | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Governed KPI registry + DSL + versioning** (E03/E04, FR-02) | **Build** | Differentiated; no off-the-shelf equivalent meets the governance bar |
| **RLS query-rewriter + field masking + complementary suppression** (FR-04, FR-17) | **Build** | Security-critical; off-the-shelf BI is *weakest* exactly here and bolting RLS on widens the leak surface |
| **Freshness / `dataFreshness` contract + reconciliation** (FR-12, FR-03) | **Build** | Cross-cutting correctness contract |
| **Cross-module drill-through authz** (FR-10) and **access/audit ledger semantics** (E16) | **Build** | Governs exactly who may cross from aggregate to record |
| **Bitemporal snapshot store** (FR-23) | **Build** | Statutory reproducibility primitive |
| Chart rendering, grid/layout engine | **Buy/adopt** (e.g. ECharts/AG-Grid-class libraries) | Commodity; receive already-scoped, already-masked, already-freshness-stamped result sets |
| PDF/XLSX/CSV export rendering | **Buy/adopt** | Commodity rendering of governed result sets |
| Cron scheduler | **Buy/adopt** | Commodity orchestration |
| NL-to-query LLM orchestration | **Buy/adopt** (on-prem LLM, §FR-15) | Orchestration adopted; the **semantic mapping and RLS rewrite remain built** |

**Binding constraint:** only the built governed core holds database credentials. Every adopted library — charting, export, scheduler, NL orchestrator, embed renderer — consumes a result set that has **already** been scope-filtered, field-masked, suppression-applied, and freshness-stamped, and can never reach a mart or the OLTP sources. This collapses the build cost while preserving the security posture and shrinks the embed (R10) and NL (R12) attack surface to thin renderers over the governed core.

### 5.6 Data Integrity Rules

1. **Governed metrics only:** every measure-bearing `dashboard_widget` must reference an `ACTIVE kpi_definition` or a `saved_report`; inline ad-hoc formulae are rejected at publish.
2. **Single active KPI version:** at most one `ACTIVE` `kpi_definition` per `kpi_code`; activating a new version RETIRES the prior.
3. **RLS is mandatory:** no analytics query executes without an applied `rls_scope_policy`; unresolved scope returns 403 `RLS_SCOPE_UNRESOLVED`, never an unfiltered result.
4. **Read-only source:** M14 holds **no foreign key write** into M01–M13 tables; marts are derived; drill-through is read-only navigation.
5. **Freshness honesty:** every `kpi_snapshot`, `report_execution`, and rendered widget carries a `data_as_of`; STALE/DEGRADED/FAILED marts flag results `is_partial=true` with a staleness badge.
6. **Snapshot reproducibility (bitemporal — v2):** `kpi_snapshot` is keyed by `(kpi_id, kpi_version, scope, period_key, knowledge_time)`. Recomputation on the same mart watermark and the same definition yields the same value. A restatement adds a new `knowledge_time` row and marks the prior `is_superseded=true`; it never mutates a past row. An "as-of-knowledge" read returns the row whose `knowledge_time` is the latest ≤ the requested instant (FR-23).
7. **Export lineage:** every `report_execution` with `status=COMPLETED` has a `document_id` (M13) and a matching `analytics_access_log` EXPORT row with `row_count`.
8. **Sensitivity gating:** a `RESTRICTED` field cannot be rendered/exported to a role masked by `field_mask_json`; masked fields are excluded (export header notes masking).
9. **Recipient validity:** `report_schedule`/`alert_rule` recipients are validated against current RBAC + scope at run time; out-of-scope recipients are dropped and logged.
10. **SoD on publication (extended — v2):** maker ≠ checker for: `kpi_definition` activation; `dashboard` publication of COMPLIANCE/EXECUTIVE; **`rls_scope_policy` create/update; `embed_token` issuance; `prediction_model` activation.** Each routes through `workflow_instances`.
11. **Watermark-relative reconciliation (redefined — v2):** for reconcilable KPIs, the mart value at watermark W is compared to the source *as of the same watermark W*, not to live "now". Variance beyond the per-KPI `reconciliation_tolerance`, **sustained beyond `reconcile_grace_minutes`**, flags the mart DEGRADED and alerts. Transient CDC lag does not flag DEGRADED.
12. **Append-only with bitemporal restatement (reconciled — v2):** `analytics_access_log`, `datamart_refresh_log`, and `kpi_snapshot` are append-only. Historical correctness is preserved by **adding knowledge-versions** (rule 6), not by mutating or deleting prior rows — resolving the v1 append-only-vs-backfill contradiction.
13. **Prediction labelling & governance (extended — v2):** every `prediction_result` in UI/exports is labelled advisory with `model_id`, `version`, `confidence`, `data_as_of`; **probabilistic models must have `fairness_status=PASSED` (or `WAIVED_WITH_REASON`) and a published model card before activation; individual scores are friction-gated; predictions are never written back to source modules and must not be the sole/primary basis for any administrative action.**
14. **Bounded outputs:** all list/report endpoints paginated (max page 100); reports respect `row_limit`; over-cap exports chunk or reject with `EXPORT_ROW_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.
15. **Metric-level privacy (new — v2):** every aggregate read (tile/chart/export/drill) applies the active `suppression_policy`: any cell whose `cell_size`/denominator `< k` is suppressed or banded, **and its complements across overlapping scopes/periods are suppressed** so a hidden cell cannot be recovered by subtraction. Suppressed aggregate access returns/annotates `SMALL_CELL_SUPPRESSED` / `COMPLEMENTARY_SUPPRESSION_APPLIED`.
16. **DPDP rectifiability (new — v2):** a `data_subject_change` for an employee propagates to all derived copies — marts, `kpi_snapshot` (restated bitemporally or redacted), `prediction_result` (purged), `report_execution` artefacts (marked `REDACTED` in M13) — and reconciles against statutory retention; where retention legally overrides erasure, `status=BLOCKED_RETENTION` with a recorded `legal_basis`.
17. **Effective-dated targets (new — v2):** target-vs-actual and RAG use the `kpi_target_history` value whose `[effective_from, effective_to)` covers the period being shown, never today's value for a past period.
18. **Embed-token transport (new — v2):** an embed credential is never accepted in a URL path/query; it is presented in a header or exchanged from a short-lived code; tokens are revocable, rotatable, and re-validated per render; CSP `frame-ancestors` is enforced from `allowed_frame_ancestors`.

## 6. Functional Requirements

> FR-01…FR-16 are carried forward from v1 with v2 amendments integrated (marked **v2**). FR-17…FR-23 are new. Each FR retains ID, Module, Primary Role(s), User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Business Rules, Data Model References, API References, UI Behavior Notes, Edge Cases, and a full Low-Level Design table.

### FR-M14-01 — Role-Based Dashboard Framework & Layout Engine

- **Module:** M14-F01
- **Primary Role(s):** Analytics Administrator (build/publish), All roles (consume, scoped)
- **User Story:** As an Analytics Administrator, I want to compose role-targeted dashboards from a widget catalog and publish them, so that each persona lands on a relevant, governed, permission-scoped home view.
- **Description:** A dashboard authoring and rendering engine. A `dashboard` is a responsive grid of `dashboard_widget`s, each bound to a governed KPI or saved report. Dashboards are role-targeted and category-tagged; users personalise via `saved_view` without altering the published template. Publication of COMPLIANCE/EXECUTIVE dashboards is maker-checker. Rendering always applies RLS (FR-04), **metric-level suppression (FR-17)**, and freshness in **role-adaptive language (FR-12)**. **v2:** every consumer KPI tile renders the plain-language `description`/`plain_language_note`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An admin can create a dashboard, add widgets from the catalog, arrange them on a responsive grid, and save as DRAFT.
  - AC2: Publishing a COMPLIANCE/EXECUTIVE dashboard requires a checker (`published_by ≠ created_by`); other categories may self-publish within authority.
  - AC3: A consuming user sees only widgets they are permitted to view; unauthorised widgets are omitted (not shown empty).
  - AC4: A user can save a personal `saved_view` and set it default without modifying the template.
  - AC5: Each rendered dashboard shows a global `data_as_of` and per-widget freshness state in language matched to the viewer's role.
  - AC6: Every dashboard view writes an `analytics_access_log` (VIEW_DASHBOARD) entry **asynchronously** (§8.1).
  - **AC7 (v2):** Every consumer KPI tile displays the governed plain-language definition (what counts / what doesn't) inline or on a one-tap info affordance.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: A measure-bound widget must reference an ACTIVE `kpi_definition` or `saved_report`; orphaned bindings block publication.
  - BR2: A dashboard cannot be published if any bound KPI is RETIRED/DRAFT.
  - BR3: Personalisation is per-user; a user cannot change another user's default view.
  - BR4: Archiving a dashboard preserves its `saved_view`s read-only for audit.
  - **BR5 (v2):** Consumer dashboards default to the trimmed widget palette (no MAP/FUNNEL); the authoring catalog retains them (§14).
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `dashboard`, `dashboard_widget` | compose/render |
| `kpi_definition`, `saved_report` | widget bindings |
| `saved_view` | personalisation |
| `suppression_policy` | metric-level privacy on render |
| `analytics_access_log`, `audit_log` | view + config audit (async) |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/dashboards` | create dashboard |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/dashboards/{id}/widgets` | add widget |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/dashboards/{id}:publish` | publish (checker) |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/dashboards/{id}/render` | render scoped, suppressed data |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/saved-views` | save personal view |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Drag-and-drop grid editor with widget palette; live preview against own scope; responsive breakpoints; per-widget freshness badge in role-adaptive copy; plain-language KPI note on tiles; "Save as my view"/"Set default". Publish disabled for makers on gated categories.
- **Edge Cases:** Bound KPI retired after publish (widget shows "metric retired" placeholder + alerts steward); user with no scope sees explanatory empty state; suppressed tile shows "below privacy threshold"; very wide dashboards lazy-load below the fold.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `DashboardController`, `WidgetCatalogService`, `DashboardRenderer`, `SavedViewService`, `LayoutValidator`, `SuppressionDecorator` |
| Backend Flow | Validate layout/bindings → persist DRAFT → on publish run SoD + binding-active checks in a transaction → on render resolve RLS scope, fan-out widget queries to marts, apply suppression, attach freshness, assemble payload; enqueue async access-log |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE dashboard/widget; INSERT saved_view; SELECT from marts (RLS-filtered, suppressed); async INSERT access_log |
| Validation | Binding existence/active; layout schema; category publish authority; unique dashboard_code |
| Authorization | Analytics Admin author; checker publish; consumer scoped render |
| State Changes & Side Effects | dashboard.status DRAFT→PUBLISHED→ARCHIVED; async access_log + audit_log; widget cache warm |
| Failure Handling | Orphan binding → 409 `WIDGET_BINDING_INVALID`; maker publish gated → 403 `PUBLISH_REQUIRES_CHECKER`; mart down → widget degraded per FR-12; small group → `SMALL_CELL_SUPPRESSED` |
| Dependencies | FR-02 (KPI), FR-04 (RLS), FR-12 (freshness), FR-17 (suppression) |
| Test Guidance | Publish SoD; scope-omits-widget; saved-view isolation; freshness badge; plain-language render; suppressed tile |

### FR-M14-02 — KPI Definition & Calculation Engine (Versioned, Effective-Dated Targets)

- **Module:** M14-F02
- **Primary Role(s):** Analytics Administrator (define), Analytics Administrator/steward (approve)
- **User Story:** As an Analytics Administrator, I want to define KPIs once — formula, grain, allowed dimensions, sensitivity, with versioning, effective-dated targets, and approval — so that every dashboard and report computes the same number the same way and never splices definition versions in a trend.
- **Description:** Maintains the `kpi_definition` registry and a deterministic calculation engine. A KPI declares `source_mart_id`, a safe aggregation `expression`, unit, grain, allowed dimensions, sensitivity, reconciliation target/tolerance, and a `definition_hash`. Targets are **effective-dated in `kpi_target_history` (E17)**. The engine computes values on demand and materialises **bitemporal, version-stamped** `kpi_snapshot` rows (FR-23). Definitions are versioned; activation retires the prior. Publication is maker-checker. **v2:** every snapshot stores `kpi_version` + `definition_hash`; a trend crossing a definition change renders a version-change marker and blocks silent cross-version aggregation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A KPI can be created with expression, grain, unit, allowed dimensions, sensitivity, reconciliation target/tolerance in DRAFT.
  - AC2: An expression referencing an unknown mart column or disallowed function is rejected with precise location.
  - AC3: Activating a new version sets the prior ACTIVE to RETIRED; no two ACTIVE versions share a `kpi_code`.
  - AC4: Computing a KPI writes a reproducible bitemporal `kpi_snapshot` with `kpi_version`, `definition_hash`, `valid_time`, `knowledge_time`, `data_as_of`, `is_partial`.
  - AC5: A KPI cannot slice by a dimension not in `dimensions_allowed`.
  - AC6: Activation requires `approved_by ≠ created_by`.
  - **AC7 (v2):** A trend that spans rows of differing `kpi_version` renders a discontinuity marker; an aggregation across versions returns `CROSS_VERSION_AGGREGATION_BLOCKED` unless the user acknowledges.
  - **AC8 (v2):** Target-vs-actual uses the `kpi_target_history` value in force for the period shown, not today's value.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: A KPI referenced by any published widget/report cannot be deleted; only RETIRED.
  - BR2: RESTRICTED KPIs inherit field masking; they cannot be embedded in PUBLIC dashboards.
  - BR3: Reconcilable KPIs declare a reconciliation target/object; **variance is evaluated watermark-relative (FR-03)**.
  - BR4: Snapshots are computed only on marts with `health_status ∈ {HEALTHY,STALE}`; FAILED marts yield no snapshot.
  - **BR5 (v2):** Every snapshot carries the producing `kpi_version` and `definition_hash`; the pair is immutable on the row.
- **Data Model References:**

- **UI Behavior Notes:** KPI editor with expression linting, "test against mart sample" trace, dimension picker, effective-dated target timeline, sensitivity selector, version timeline; trend charts show version-change flags; Activate disabled for makers.
- **Edge Cases:** Division by zero in ratio KPI (returns null with reason, not error); dimension absent in mart row (grouped "Unknown"); retroactive mart backfill creates a **new knowledge-version snapshot** (never mutates — FR-23); cross-version trend aggregation requires acknowledgement.

### FR-M14-03 — Analytics Data Layer (Semantic Model, Data Marts & ETL Refresh)

- **Module:** M14-F03
- **Primary Role(s):** Data Engineer (operate), Analytics Administrator (model), System Administrator (config)
- **User Story:** As a Data Engineer, I want governed data marts refreshed on a schedule with watermarks, **watermark-relative reconciliation**, and health tracking, so that dashboards read fast, consistent, permission-scoped data without hammering OLTP.
- **Description:** Defines and operates the analytics layer: a `analytics_datamart` registry, each governed by a `source_data_contract` (FR-21) and fed by Debezium CDC/incremental/batch. The ETL refreshes marts on `refresh_cron`, logs to `datamart_refresh_log`, advances watermarks, recomputes affected `kpi_snapshot`s, and updates `health_status`. **v2:** reconciliation compares mart-at-watermark to source-as-of-the-same-watermark, with per-KPI tolerance and a sustained-variance grace window before DEGRADED.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A mart can be registered with grain, sources, **governing contract**, refresh strategy, cron, and freshness SLA.
  - AC2: A scheduled refresh runs incrementally from the last watermark and records rows read/written, duration, new watermark.
  - AC3: If `now − last_refreshed_at > freshness_sla_minutes`, the mart is STALE and dependent surfaces show staleness.
  - AC4: A failed refresh marks the mart FAILED, retains last good data, logs the error, raises an alert.
  - **AC5 (v2, redefined):** Reconciliation compares mart-at-watermark W to source-as-of-W; variance beyond the per-KPI tolerance **sustained beyond `reconcile_grace_minutes`** marks DEGRADED and alerts. Transient CDC lag does not flag DEGRADED.
  - AC6: A Data Engineer can trigger a manual/backfill refresh; it is logged with `run_type`; backfill creates new knowledge-version snapshots (FR-23).
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Marts read source modules **read-only** through contracted views; M14 holds no write FK into M01–M13.
  - BR2: PII-bearing marts (`contains_pii=true`) are RESTRICTED and field-masked per RLS.
  - BR3: A FAILED mart cannot serve dashboards; consumers fall back to last good snapshot with a clear stale flag (FR-12).
  - BR4: Incremental refresh is idempotent; re-running with the same watermark produces no duplicates.
  - **BR5 (v2):** A mart whose `source_data_contract` is BREACHED is held from refresh and alerts (FR-21).
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `analytics_datamart` | registry/freshness |
| `source_data_contract` | governing schema promise |
| `datamart_refresh_log` | run history + reconcile variance |
| `kpi_snapshot` | recompute targets (bitemporal) |
| `audit_log` | config + manual-run audit |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/marts` | register mart |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/marts/{id}:refresh` | trigger refresh (manual/backfill) |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/marts/{id}/health` | freshness/health |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/marts/{id}/refresh-log` | run history (paginated) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Data Engineer console with health chips (HEALTHY/STALE/DEGRADED/FAILED), last refresh, watermark, next run, contract status; manual refresh/backfill; refresh-log timeline with error detail; **watermark-relative reconciliation variance panel** with grace-window state.
- **Edge Cases:** Source schema change breaks ETL (contract test fails in CI before prod; runtime → FAILED + last good); CDC stream gap (watermark stall → STALE); concurrent manual + scheduled refresh (second queued).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `MartRegistryController`, `EtlOrchestrator`, `IncrementalLoader`, `MaterializedViewRefresher`, `FreshnessMonitor`, `WatermarkReconciliationChecker` |
| Backend Flow | On cron/manual → acquire mart lock → read from watermark via contracted view → upsert idempotently → advance watermark → recompute affected snapshots → run watermark-relative reconciliation with grace → update health → write refresh_log |
| Data Operations | UPSERT mart rows; INSERT refresh_log (with reconcile_variance); UPDATE mart watermark/health; recompute snapshots |
| Validation | Idempotency key on watermark; grain uniqueness; source read-only assertion; contract validity |
| Authorization | Data Engineer operate; Analytics Admin model; Sys Admin config; Auditor read status |
| State Changes & Side Effects | mart.health transitions; refresh_log append; snapshot recompute; alert on FAILED/sustained-DEGRADED |
| Failure Handling | ETL error → FAILED + 500 `MART_REFRESH_FAILED` + retain last good; lock contention → 409 `MART_REFRESH_IN_PROGRESS`; contract breach → `SOURCE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION` |
| Dependencies | FR-21 (contracts), FR-02 snapshots, FR-11 alerts, FR-23 bitemporal |
| Test Guidance | Idempotent load; SLA detection; **watermark-relative reconciliation (no false DEGRADED under CDC lag)**; grace window; last-good fallback |

### FR-M14-04 — Row-Level Security, Permission-Scoped Access & Maker-Checker Policy Governance

- **Module:** M14-F04
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (maker), Analytics Administrator (checker), All roles (enforced)
- **User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want row-level security that mirrors RBAC and the org hierarchy, **with maker-checker on any policy change and a preview-as-role diff**, so that every query returns only entitled data and the single most dangerous mutation (opening scope to `TRUE`) cannot ship unchecked.
- **Description:** Defines `rls_scope_policy` rows mapping each role to a scope type and a parameterised filter, plus optional column masking. On each request the engine resolves the user's effective scope and injects the filter into every mart query; scope is re-derived per session. RLS is non-bypassable. **v2:** policy create/update is a maker-checker workflow — a maker drafts, the system computes a **preview-as-role data-exposure diff** (before/after row counts and sample), and a different checker approves before the version becomes ACTIVE; the change is immutably audited.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A manager's dashboard/report returns only direct+indirect reports.
  - AC2: An HR officer sees only delegated org units; out-of-scope rows are filtered out.
  - AC3: A RESTRICTED field is masked/excluded for roles without field access; export header notes masking.
  - AC4: A request with no applicable policy returns 403 `RLS_SCOPE_UNRESOLVED` and is logged.
  - AC5: Scope resolution reflects org-hierarchy changes within the configured TTL (default 15 min).
  - AC6: An automated scope-leak test proves no role returns a record outside its scope across all marts.
  - **AC7 (v2):** A policy create/update is saved as DRAFT→PENDING_APPROVAL; it cannot become ACTIVE without `approved_by ≠ created_by`; an attempt to self-approve returns 403 `RLS_POLICY_REQUIRES_CHECKER`.
  - **AC8 (v2):** The approval screen shows a preview-as-role diff (resolved filter, before/after row counts) captured into `preview_diff_json`; broadening to ENTERPRISE/`TRUE` is flagged prominently.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Effective dataset = intersection of capability grant (RBAC) and data scope (RLS); neither overrides the other; **suppression (FR-17) is applied after**.
  - BR2: ENTERPRISE scope is restricted to Executive/Auditor/Analytics Admin per policy.
  - BR3: Auditor has read-all scope but inherits field masking unless explicitly granted.
  - BR4: Embedded-BI and API queries (FR-15) carry the same RLS; tokens are scoped, not bypass keys.
  - **BR5 (v2):** Only one ACTIVE policy per (role, mart); activating a new version SUPERSEDES the prior; rollback re-activates a prior version through the same checker path.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `rls_scope_policy` | role→scope mapping + approval workflow |
| `org_units`, `employees` (M01 ref) | scope resolution |
| `roles`/`permissions` (ref) | capability grant |
| `workflow_instances` | maker-checker routing |
| `analytics_access_log` | scope snapshot per access |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/rls-policies` | create/update policy (DRAFT, maker) |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/rls-policies/{id}:preview-as-role` | compute exposure diff |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/rls-policies/{id}:approve` | approve (checker ≠ maker) |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/rls-policies/resolve` | resolve my effective scope (debug/self) |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/rls-policies` | list policies |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Admin policy editor mapping roles to scope types; **mandatory "preview as role/user" diff** before submit; masking config per RESTRICTED field; checker approval queue with broadening warnings; immutable change history.
- **Edge Cases:** User with multiple roles (highest-priority scope wins by `priority`); manager with no reports (empty scope, explanatory state); delegated units changed mid-session (re-resolved at TTL); checker = maker attempt (blocked).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RlsPolicyController`, `ScopeResolver`, `QueryRewriter`, `FieldMaskService`, `PreviewAsRoleService`, `PolicyApprovalWorkflow` |
| Backend Flow | On request → load roles → resolve scope params → select highest-priority ACTIVE policy per mart → rewrite query with predicate + masks → execute → async snapshot scope to access_log. On policy change → DRAFT → compute exposure diff → route to checker → on approve activate version, supersede prior |
| Data Operations | SELECT policies; SELECT org subtree (TTL cached); INSERT policy version; no writes to source |
| Validation | Policy existence; parameter resolvability; mask config; SoD on approval |
| Authorization | Sys Admin maker; Analytics Admin/authorised checker; everyone enforced; Auditor read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | policy DRAFT→PENDING_APPROVAL→ACTIVE/REJECTED→SUPERSEDED; immutable audit; async access_log |
| Failure Handling | Unresolved scope → 403 `RLS_SCOPE_UNRESOLVED`; self-approval → 403 `RLS_POLICY_REQUIRES_CHECKER`; missing subtree → 503 `SCOPE_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` |
| Dependencies | M01 org hierarchy; workflow engine; FR-02/03/08/17 (all queries) |
| Test Guidance | Cross-role scope-leak matrix; multi-role priority; field masking on export; TTL re-resolution; **maker-checker enforcement + preview diff correctness** |

### FR-M14-05 — Workforce Analytics (Establishment-Pinned)

- **Module:** M14-F05
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Executive
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want workforce analytics — headcount, demographics, diversity, attrition, **sanctioned-vs-filled vacancy pinned to the establishment reference**, cadre distribution, age/retirement profile, span of control — so that I can plan establishment, recruitment, and succession with accurate, scoped numbers.
- **Description:** Delivers the core workforce KPI suite over `MART_HEADCOUNT` and dimensions, with **vacancy = sanctioned strength (from `establishment_position`, FR-19) − filled**. All KPIs are governed (FR-02), scoped (FR-04), and suppressed (FR-17). Retirement profile is deterministic (FR-13).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Headcount tiles show active count by scope with drill-down org_unit→office→designation.
  - AC2: Attrition rate computes leavers/average headcount over the window, separating retirements/resignations/terminations, **excluding internal transfers**.
  - AC3: Vacancy view shows sanctioned (from establishment reference) vs filled vs vacant by cadre with vacancy %.
  - AC4: Retirement profile lists counts retiring within 1/3/5 years by cadre, drillable to permitted individuals.
  - AC5: Span-of-control highlights managers exceeding configurable thresholds.
  - AC6: Diversity composition shows reservation-category and gender mix vs roster targets; **small cells suppressed/banded (FR-17)**.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: **Sanctioned strength comes from `establishment_position` (FR-19); filled = active employees mapped to sanctioned posts.** Missing establishment data raises `ESTABLISHMENT_REFERENCE_MISSING` (notice).
  - BR2: Retirement age/date uses canonical M01 DOB + cadre rules; M14 does not redefine retirement age.
  - BR3: Attrition excludes internal transfers (M05).
  - BR4: Demographic individual drill-through is RLS-gated, suppressed, and audited.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `analytics_datamart` (MART_HEADCOUNT, dimensions) | source |
| `establishment_position` (E21) | sanctioned-strength denominator |
| `kpi_definition`/`kpi_snapshot` | governed metrics/trends |
| `employees`,`org_units`,`cadres`,`designations` (ref) | grain/dimensions |
| `prediction_result` | succession/retirement risk overlay |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/workforce/headcount` | headcount by scope/dimension |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/workforce/attrition` | attrition metrics |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/workforce/vacancy` | sanctioned (establishment) vs filled |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/workforce/retirement-profile` | retirement horizon |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/workforce/span-of-control` | reports per manager |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Workforce dashboard with KPI tiles, attrition trend, vacancy bar (sanctioned/filled/vacant), retirement heatmap, span-of-control table with threshold flags, diversity donut vs target; all drillable; freshness + suppression badges per tile.
- **Edge Cases:** Employee on long suspension (counted per policy flag); post with sanctioned strength but no occupant mapping (flagged data-quality); manager change mid-period (span as-of date); establishment reference absent for a unit (vacancy shows notice, not zero).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `WorkforceAnalyticsController`, `HeadcountService`, `AttritionService`, `VacancyService` (establishment-joined), `RetirementProfiler`, `SpanCalculator` |
| Backend Flow | Resolve RLS scope → query MART_HEADCOUNT + dimensions → join `establishment_position` for sanctioned strength → compute governed KPIs/snapshots → apply suppression → join prediction overlays → assemble with freshness |
| Data Operations | SELECT marts + establishment reference (RLS-filtered, suppressed); no writes |
| Validation | Dimension allowed; window validity; sanctioned-vs-filled integrity; establishment presence |
| Authorization | HR/Dept Head/Exec scoped; Employee excluded from aggregates |
| State Changes & Side Effects | snapshot writes; async access_log on drill-through |
| Failure Handling | Stale mart → partial; missing establishment → `ESTABLISHMENT_REFERENCE_MISSING` (200 notice); small cell → suppressed |
| Dependencies | FR-02, FR-03, FR-04, FR-10, FR-13, FR-17, FR-19 |
| Test Guidance | Attrition excludes transfers; **establishment-pinned vacancy math**; retirement boundaries; span thresholds; suppression on diversity |

### FR-M14-06 — Operational Analytics by Module

- **Module:** M14-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Reporting Manager, Department Head
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want per-module operational analytics — leave/absenteeism, attendance, payroll cost & overtime, training coverage, appraisal distribution, disciplinary aging, transfer/promotion pipeline, pension forecasting — so that I can monitor operations and act on outliers within my scope.
- **Description:** Domain dashboards reading domain marts (Leave/Attendance from M03/M04; Payroll from M10 **locked**; Training M07; Appraisal M08; Disciplinary M09; Transfer/Promotion M05/M06; Pension M11). Each is governed, scoped, suppressed.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Leave dashboard shows absenteeism rate and LWP days by office with trend, drillable to employee (scoped, suppressed).
  - AC2: Payroll cost analytics read only LOCKED snapshots; in-progress runs excluded.
  - AC3: Training dashboard shows mandatory-training completion % and skill-gap heatmap by competency×org_unit.
  - AC4: Appraisal dashboard shows rating distribution and flags calibration outliers; never exposes individual ratings to unauthorised roles.
  - AC5: Disciplinary dashboard shows case-aging buckets (0-30/31-90/90+) without exposing detail beyond permission.
  - AC6: Transfer/promotion pipeline shows funnel by stage with ageing and SLA.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Each operational KPI maps to a single owning-module mart; M14 aggregates published facts, never recomputes domain rules.
  - BR2: Sensitive domains (payroll, disciplinary, appraisal) are RESTRICTED; masking, suppression, and drill-gating apply.
  - BR3: Pension forecast figures sourced from M11; M14 visualises, does not compute terminal benefits.
  - BR4: Overtime analytics require attendance+payroll alignment; mismatched periods flagged, not silently merged.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| Domain marts (LEAVE/ATTENDANCE/PAYROLL/TRAINING/APPRAISAL/DISCIPLINARY/TRANSFER/PROMOTION/PENSION) | sources |
| `kpi_definition`/`kpi_snapshot` | governed metrics |
| `suppression_policy` | small-cell privacy |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Tabbed operational suite, one tab per domain; KPI tiles + primary chart + outlier table; RESTRICTED tabs visible only to authorised roles; freshness per domain mart; suppression badges.
- **Edge Cases:** Payroll mart stale (last locked period + stale badge); training competency added mid-period (skill-gap recomputed); disciplinary case sealed/confidential (excluded per M09 flag).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |

### FR-M14-07 — Compliance & Statutory Dashboards (Establishment-Pinned)

- **Module:** M14-F07
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Executive, Auditor
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want compliance & statutory dashboards — reservation roster compliance (pinned to sanctioned strength/roster points), mandatory-training status, SR verification status, pending approvals & SLA breaches — so that I can demonstrate compliance and clear backlogs before they become audit findings.
- **Description:** Statutory-grade dashboards: **Reservation Roster Compliance** (sanctioned vs filled by category vs roster points from `establishment_position`, FR-19); **Mandatory Training**; **SR Verification Status** (read from M12); **Pending Approvals & SLA Breaches** (workflow tasks). Designed for audit export with as-of timestamps, methodology notes, and **bitemporal "as-of-knowledge" reproducibility (FR-23)**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Reservation dashboard shows category-wise sanctioned/filled/backlog and a roster-point compliance indicator, pinned to the establishment reference.
  - AC2: Mandatory-training dashboard lists overdue employees by mandate with completion %.
  - AC3: SR verification dashboard shows verified/pending/overdue counts from M12 (read-only) with drill to permitted employee SR status.
  - AC4: SLA dashboard aggregates pending `workflow_tasks` across modules into aging buckets with breach flags.
  - AC5: Every compliance view exports to PDF/Excel with `data_as_of`, scope, methodology footnote, **and an as-of-knowledge stamp** (FR-09/FR-23).
  - AC6: Auditor can view all compliance dashboards, the access log, and the anomaly queue.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Reservation category rules/roster points use canonical reference + establishment data; M14 reports compliance, does not adjudicate.
  - BR2: SR verification status is read from M12; M14 never writes SR.
  - BR3: SLA thresholds per workflow type are configured centrally and effective-dated (E17); breaches are derived.
  - BR4: Compliance dashboards default to enterprise/department scope; employee role has no access.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `analytics_datamart` (compliance/SR/workflow marts) | sources |
| `establishment_position` | reservation denominator |
| `service_register_events` (M12 ref) | SR verification status |
| `workflow_tasks` (ref) | pending/SLA |
| `kpi_definition`/`kpi_snapshot` | compliance KPIs |

| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/compliance/sr-verification` | SR verification status |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/compliance/sla-breaches` | pending & SLA aging |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Compliance suite with roster table (sanctioned/filled/backlog/compliance %), overdue training list, SR verification board, SLA breach heatmap by module×age bucket; prominent export-for-audit; methodology footnotes; as-of + as-of-knowledge stamps.
- **Edge Cases:** Reservation reference updated (recompute against new points, prior knowledge-version retained); SR mart lagging M12 (stale badge); workflow type without configured SLA (excluded with data-quality flag); establishment data missing (`ESTABLISHMENT_REFERENCE_MISSING`).
- **LLD:**

### FR-M14-08 — Self-Service Report Builder (Ad-Hoc Query & Saved Reports)

- **Module:** M14-F08
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Reporting Manager (team scope)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to build ad-hoc reports from a governed semantic model and save them, so that I can answer new questions without IT tickets — within my data scope and the privacy threshold.
- **Description:** A no-code report designer over the semantic layer (FR-03). Users pick a base mart, select fields/measures, add filters, group/aggregate, sort, preview, and save as `saved_report`. All queries are RLS-scoped, suppression-applied, and bounded by `row_limit`. **v2:** a clear in-builder explanation of the aggregated-vs-detail RESTRICTED rule reduces `FIELD_NOT_PERMITTED` confusion (council D).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A user can select a mart, choose fields, add filters/grouping/aggregations, and preview the first page.
  - AC2: The builder only exposes fields/dimensions the user's role may see (masked fields hidden, with an inline explanation).
  - AC3: A report can be saved with visibility and reused; SHARED_SCOPE respects each viewer's RLS at run time.
  - AC4: A query exceeding `row_limit` is rejected or offered chunked export (FR-09).
  - AC5: Preview and saved reports always show `data_as_of`.
  - AC6: A non-aggregated report over a RESTRICTED mart requires elevated authority or is blocked, **with a plain-language reason**; aggregates over RESTRICTED marts are allowed but suppression-applied.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Report definitions reference the semantic model; raw SQL entry is not exposed.
  - BR2: SHARED_SCOPE/PUBLISHED visibility is applied at view-time as RLS intersection.
  - BR3: Aggregated reports over RESTRICTED marts are permitted (no row-level PII) but **subject to FR-17 suppression**; detail-level requires authority.
  - BR4: Saving/publishing is audited; PUBLISHED requires steward approval.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `saved_report` | definition |
| `analytics_datamart` (semantic) | base dataset |
| `rls_scope_policy` | scope/masking |

### FR-M14-09 — Scheduled Report Distribution & Multi-Format Export

- **Module:** M14-F09
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Analytics Administrator
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to schedule saved reports for automatic generation and delivery in PDF/Excel/CSV — optionally bursted per org unit — so that stakeholders receive timely, scope-correct reports without manual effort.
- **Description:** Attaches a `report_schedule` (cron, format, recipients, `scope_mode`, optional `burst_dimension`, channel) to a `saved_report`. The scheduler runs the report, generating a `report_execution` and an M13 artefact, then delivers via EMAIL/IN_APP/SFTP under owner- or per-recipient-scope, with suppression applied. On-demand export shares the pipeline.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A schedule can be created with cron, format, recipients, channel; recipients are RBAC-validated.
  - AC2: A scheduled run produces a `report_execution` (COMPLETED/FAILED) and, on success, a stored M13 artefact.
  - AC3: Bursting by `org_unit` produces one file per unit, each filtered + suppressed to that unit and delivered to that unit's recipients.
  - AC4: Per-recipient-scope mode generates each recipient's copy under their own RLS scope (no over-disclosure).
  - AC5: PDF/XLSX/CSV supported; PDF header/footer carry scope, as-of, as-of-knowledge, page numbers.
  - AC6: A failed run retries per policy, alerts the owner on final failure, and is logged.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: An out-of-scope recipient is dropped (logged), never sent data beyond entitlement.
  - BR2: RESTRICTED reports cannot be scheduled to EMAIL unless encryption/secure-channel policy is satisfied; otherwise IN_APP only.
  - BR3: Exports retained per statutory retention; `report_execution` artefacts expire and purge on schedule; **DPDP erasure may set status REDACTED early (FR-20)**.
  - BR4: Schedule cron is stored UTC; displayed in owner timezone.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `report_schedule` | schedule definition |
| `report_execution` | run instances |
| `saved_report` | source definition |
| `documents` (M13) | generated artefact |

| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/executions/{id}` | execution status/artefact |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/schedules/{id}:pause` | pause/resume |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Schedule dialog (cron builder, format, recipients with scope warning, scope-mode toggle, burst toggle, channel); executions list with status, row count, download link, expiry; on-demand export menu with progress; failure surfaced with retry.
- **Edge Cases:** Recipient leaves org before run (dropped); burst over 500 values (throttled batch); CSV with embedded delimiters (RFC-4180 quoting); huge PDF (paginated/streamed, size cap warns); erased subject mid-retention (artefact REDACTED).
- **LLD:**

### FR-M14-10 — Drill-Down & Permission-Gated Drill-Through to Source Records

- **Module:** M14-F10
- **Primary Role(s):** Manager, HR Officer, Department Head, Auditor
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to drill down through aggregate charts and then drill through to the underlying source record when permitted, so that I can investigate an outlier — without leaving an audit gap.
- **Description:** **Drill-down** expands an aggregate along a `drilldown_path` within the analytics layer. **Drill-through** opens the authoritative record in the owning module via a route template, only if the user has both analytics scope and the owning module's permission. Every drill-through is logged (async, full fidelity). Drill-through is read-only. **v2:** small-cell suppression is enforced here *and* on the tiles/charts above it (FR-17), so the leaf is never reachable when the aggregate itself would re-identify.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A user can expand a chart along the configured drill path level by level, each RLS-scoped and suppressed.
  - AC2: Drill-through is offered only when authorised in both M14 (scope) and the owning module (permission); otherwise hidden/disabled.
  - AC3: Drill-through opens the owning module's read-only record view, not an M14 copy.
  - AC4: Every drill-through writes a full-fidelity `analytics_access_log` (DRILLTHROUGH) row with record id and sensitivity.
  - AC5: A drill-through to a record outside scope returns 403 `DRILLTHROUGH_FORBIDDEN`.
  - AC6: Aggregates below the privacy threshold suppress drill-through (k-anonymity + complementary suppression).
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: M14 never renders an editable source form.
  - BR2: Permission check is a live cross-module authorization call, not a cached flag.
  - BR3: Suppression threshold (default k=5) is configurable via `suppression_policy`.
  - BR4: Auditor drill-through is read-only and fully logged.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `dashboard_widget` (drilldown_path, drillthrough_target) | navigation config |
| `suppression_policy` | k-anonymity |
| `analytics_access_log` | drill-through audit |
| Owning-module records (ref) | deep-link target |
| `rls_scope_policy` | scope check |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/widgets/{id}/drilldown?level=&path=` | next drill level |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/widgets/{id}/drillthrough?rowKey=` | resolve deep link + authz |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/access-log` | view drill/export audit (authorised) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Click-to-expand with breadcrumb; "Open source record" visible only when permitted; opens owning module read-only; suppressed cells show "below privacy threshold"; access indicated as logged.
- **Edge Cases:** Record soft-deleted after aggregation ("record no longer available"); cross-module permission revoked mid-session (action disabled on next check); deep link to module under maintenance (graceful 503 passthrough).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `DrillController`, `DrilldownService`, `DrillthroughResolver`, `CrossModuleAuthzClient`, `SmallCellSuppressor` |
| Backend Flow | Drill-down → query next mart level (RLS, suppressed) → return; Drill-through → resolve route → live authz (M14 scope ∩ owning-module perm) → return deep link or 403 → async log |
| Data Operations | SELECT marts (RLS, suppressed); call owning-module authz; async INSERT access_log |
| Validation | Path validity; small-cell threshold; live permission |
| Authorization | M14 scope + owning-module permission (both) |
| State Changes & Side Effects | async access_log DRILLTHROUGH; no source mutation |
| Failure Handling | Out-of-scope → 403 `DRILLTHROUGH_FORBIDDEN`; suppressed → 403 `SMALL_CELL_SUPPRESSED`; source gone → 404 passthrough |
| Dependencies | FR-04 RLS; FR-17 suppression; owning modules M01–M13 authz |
| Test Guidance | Both-permission gate; k-anonymity + complementary suppression; read-only deep link; audit completeness |

### FR-M14-11 — Alerting, Thresholds & Effective-Dated KPI Targets

- **Module:** M14-F11
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Analytics Administrator
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want thresholds and targets on KPIs with alerts when they breach, evaluated against the threshold in force for the period, so that I am notified of attrition spikes, SLA backlogs, or vacancy surges proactively.
- **Description:** Attaches `alert_rule`s to governed KPIs (operator, threshold via `kpi_target_history` or static, scope, severity, frequency, recipients, suppression window, hysteresis). On each evaluation the engine compares the scoped value to the **effective-dated** threshold; a breach creates an `alert_event`, sends `notifications`, and badges dashboards. **v2:** thresholds are effective-dated; flapping is damped by `hysteresis_pct`.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A rule can be created on an ACTIVE KPI with operator, threshold, scope, severity, frequency, recipients.
  - AC2: When a scoped KPI value breaches the threshold in force for the period, an `alert_event` is created and recipients notified.
  - AC3: Repeat breaches within `suppression_window_min` (and within `hysteresis_pct`) do not generate duplicates.
  - AC4: A recipient can acknowledge an alert; status OPEN→ACKNOWLEDGED→RESOLVED.
  - AC5: Recipients are RBAC/scope validated; out-of-scope dropped.
  - AC6: Dashboards show active alert badges on affected KPI tiles.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Alerts evaluate against the same governed snapshot/value as dashboards; no separate calculation.
  - BR2: An alert on a stale/partial mart is flagged `data_as_of`/partial in the event and notification.
  - BR3: DELTA_PCT compares to the prior comparable period.
  - BR4: CRITICAL alerts cannot be globally muted by a non-admin; only acknowledged.
  - **BR5 (v2):** The threshold used is the `kpi_target_history` value covering the evaluated period.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `alert_rule` | rule config |
| `alert_event` | triggered events |
| `kpi_target_history` | effective-dated thresholds |
| `kpi_definition`/`kpi_snapshot` | evaluation source |
| `notifications` | delivery |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/alert-rules` | create rule |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/alert-events` | list events (scoped) |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/alert-events/{id}:acknowledge` | acknowledge |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/alert-rules/{id}:pause` | pause/resume |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Rule builder (KPI picker, operator, effective-dated threshold, scope, severity, recipients, suppression, hysteresis); alert inbox with severity chips, value vs threshold, as-of, acknowledge/resolve; KPI tiles show alert badges + target-vs-actual gauges (period-correct target).
- **Edge Cases:** KPI retired with active rules (auto-paused + steward notified); flapping near threshold (hysteresis + suppression); evaluation while mart FAILED (skipped, logged, no false alert); threshold changed mid-period (period-correct value applied).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `AlertRuleController`, `AlertEvaluator`, `SuppressionEngine`, `AlertNotifier`, `TargetHistoryService` |
| Backend Flow | On schedule/refresh → for each active rule resolve scoped KPI value → fetch effective-dated threshold → compare with hysteresis → if breach and not suppressed → create event → validate recipients → notify → badge dashboards |
| Data Operations | SELECT kpi_snapshot + kpi_target_history; INSERT alert_event; INSERT notifications; UPDATE event status |
| Validation | KPI active; operator/threshold validity; recipient scope; suppression/hysteresis |
| Authorization | HR/Dept Head/Admin create scoped; recipients validated |
| State Changes & Side Effects | event lifecycle; notifications; dashboard badges |
| Failure Handling | Stale mart → flagged partial; FAILED mart → skipped; bad recipient → dropped+logged |
| Dependencies | FR-02 KPI, FR-03 refresh hooks, E17 targets, notifications |
| Test Guidance | Breach detection; effective-dated threshold; suppression/hysteresis/no-dup; recipient scope; retired-KPI auto-pause |

### FR-M14-12 — Data Freshness, Role-Adaptive Language & Reconciliation Explainer

- **Module:** M14-F12
- **Primary Role(s):** All roles (consume), Data Engineer (operate)
- **User Story:** As any dashboard user, I want every number to tell me how fresh it is — in words I understand — and to explain why it might differ from the source system, so that I never decide on silently outdated or seemingly contradictory figures.
- **Description:** A cross-cutting capability: every surface carries `data_as_of` and a freshness state derived from mart `health_status` + SLA. **v2 (role-adaptive):** leaders/employees see plain language ("Numbers are a day behind — payroll still updating"); operators/auditors see technical states (STALE/DEGRADED/watermark). **v2 (reconciliation explainer):** a "why does this differ from the source?" panel shows `data_as_of`, the watermark, and any in-flight correction/knowledge-version — directly answering the §1.2 "headcount disagrees with payroll" pain.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Every widget/tile shows a `data_as_of` timestamp in the user's timezone.
  - AC2: A mart past its freshness SLA renders dependent surfaces with a STALE indicator and tooltip.
  - AC3: A DEGRADED/FAILED mart shows last good data with a prominent warning; new computations flagged `is_partial`.
  - AC4: Exports and scheduled reports embed freshness state and as-of in header/footer.
  - AC5: Alerts evaluated on stale data carry the staleness flag.
  - AC6: A global "data health" panel summarises mart freshness for operators.
  - **AC7 (v2):** Freshness copy renders in plain language for EMPLOYEE/MANAGER/DEPT_HEAD/EXECUTIVE and technical language for ANALYTICS_ADMIN/DATA_ENGINEER/AUDITOR.
  - **AC8 (v2):** A reconciliation explainer panel is available on every reconcilable KPI tile, showing as-of, watermark, last reconciliation variance, and any pending correction.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Freshness state is derived from mart health + SLA; not hand-set per widget.
  - BR2: No surface may display a value without an associated `data_as_of`.
  - BR3: FAILED-mart surfaces differentiate via colour + icon + text (WCAG, non-colour cue).
  - BR4: Degraded-mode behaviour is consistent across UI, exports, and API (`dataFreshness` block).
  - **BR5 (v2):** The same underlying state maps to two copy registers (plain/technical) keyed off role; the technical value remains available to leaders on demand.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `analytics_datamart` | health/SLA source |
| `datamart_refresh_log` | watermark + reconcile variance for explainer |
| `kpi_snapshot` (is_partial, data_as_of, knowledge_time) | freshness on values |
| `report_execution` (data_as_of) | freshness on exports |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/data-health` | mart freshness summary |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/kpis/{code}/reconciliation-explainer?scope=&period=` | as-of/watermark/variance/correction |
| (cross-cutting) | all analytics GETs return `dataFreshness` block | as-of + state (+ role-adaptive label) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Freshness chip on every tile (green/amber/red + icon + label); **role-adaptive tooltip copy**; reconciliation explainer panel; global data-health panel for operators; export header/footer freshness line; degraded banner.
- **Edge Cases:** Mixed-freshness dashboard (per-widget badges + worst-case global); clock skew (server-authoritative timestamps); mart never refreshed (NO_DATA, not "fresh"); leader requests technical detail (expandable).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `FreshnessService`, `DataHealthController`, `ReconciliationExplainerService`, response `FreshnessDecorator`, `RoleAdaptiveCopyResolver` |
| Backend Flow | On each response look up mart health/SLA → compute state → attach `dataFreshness` block + per-value `is_partial` + role-adaptive label; explainer joins refresh-log watermark + variance + pending corrections |
| Data Operations | SELECT mart health, refresh-log, snapshot watermarks; no writes |
| Validation | Presence of data_as_of on every value; state derivation; copy-register selection |
| Authorization | All roles see freshness; operators see global panel |
| State Changes & Side Effects | none (read-only decoration); influences alert flagging |
| Failure Handling | Health lookup failure → conservative DEGRADED (fail-safe to "not fresh") |
| Dependencies | FR-03 marts; consumed by FR-01/05/06/07/08/09/11/16 |
| Test Guidance | SLA-boundary state; degraded parity across UI/export/API; NO_DATA vs FRESH; WCAG non-colour cue; **role-adaptive copy; reconciliation explainer accuracy** |

### FR-M14-13 — Deterministic Retirement Forecasting (Phase 1, split from v1 FR-13)

- **Module:** M14-F13
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Executive
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want a deterministic retirement forecast — counts and named individuals retiring within configurable horizons — so that I can plan recruitment and succession ahead of retirement bulges, with near-zero model risk.
- **Description:** A **deterministic** forecaster computing retirement dates from canonical M01 DOB + cadre retirement rules. No probabilistic model, no fairness exposure — it ships in the foundation phase (council split, R6/Reviewer-3). Outputs counts by scope/horizon and, for permitted roles, drillable individual lists. Registered as a `prediction_model` with `determinism=DETERMINISTIC` for governance symmetry.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Retirement forecast lists subjects retiring within configurable horizons (1/3/5Y) by scope, deterministic from canonical rules.
  - AC2: Counts reconcile exactly to M01 DOB + cadre rules (zero tolerance).
  - AC3: Individual lists are RLS-scoped, suppressed below k, and audited.
  - AC4: The forecast carries `data_as_of` and is labelled "deterministic — based on date of birth and retirement rules".
  - AC5: A registered deterministic model requires methodology text but **no fairness assessment** (it uses no protected-correlated features).
  - AC6: Backdated DOB correction (FR-20) re-derives the forecast as a new knowledge-version (FR-23).
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Retirement age/date uses canonical M01/cadre rules; M14 does not invent retirement logic.
  - BR2: Deterministic outputs are not friction-gated at the aggregate level; individual lists follow standard RLS + suppression.
  - BR3: Deterministic models are exempt from the FR-18 adverse-impact gate but must still publish methodology.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `prediction_model` (determinism=DETERMINISTIC) | registry/methodology |
| `prediction_result` | retirement counts/dates per subject |
| Marts (workforce) + `employees` DOB (ref) | inputs |
| `analytics_access_log` | individual drill audit |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/models` | register deterministic model |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/predictions/retirement` | retirement forecast (scoped) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Retirement timeline + heatmap (age band × cadre); horizon selector; drillable to permitted individuals; "deterministic" label; freshness badge.
- **Edge Cases:** Missing/invalid DOB (excluded, flagged data-quality); cadre rule change (recompute, new knowledge-version); employee already separated (excluded).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ModelRegistryController`, `RetirementForecaster`, `SuppressionDecorator` |
| Backend Flow | Register (methodology) → on run compute retirement_date = DOB + cadre rule → bucket by horizon/scope → suppress small cells → persist results with data_as_of |
| Data Operations | INSERT prediction_model/result; SELECT DOB + cadre rules; no source writes |
| Validation | Methodology present; DOB validity; horizon validity |
| Authorization | HR/Dept Head/Exec scoped; individual lists RLS+suppressed |
| State Changes & Side Effects | model DRAFT→ACTIVE→RETIRED; result rows; async access_log on drill |
| Failure Handling | Missing DOB → excluded + data-quality flag; feature mart missing → 503 |
| Dependencies | FR-03 marts, FR-04 RLS, FR-17 suppression, FR-23 bitemporal, M01 retirement rules |
| Test Guidance | Deterministic retirement math; horizon boundaries; suppression; knowledge-version on DOB correction |

### FR-M14-14 — Benchmarking & Comparative Analytics (Effective-Dated Targets)

- **Module:** M14-F14
- **Primary Role(s):** Department Head, Executive, HR Officer
- **User Story:** As an Executive, I want to compare KPIs across periods, peer org units, and against the target in force for each period, so that I can see who is improving, who lags, and where to intervene — on a like-for-like basis.
- **Description:** Comparative views over governed KPIs: **period-over-period**, **peer comparison** (normalised), and **target-vs-actual** against the **effective-dated** `kpi_target_history` value for the period. RLS-scoped; suppression-applied. **v2:** RAG status uses the period-correct target, fixing wrong historical target-vs-actual (R13).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A KPI can be compared across selectable periods with variance and % change.
  - AC2: Peer comparison ranks sibling org units on a normalised (rate/per-capita) basis within scope.
  - AC3: Target-vs-actual shows attainment % and RAG status based on `direction` and the **target in force for that period**.
  - AC4: Comparisons exclude units outside RLS scope and suppress small denominators.
  - AC5: Outliers (top/bottom N or beyond N std dev) are highlighted with the basis explained.
  - AC6: External benchmark series, when configured, are shown as a clearly-labelled external reference line.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Comparisons use governed KPI snapshots only.
  - BR2: Size-sensitive metrics are normalised before ranking.
  - BR3: A user cannot benchmark against a peer unit outside scope.
  - BR4: External benchmarks are reference-only and visually distinguished.
  - **BR5 (v2):** RAG and attainment use the effective-dated target for the shown period, never today's target for a past period.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `kpi_snapshot` | comparison series (version-stamped) |
| `kpi_target_history` | period-correct target |
| `kpi_definition` (direction) | RAG basis |
| `analytics_datamart` | denominators for normalisation |
| `rls_scope_policy` | peer scope |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/benchmark/period?kpi=&periods=` | period-over-period |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/benchmark/peers?kpi=&scope=` | peer ranking |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/benchmark/target?kpi=&scope=&period=` | target-vs-actual (effective-dated) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Comparison panel with period selector, normalised peer ranking, variance arrows, RAG gauges (period-correct target), outlier highlights, optional external reference line with legend; tooltips explain normalisation and which target applies.
- **Edge Cases:** Peer with zero denominator (excluded + note); newly created unit lacking history ("insufficient history"); target unset for period (target view hidden, not zero); version change in series (marker shown, FR-02).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `BenchmarkController`, `PeriodComparator`, `PeerRanker`, `TargetAttainmentService` (effective-dated), `NormalizationService` |
| Backend Flow | Resolve scope + peers → pull governed snapshots → normalise → fetch period-correct target → compute variance/rank/attainment/RAG → flag outliers → suppress → assemble |
| Data Operations | SELECT kpi_snapshot + kpi_target_history + denominators (RLS); no writes |
| Validation | Peer scope membership; denominator presence; target presence for period |
| Authorization | Dept Head/Exec/HR scoped |
| State Changes & Side Effects | none (read-only); async access_log on view |
| Failure Handling | Missing denominator → excluded + note; no target → target view hidden; no history → insufficient-history state |
| Dependencies | FR-02 snapshots, E17 targets, FR-04 RLS, FR-17 suppression |
| Test Guidance | Normalisation; peer-scope exclusion; **effective-dated RAG**; outlier basis |

### FR-M14-15 — Natural-Language Query (Confidence-Gated) & Hardened Embedded BI

- **Module:** M14-F15
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Executive; Analytics Administrator (embed config)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to ask questions in plain language and embed governed widgets in other portals, so that analytics are accessible and reusable — always within my permissions, never producing confidently-wrong numbers, and never leaking a credential.
- **Description:** **NL query**: maps a question to the governed semantic model, generates a parameterised RLS-scoped query, and returns a result plus the resolved interpretation. **v2:** enforces a confidence threshold — below it, it clarifies or refuses rather than answering; logs every interpretation to `nl_query_log`; uses a **named on-prem LLM** (default **Llama-3.x-class model self-hosted at CGG Data Centre** — no HR prompt/data leaves the data centre; DPDP-assessed). **Embedded BI**: **v2 hardened** — tokens are issued maker-checker, never travel in a URL path (header or short-lived code-exchange), carry CSP `frame-ancestors`, are revocable/rotatable, and re-validate scope per render.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An NL question resolves to a governed KPI/dimension/filter set and returns a scoped result with the interpretation shown.
  - AC2: An ambiguous question prompts clarification; an out-of-scope question is refused with explanation; **a below-threshold-confidence question is refused (`NLQ_CONFIDENCE_TOO_LOW`) not answered**.
  - AC3: NL never generates raw free-form SQL; it only parameterises the governed semantic model.
  - AC4: An embed token is scoped to specific widgets, a user/role, and an expiry; it enforces the same RLS; **issuance is maker-checker (≠ issuer)**.
  - AC5: Every NL query (with confidence + outcome) and embedded render writes audit (`nl_query_log` / async access_log).
  - AC6: NL results carry the same freshness, suppression, and sensitivity handling as native widgets.
  - **AC7 (v2):** The embed credential is never accepted from the URL; a revoked token returns 401 `EMBED_TOKEN_REVOKED`; CSP `frame-ancestors` restricts embedding origins.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: NL is constrained to the semantic layer + governed KPIs; it cannot fabricate metrics.
  - BR2: Embed tokens are scoped, signed, expiring, **revocable, rotatable**; not API bypass keys.
  - BR3: NL interpretation is always shown; **interpretation + confidence are logged for misinterpretation audit**.
  - BR4: RESTRICTED metrics require the same authority via NL/embed as in-app.
  - **BR5 (v2):** The LLM provider and hosting location are named and on-prem; prompts/data do not leave the CGG Data Centre.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `kpi_definition`/`analytics_datamart` (semantic) | NL target space |
| `nl_query_log` | NL interpretation/confidence/outcome audit |
| `embed_token` | hardened embed credential |
| `dashboard_widget` | embeddable units |
| `rls_scope_policy` | scope on NL/embed |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

### FR-M14-16 — Mobile Dashboards, Executive Briefing Pack & Offline RESTRICTED-Data Policy

- **Module:** M14-F16
- **Primary Role(s):** Executive, Department Head, Manager
- **User Story:** As an Executive, I want responsive mobile dashboards and a periodic briefing pack, so that I can monitor the workforce from my phone — without RESTRICTED PII ever resting unprotected on the device.
- **Description:** Mobile-optimised renderings of role dashboards plus a scheduled executive briefing pack (PDF/in-app digest) generated under the recipient's RLS. **v2 (offline policy):** the on-device cache is encrypted, **excludes RESTRICTED fields/PII from offline caching**, enforces cache expiry, and supports remote-wipe; offline shows last-loaded non-restricted view with an explicit stale badge.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Role dashboards render legibly on mobile breakpoints with touch drill-down and an alert inbox.
  - AC2: An executive briefing pack can be scheduled and delivered as a scope-correct PDF + in-app digest.
  - AC3: The briefing includes top KPIs, key trends, open critical alerts, compliance highlights for the recipient's scope.
  - AC4: Briefing figures carry `data_as_of` and freshness state.
  - AC5: Mobile views enforce the same RLS, suppression, and sensitivity masking as desktop.
  - AC6: Briefing generation reuses the schedule/export pipeline (FR-09) and is audited.
  - **AC7 (v2):** The on-device cache is encrypted and **excludes RESTRICTED fields**; cache expires per policy; remote-wipe invalidates it; offline never reveals RESTRICTED PII.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Mobile is the same governed data and RLS — no relaxed scoping.
  - BR2: The briefing pack is generated per recipient under their scope.
  - BR3: Briefing content is configurable per role but limited to governed KPIs/compliance metrics.
  - BR4: Critical alerts always appear regardless of trimming.
  - **BR5 (v2):** RESTRICTED fields/PII are never written to the offline cache; only PUBLIC/INTERNAL aggregates may be cached, encrypted, with expiry.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `dashboard`/`dashboard_widget` | mobile render source |
| `report_schedule`/`report_execution` | briefing delivery |
| `kpi_snapshot`/`alert_event` | briefing content |
| `documents` (M13) | briefing PDF artefact |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/briefings/schedules` | schedule briefing |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/briefings/{executionId}` | briefing artefact |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Mobile layout (stacked KPI cards, swipeable sparklines, collapsible sections, bottom-nav, alert badge); briefing digest with sections each carrying as-of + "open full dashboard"; PDF mirrors the digest; offline shows non-restricted cached view + stale badge; settings expose remote-wipe.
- **Edge Cases:** Offline/poor connectivity (last-loaded non-restricted cached view + explicit stale badge, no silent refresh); very small screen (progressive disclosure); recipient scope emptied (digest notes "no data in scope"); lost device (remote-wipe clears encrypted cache).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `MobileRenderer`, `BriefingComposer`, reuse `ReportScheduler`/`ExportRenderer`, `FreshnessDecorator`, `OfflineCacheGuard` |
| Backend Flow | Mobile render → same pipeline with viewport hint, RESTRICTED stripped from cacheable payload; Briefing → scheduled per recipient → resolve scope → compose top KPIs/alerts/compliance → render PDF + in-app → deliver → log |
| Data Operations | SELECT marts/snapshots/alerts (RLS, suppressed); INSERT report_execution; create document ref |
| Validation | Viewport handling; recipient scope; governed-content only; **offline-cacheability (no RESTRICTED)** |
| Authorization | Same RBAC+RLS as desktop; per-recipient briefing scope |
| State Changes & Side Effects | execution + document + async access_log; notification delivery |
| Failure Handling | Offline → non-restricted cached + stale badge; empty scope → "no data" digest; render fail → retry+alert (FR-09) |
| Dependencies | FR-01 dashboards, FR-09 export, FR-11 alerts, FR-12 freshness, FR-17 suppression |
| Test Guidance | RLS parity mobile vs desktop; per-recipient briefing scope; critical-alert inclusion; **offline excludes RESTRICTED; encrypted cache; remote-wipe** |

### FR-M14-17 — Metric-Level Privacy & Complementary Suppression (NEW — R1, Critical)

- **Module:** M14-F17
- **Primary Role(s):** Analytics Administrator (configure), All roles (enforced)
- **User Story:** As an Analytics Administrator, I want suppression applied to KPI tiles, charts, and exports — not just drill-through — with complementary suppression across overlapping scopes/periods, so that no individual is re-identified by aggregate arithmetic even when row-level security is airtight.
- **Description:** A cross-cutting privacy layer governed by `suppression_policy` (E24). For every aggregate read, any cell whose group size/denominator `< k` is suppressed or banded; the engine additionally applies **complementary suppression** — when one cell in a row/column is suppressed, enough complementary cells are suppressed so the hidden value cannot be recovered by subtracting visible totals, including across this-period-vs-last-period and with-vs-without-one-unit differencing. This closes the council's most dangerous finding: RLS stops record leakage; FR-17 stops metric re-identification.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A tile/chart cell with denominator/group size `< k` (default 5, per-KPI override `min_cell_size`) is suppressed or banded ("<5").
  - AC2: When a cell is suppressed, complementary cells are suppressed so the value cannot be recovered from a visible total.
  - AC3: Differencing two overlapping scopes or periods cannot reconstruct a suppressed cell (verified by the suppression test harness).
  - AC4: Suppression applies uniformly to tiles, charts, exports, and drill-through.
  - AC5: A suppressed aggregate read returns/annotates `SMALL_CELL_SUPPRESSED`; partially suppressed results carry `COMPLEMENTARY_SUPPRESSION_APPLIED` notice.
  - AC6: The suppression scope-leak/aggregate-re-identification test matrix is a launch gate (§13.4).
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Suppression is applied **after** RLS and masking, on the final aggregate, server-side; clients never receive the suppressed values.
  - BR2: `k` and banding are configurable per `suppression_policy` and per KPI; the stricter of the two applies.
  - BR3: Suppression is never disabled for RESTRICTED domains; an admin cannot lower `k` below the statutory minimum.
  - BR4: Suppression decisions are deterministic for a given `(query, k, data)` so trends remain stable.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `suppression_policy` | k + complementary config |
| `kpi_snapshot` (cell_size) | group-size source |
| `kpi_definition` (min_cell_size) | per-KPI override |
| `analytics_access_log` | suppressed-access audit |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/suppression-policies` | create/update policy |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/suppression-policies` | list policies |
| (cross-cutting) | applied within every aggregate read | tiles/charts/exports/drill |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Suppressed cells render "<5" or "below privacy threshold" with a tooltip; admin policy editor with k, banding, complementary toggle, domain scope; a suppression-simulation preview shows which cells would hide for a sample query.
- **Edge Cases:** Single non-suppressed cell left in a row whose total is visible (complementary suppression hides a second cell); time-series where one period drops below k (that point banded + adjacent complement considered); export of a fully-small dataset (whole grid banded with a header note).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SuppressionPolicyController`, `SmallCellSuppressor`, `ComplementarySuppressionEngine`, `SuppressionDecorator` |
| Backend Flow | Compute aggregate (post-RLS) → evaluate each cell's group size → suppress/band below k → run complementary pass across row/column/period overlaps → annotate result → enqueue audit |
| Data Operations | Read cell_size from snapshot/aggregate; no writes to source |
| Validation | k ≥ statutory minimum; deterministic suppression; complementary completeness |
| Authorization | Admin configure; all enforced |
| State Changes & Side Effects | none (read-only decoration); audit annotation |
| Failure Handling | Below threshold → `SMALL_CELL_SUPPRESSED`; partial → `COMPLEMENTARY_SUPPRESSION_APPLIED` |
| Dependencies | FR-04 RLS (applied first); consumed by FR-01/05/06/07/08/09/10/14/16 |
| Test Guidance | **Aggregate re-identification harness (differencing attacks)**; complementary completeness; determinism/trend stability; export parity |

### FR-M14-18 — Probabilistic Predictive Analytics with Fairness Governance & Friction-Gated Scores (NEW — R4, Critical)

- **Module:** M14-F18
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, Department Head, Executive; Analytics Administrator (model governance); DPO (fairness sign-off)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want explainable attrition and succession risk that is fairness-audited, excludes protected/correlated attributes, and gates individual scores behind a deliberate, purpose-stated action, so that I can target retention and succession without enabling discriminatory or constitutionally-impermissible decisions.
- **Description:** Registers **probabilistic** `prediction_model`s (attrition, succession) over governed marts. **Before activation** a model must publish a model card, declare a `protected_features_excluded` list (caste/reservation category, gender, disability, maternity-linked leave proxies), pass documented **adverse-impact/disparate-impact testing** (`fairness_status=PASSED` or `WAIVED_WITH_REASON` by the DPO), and carry an `intended_use` and a `prohibited_use` ("must not be the sole or primary basis for any administrative action"). Aggregate/banded risk distributions are freely viewable to authorised scope; **individual scores are friction-gated** — opening a named individual's score requires a deliberate action, a purpose prompt, RESTRICTED authority, and a full-fidelity audit entry.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A probabilistic model cannot be activated without a published model card, a `protected_features_excluded` list, and `fairness_status ∈ {PASSED, WAIVED_WITH_REASON}`; otherwise 422 `MODEL_FAIRNESS_ASSESSMENT_REQUIRED`.
  - AC2: Activation requires `approved_by ≠ created_by`; DPO co-signs the fairness assessment.
  - AC3: Aggregate/banded risk distributions are viewable to authorised scope (suppressed below k).
  - AC4: Opening an **individual** score requires a deliberate "view individual prediction" action with a purpose prompt; it is RESTRICTED, friction-gated, and audited (`VIEW_INDIVIDUAL_PREDICTION`).
  - AC5: An attempt to surface an individual score on hover/tile, or by an unauthorised role, returns 403 `PREDICTION_INDIVIDUAL_GATED`.
  - AC6: Every predictive figure is labelled advisory with model id, version, confidence, `data_as_of`, and the prohibited-use clause; new joiners with insufficient history return `NO_PREDICTION`, not a false HIGH.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Predictions are advisory; never written to M01–M13; never the sole/primary basis for any administrative action.
  - BR2: Protected/correlated attributes are excluded from features; the exclusion list is part of the model card and is audited.
  - BR3: Adverse-impact testing thresholds are documented; a FAILED model cannot activate; a WAIVED model records the DPO reason.
  - BR4: Individual scores are RESTRICTED and friction-gated; aggregate distributions follow standard RLS + suppression.
  - BR5: Data drift flags a model for re-review; a drifted model's results are frozen read-only until re-assessed.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `prediction_model` (fairness fields, model_card_ref) | governed registry |
| `prediction_result` (is_individual_gated) | scores per subject |
| `documents` (M13) | model card artefact |
| Marts (workforce/leave/appraisal/transfer) | features (protected excluded) |
| `analytics_access_log` (VIEW_INDIVIDUAL_PREDICTION) | friction-gated audit |

| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/predictions/succession?scope=` | succession risk distribution |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/predictions/individual` | friction-gated individual score (purpose required) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Predictive dashboard with risk-band distribution and succession heatmap (role criticality × bench risk); prominent "Advisory — not an administrative decision; must not be the sole/primary basis for action" banner; model-card link; individual score behind an explicit "View individual prediction" action with a mandatory purpose field and a friction confirmation; never on hover.
- **Edge Cases:** Insufficient history (NO_PREDICTION); model retired/drifted (results frozen); fairness test FAILED (activation blocked); WAIVED (DPO reason recorded + shown to Auditor); attempt to slice by a protected attribute (rejected).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ModelRegistryController`, `FairnessAssessor`, `AttritionScorer`, `SuccessionAnalyzer`, `ExplainabilityService`, `IndividualScoreGate` |
| Backend Flow | Register (card + exclusions) → assess fairness (adverse-impact) → activate (checker + DPO) → on run assemble features (protected excluded) from marts (RLS) → score → derive band + top factors + confidence → persist; aggregate views suppressed; individual view friction-gated + audited |
| Data Operations | INSERT prediction_model/result; create model-card doc; SELECT feature marts; full-fidelity access_log on individual view |
| Validation | Model card present; exclusions present; fairness PASSED/WAIVED; methodology present; confidence; advisory labelling |
| Authorization | HR/Dept Head/Exec aggregate scoped; individual RESTRICTED + friction-gated; DPO fairness co-sign |
| State Changes & Side Effects | model DRAFT→ACTIVE→RETIRED; fairness_status; result rows; access_log VIEW_INDIVIDUAL_PREDICTION |
| Failure Handling | No fairness → 422 `MODEL_FAIRNESS_ASSESSMENT_REQUIRED`; individual ungated access → 403 `PREDICTION_INDIVIDUAL_GATED`; insufficient data → NO_PREDICTION; black-box → publish blocked `MODEL_METHODOLOGY_REQUIRED` |
| Dependencies | FR-03 marts, FR-04 RLS, FR-17 suppression, FR-13 (deterministic counterpart), DPO governance |
| Test Guidance | **Adverse-impact gate; protected-attribute exclusion; friction-gate on individual scores; prohibited-use labelling; NO_PREDICTION for new joiners; drift freeze** |

### FR-M14-19 — Establishment & Position-Management Reference Integration (NEW — R8, High)

- **Module:** M14-F19
- **Primary Role(s):** Establishment Officer (maintain), HR Officer/Dept Head/Executive/Auditor (consume)
- **User Story:** As an Establishment Officer, I want a position/establishment master — sanctioned strength, posts, reservation categories, and roster points — so that vacancy and reservation compliance have an authoritative denominator that no person-centric module (M01–M13) currently owns.
- **Description:** Names and hosts the establishment source of record as `establishment_position` (E21), exposed through `MART_ESTABLISHMENT`. It is the authoritative denominator for vacancy (FR-05) and reservation compliance (FR-07). The Establishment Officer authors sanctioned strength and roster points; M14 reports compliance and never approves posts. Filled = active employees mapped to sanctioned posts.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An Establishment Officer can create/maintain positions with sanctioned strength, cadre, designation, org unit, reservation category, and roster point, with effective dates.
  - AC2: `MART_ESTABLISHMENT` exposes positions for vacancy/reservation denominators.
  - AC3: Vacancy = sanctioned (establishment) − filled; reservation compliance = filled-by-category / sanctioned-for-category vs roster points.
  - AC4: Missing establishment data for a scope raises `ESTABLISHMENT_REFERENCE_MISSING` (notice), never a silent zero.
  - AC5: Position changes are effective-dated; historical vacancy reproduces against the establishment in force (FR-23).
  - AC6: Establishment edits are audited; M14 does not adjudicate roster decisions.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: M14 hosts the establishment reference; the Establishment Officer is the data custodian.
  - BR2: Sanctioned strength and roster points are authored here, not invented by analytics.
  - BR3: Vacancy/reservation denominators are pinned to this reference and to the effective-dated position record.
  - BR4: A position with status ABOLISHED is excluded from current sanctioned strength but retained for history.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `establishment_position` (E21) | sanctioned strength/roster points |
| `analytics_datamart` (MART_ESTABLISHMENT) | denominator mart |
| `org_units`,`designations`,`cadres` (ref) | dimensions |
| `employees` (ref) | filled mapping |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/establishment/positions` | create/maintain position |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/establishment/positions?scope=` | list positions (scoped) |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/establishment/vacancy-base?scope=&period=` | sanctioned-strength denominator |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Establishment console (position list with sanctioned strength, category, roster point, effective dates, status); create/edit form; data-quality flags for unmapped posts; read views for consumers.
- **Edge Cases:** Post sanctioned but not yet filled (counts as vacant); post abolished mid-year (excluded from current, retained historically); roster point conflict (flagged for Establishment Officer, not auto-resolved).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `EstablishmentController`, `PositionService`, `EstablishmentMartBuilder` |
| Backend Flow | Maintain positions (effective-dated) → build MART_ESTABLISHMENT → join to headcount for vacancy/reservation → expose denominator API |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE establishment_position; build mart; SELECT (RLS) |
| Validation | Sanctioned strength ≥ 0; effective-date integrity; roster-point uniqueness per category/unit |
| Authorization | Establishment Officer maintain; consumers read scoped |
| State Changes & Side Effects | position lifecycle SANCTIONED/FROZEN/ABOLISHED; mart refresh; audit |
| Failure Handling | Missing reference → `ESTABLISHMENT_REFERENCE_MISSING`; roster conflict → data-quality flag |
| Dependencies | FR-05 vacancy, FR-07 reservation, FR-03 mart, FR-23 effective-dated history |
| Test Guidance | Sanctioned-vs-filled math; effective-dated denominator; abolished exclusion; missing-reference notice |

### FR-M14-20 — DPDP Rectification & Erasure Propagation (NEW — R9, Critical)

- **Module:** M14-F20
- **Primary Role(s):** Data Protection Officer (govern/approve), Data Engineer (execute), Auditor (verify)
- **User Story:** As a Data Protection Officer, I want a correction or erasure of an employee's PII in M01 to propagate across the entire analytics estate — marts, snapshots, predictions, and export artefacts — reconciled against statutory retention, so that the analytics layer is not an uncontrolled second copy of unlawful or stale personal data.
- **Description:** A propagation pipeline driven by `data_subject_change` (E22). On a rectification/erasure/restriction event from M01 or a DPDP data-principal request, M14 runs impact analysis (which marts/snapshots/predictions/exports contain the subject), then **rectifies** (re-derives affected snapshots as new knowledge-versions, FR-23), **erases/purges** (`prediction_result` rows; marks `report_execution` artefacts `REDACTED` in M13), and **reconciles against statutory retention**: where retention legally overrides erasure (e.g., pension records), the change is `BLOCKED_RETENTION` with a recorded `legal_basis`, surfaced to the DPO and Auditor.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A `data_subject_change` (RECTIFICATION/ERASURE/RESTRICTION) triggers impact analysis identifying all affected derived rows/artefacts.
  - AC2: Rectification re-derives affected `kpi_snapshot`s as new knowledge-versions; prior rows are marked superseded, not mutated (FR-23).
  - AC3: Erasure purges `prediction_result` rows and marks affected `report_execution` artefacts `REDACTED` in M13.
  - AC4: Where statutory retention overrides erasure, the change is `BLOCKED_RETENTION` with a recorded `legal_basis`, and the data is restricted from analytics rendering rather than deleted.
  - AC5: Propagation completes within the configured SLA; incomplete propagation returns/notes `ERASURE_PROPAGATION_PENDING` on affected surfaces.
  - AC6: The DPO and Auditor can verify propagation completeness; every change is append-only audited.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Append-only ledgers are reconciled with erasure by **restriction/redaction + knowledge-versioning**, not by deleting historical audit rows (preserves audit integrity while honouring DPDP).
  - BR2: A retention override must record a legal basis and is reviewable by the Auditor.
  - BR3: Erased/restricted subjects are excluded from all new analytics computations and renders.
  - BR4: Propagation is idempotent and resumable; a failed step retries and alerts.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `data_subject_change` (E22) | request + propagation state |
| `kpi_snapshot` | bitemporal restatement target |
| `prediction_result` | purge target |
| `report_execution`/`documents` (M13) | REDACTED artefacts |
| `analytics_datamart` | rectified source rows |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/data-subject-changes` | register rectification/erasure (DPO/M01) |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/data-subject-changes/{id}` | propagation status |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/data-subject-changes/{id}:retention-override` | record legal basis (DPO) |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** DPO console listing changes with type, status, affected counts, SLA; impact-analysis preview; retention-override form with mandatory legal basis; Auditor verification view; affected surfaces show "data updated/erased per data-protection request".
- **Edge Cases:** Subject present in an exported PDF in M13 (artefact marked REDACTED, regenerated where lawful); erasure on a pension-retained record (BLOCKED_RETENTION + basis); concurrent rectification + report run (run waits or re-runs on the new knowledge-version).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `DataSubjectChangeController`, `ImpactAnalyzer`, `RectificationPropagator`, `ErasurePurger`, `RetentionReconciler` |
| Backend Flow | Receive change → impact analysis → rectify (re-derive snapshots as knowledge-versions) / purge predictions / mark exports REDACTED → reconcile retention → update status → audit → notify DPO/Auditor |
| Data Operations | INSERT data_subject_change; INSERT new snapshot knowledge-versions; DELETE prediction_result; UPDATE report_execution REDACTED; UPDATE mart rows (rectification) |
| Validation | Subject existence; retention rule lookup; idempotency; completeness |
| Authorization | DPO govern/override; Data Engineer execute; Auditor verify |
| State Changes & Side Effects | change RECEIVED→PROPAGATING→COMPLETED/BLOCKED_RETENTION/FAILED; snapshots superseded; artefacts REDACTED |
| Failure Handling | Step failure → retry + alert; incomplete → `ERASURE_PROPAGATION_PENDING`; retention block → `RETENTION_OVERRIDE_BLOCKS_ERASURE` (200 notice + basis) |
| Dependencies | M01 PII events, M13 artefacts, FR-23 bitemporal, FR-13/18 predictions |

### FR-M14-21 — Source Data Contracts & Schema-Drift Protection (NEW — R11, High)

- **Module:** M14-F21
- **Primary Role(s):** Data Engineer (own/maintain), owning-module steward (co-sign)
- **User Story:** As a Data Engineer, I want a versioned data contract between each source module and its marts, with CI contract tests and breaking-change alerts, so that upstream schema drift fails loudly in CI rather than silently breaking mart ETL in production.
- **Description:** Introduces `source_data_contract` (E19): a versioned source-view contract per mart that pins the columns, types, nullability, and semantics each source module (M01–M13) promises, plus the CDC mechanism (**Debezium** by default). Contract tests run in CI against each source; a breaking change fails CI and alerts both teams. A mart whose contract is `BREACHED` is held from refresh (FR-03 BR5).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each mart references a `source_data_contract` pinning the promised schema and CDC mechanism.
  - AC2: CI runs contract tests against each source view; a schema mismatch fails the build with the offending field.
  - AC3: A breaking upstream change marks the contract `BREACHED`, holds the mart from refresh, and alerts the Data Engineer + owning-module steward.
  - AC4: A contract is versioned; a new source-view version requires a co-signed contract update.
  - AC5: The CDC mechanism is named (Debezium) and recorded per contract.
  - AC6: Contract status and last test timestamp are visible in the Data Engineer console.
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: M14 reads sources only through contracted views, never raw tables.
  - BR2: A breaking change follows the contract's notice period before the old version is deprecated.
  - BR3: Contract tests are a CI gate; a BREACHED contract blocks production refresh of dependent marts.
  - BR4: The owning-module steward co-signs the schema promise.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `source_data_contract` (E19) | versioned schema promise |
| `analytics_datamart` | governed mart |
| `datamart_refresh_log` | refresh hold on breach |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/source-contracts` | register/version a contract |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/source-contracts/{id}:test` | run contract test |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/source-contracts?module=` | list contracts/status |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Contract registry (module, source view, version, CDC, status, last test); failing-field detail on breach; co-sign workflow; alert links.
- **Edge Cases:** Additive non-breaking change (contract minor-versioned, no hold); breaking change without notice (contract BREACHED, mart held, alert); source view renamed (contract update required before refresh).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `SourceContractController`, `ContractTestRunner`, `SchemaDiffer`, `BreachAlerter` |
| Backend Flow | Register contract → CI/manual test compares live source view to `schema_json` → on mismatch mark BREACHED + hold dependent marts + alert; on co-signed new version activate |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE source_data_contract; read source view metadata; update mart hold state |
| Validation | Schema diff; CDC mechanism; co-sign; version monotonicity |
| Authorization | Data Engineer own; owning-module steward co-sign |
| State Changes & Side Effects | contract DRAFT→ACTIVE→DEPRECATED/BREACHED; mart refresh hold; alerts |
| Failure Handling | Mismatch → `SOURCE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION` (CI fail / runtime hold) + alert |
| Dependencies | FR-03 marts; CI pipeline; source modules M01–M13 |
| Test Guidance | Breaking-change detection; additive-change tolerance; mart hold on breach; co-sign enforcement |

### FR-M14-22 — Access-Anomaly Detection (NEW — world-class addition)

- **Module:** M14-F22
- **Primary Role(s):** Auditor, Analytics Administrator (review)
- **User Story:** As an Auditor, I want proactive detection of anomalous analytics access — out-of-hours bulk exports, scope-edge probing, unusual drill-through volume — so that the audit ledger becomes preventive, not merely forensic.
- **Description:** A detection layer over the async-partitioned `analytics_access_log` (E16). It computes per-user/role baselines and flags deviations as `access_anomaly` (E23): off-hours bulk export, scope-edge probing (repeated near-boundary denied requests), unusual drill-through volume, repeated denials, mass NL queries. Anomalies raise notifications to Auditor/Analytics Admin and feed a review queue.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: The engine evaluates the access ledger on a schedule and flags anomalies against per-user/role baselines.
  - AC2: Off-hours bulk export above a threshold raises an `access_anomaly` (WARNING/CRITICAL).
  - AC3: Repeated denied/edge-probing requests raise a `SCOPE_EDGE_PROBING` anomaly.
  - AC4: Anomalies notify Auditor/Analytics Admin and appear in a review queue with evidence.
  - AC5: A reviewer can mark an anomaly INVESTIGATING/DISMISSED/CONFIRMED; the decision is audited.
  - AC6: Detection reads the append-only ledger only; it never blocks legitimate access (advisory + review, not enforcement).
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Detection operates on the partitioned async ledger off the read path (no added read latency).
  - BR2: Thresholds/baselines are configurable; CRITICAL anomalies always notify the Auditor.
  - BR3: Anomaly review decisions are append-only audited.
  - BR4: Detection is advisory; it informs investigation, it does not auto-revoke access.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `access_anomaly` (E23) | detected anomalies |
| `analytics_access_log` (E16) | source signal |
| `notifications` | alerting |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/anomalies?status=` | list anomalies (scoped) |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/anomalies/{id}:review` | mark INVESTIGATING/DISMISSED/CONFIRMED |
| POST | `/api/v1/analytics/anomaly-rules` | configure thresholds/baselines |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Anomaly queue with type, severity, evidence (counts, times), user/role; review actions; trend of anomalies; configuration for thresholds.
- **Edge Cases:** Legitimate quarter-end bulk export (reviewer dismisses with note); new user with no baseline (cold-start uses role baseline); detection job lag (queue notes evaluation as-of).

### FR-M14-23 — Bitemporal Snapshot & As-Of-Knowledge Reproducibility (NEW — R3, Critical)

- **Module:** M14-F23
- **Primary Role(s):** Auditor, Analytics Administrator, Data Engineer
- **User Story:** As an Auditor, I want every snapshot to record both the period it describes (valid-time) and when it became known (knowledge-time), and to pull "the June report as it was known in June", so that a backdated correction creates a reconciling lineage instead of two contradictory numbers.
- **Description:** Establishes the bitemporal contract for `kpi_snapshot` (E04): `valid_time` (business period described) + `knowledge_time` (when the value became known). A restatement (backdated leave approval, payroll correction, DPDP rectification) **adds a new knowledge-version** and marks the prior `is_superseded=true` with `superseded_by`; it never mutates history. Every report/KPI read accepts an **`asOfKnowledge`** parameter that returns the value whose `knowledge_time` is the latest ≤ the requested instant — reproducing exactly what was shown historically. This resolves the v1 append-only-vs-restatement contradiction (DI rule 6/12).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Every `kpi_snapshot` carries `valid_time` and `knowledge_time`.
  - AC2: A restatement adds a new knowledge-version; the prior row is retained, marked `is_superseded=true`, and linked via `superseded_by`.
  - AC3: A KPI/report read with `asOfKnowledge=T` returns the value known as of T (latest `knowledge_time ≤ T`).
  - AC4: The current (default) read returns the latest knowledge-version.
  - AC5: An auditor pulling the same period at two different knowledge instants gets the two reconciling values with lineage, never an unexplained discrepancy.
  - AC6: Append-only is preserved — no historical row is mutated or deleted (rectification adds rows; erasure restricts/redacts per FR-20).
- **Business Rules:**
  - BR1: Snapshots are append-only; correctness across time is achieved by knowledge-versioning, not mutation.
  - BR2: `asOfKnowledge` is honoured uniformly across KPI value, trend, report run, and compliance export.
  - BR3: A backfill/retroactive correction always produces a new knowledge-version, recompute job logged.
  - BR4: Reproducibility is deterministic for `(kpi_id, kpi_version, scope, period_key, knowledge_time)`.
- **Data Model References:**

| Entity | Use |
|---|---|
| `kpi_snapshot` (valid_time, knowledge_time, is_superseded, superseded_by) | bitemporal store |
| `datamart_refresh_log` | backfill/recompute provenance |
| `report_execution` (as_of_knowledge) | reproducible runs |

- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/kpis/{code}/value?...&asOfKnowledge=` | value as known at instant |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/kpis/{code}/history?scope=&period=` | knowledge-version lineage for a period |
| GET | `/api/v1/analytics/reports/{id}/run?asOfKnowledge=` | reproducible report run |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Optional "as of knowledge date" control on reports/KPIs; a period's value shows a "restated" badge with a lineage popover (original vs current knowledge-versions and why); audit export stamps both valid-time and knowledge-time.
- **Edge Cases:** Multiple restatements of one period (full lineage chain); `asOfKnowledge` before the first knowledge-version (NO_DATA / `AS_OF_KNOWLEDGE_UNAVAILABLE`); restatement caused by DPDP rectification (FR-20) links to the change record.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `BitemporalSnapshotStore`, `AsOfKnowledgeResolver`, `RestatementService`, `SnapshotMaterializer` |
| Backend Flow | Materialise snapshot with valid_time + knowledge_time → on restatement insert new knowledge-version, mark prior superseded → reads resolve latest knowledge_time ≤ requested (default = now) |
| Data Operations | INSERT snapshot knowledge-versions; UPDATE prior is_superseded/superseded_by (status flags only, value immutable); SELECT by knowledge_time |
| Validation | knowledge_time monotonicity per (kpi,version,scope,period); determinism |
| Authorization | All scoped reads honour asOfKnowledge; Auditor lineage view |
| State Changes & Side Effects | append knowledge-versions; supersede flags; recompute provenance |
| Failure Handling | asOfKnowledge before first version → `AS_OF_KNOWLEDGE_UNAVAILABLE`; recompute failure → retry + alert |
| Dependencies | FR-02 KPI engine, FR-03 backfill, FR-20 rectification |
| Test Guidance | **As-of-knowledge reproduction (June-in-June vs June-in-September); restatement lineage; append-only preservation; determinism** |

## 7. UI Requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Information architecture | Left nav by persona/category: My Dashboard, Workforce, Operational, Compliance, Reports, Predictive, Establishment (officers), Data Health (operators), Anomalies (auditor/admin), Data-Protection (DPO). Role determines visible sections. |
| Dashboard canvas | Responsive grid; KPI tiles, charts, tables; per-widget freshness badge (**role-adaptive copy**); plain-language KPI definition on consumer tiles; drill breadcrumbs; "save as my view". |
| KPI tiles | Value + unit + trend sparkline + period-correct target/RAG + alert badge + as-of + **plain-language "what counts"** + **reconciliation-explainer link**; click → drill-down; suppressed cells show "<5". |
| Charts | Line/bar/pie/donut/heatmap/gauge/table for consumers; HEATMAP/FUNNEL/MAP retained in the **authoring** catalog only (consumer palette trims MAP/FUNNEL). Accessible (labels, patterns + colour, keyboard, data-table fallback). |
| Report builder | Three-pane; sensitivity chips; **inline aggregate-vs-detail RESTRICTED explainer**; masked-field tooltips; row-count + freshness + suppression indicators. |
| Filters | Period, org_unit (scoped tree), cadre, designation, gender, category, **as-of-knowledge date**; shareable as saved_view. |
| Freshness UX | Green/amber/red chip with icon + label (non-colour cue); **role-adaptive tooltip** (plain for leaders, technical for operators); reconciliation explainer; global data-health panel. |
| Predictive UX | Aggregate/banded distributions open; **individual scores behind an explicit action + purpose prompt + friction confirmation**; prominent advisory + prohibited-use banner; model-card link. |
| Establishment UX | Position console (sanctioned strength, roster point, effective dates); data-quality flags for unmapped posts. |
| Data-protection UX | DPO console for rectification/erasure with impact preview, retention-override (legal basis), propagation status; affected surfaces note "data updated/erased per data-protection request". |
| Anomaly UX | Auditor/Admin anomaly queue with evidence and review actions. |
| Empty/loading/error states | Every surface defines: loading skeleton-with-context, empty ("no data in your scope"), error (with retry), permission ("not authorised"), stale (degraded banner), offline (non-restricted cached + stale), **suppressed ("below privacy threshold")**, **gated ("open individual prediction — purpose required")**. |
| Drill-through | "Open source record" visible only when permitted; opens owning module read-only; suppression notice. |
| Alerts | Alert inbox with severity chips; acknowledge/resolve; tile badges; period-correct target. |
| Exports | PDF/Excel/CSV menu with progress; header/footer carry scope + as-of + **as-of-knowledge** + page numbers + masking/suppression notes. |
| Mobile | Stacked cards, swipeable trends, bottom-nav, alert badge; same RLS + suppression; **offline excludes RESTRICTED; encrypted cache; remote-wipe**. |
| Embedded BI | Snippet uses header/code-exchange (**no URL token**); CSP frame-ancestors; revocation surfaced. |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard-operable charts, focus order, contrast, data-table fallback, screen-reader summaries, no colour-only meaning. |
| i18n/locale | Dates `DD-MMM-YYYY`, INR money formatting, user timezone for as-of, translatable labels (incl. role-adaptive copy). |
| Theming | Light/dark mode; enterprise-portal visual compliance. |

## 8. API & Integration

### 8.1 Conventions (async audit-on-read — v2)

- Base path `/api/v1/analytics`; OIDC/JWT auth; RBAC + RLS + suppression enforced server-side on every data-bearing endpoint.
- All list endpoints paginated (`page`/`limit`, max 100) or cursor-based; all data-bearing reads include a `dataFreshness` block (`{ asOf, state, isPartial, label }` where `label` is role-adaptive).
- **Audit-on-read is asynchronous and batched (R5):** every data-returning call **enqueues** an `analytics_access_log` write to an append-only **partitioned** store off the read path; it does not block the response. **Full-fidelity** logging (`log_fidelity=FULL`) is mandatory and synchronous-to-queue for `EXPORT`, `DRILLTHROUGH`, `NL_QUERY`, `VIEW_INDIVIDUAL_PREDICTION`, and all RESTRICTED reads; **`VIEW_DASHBOARD` of low-sensitivity data may be sampled** (`log_fidelity=SAMPLED`). High-fidelity events mirror into the shared `audit_log`.
- Reads accept an optional `asOfKnowledge` parameter (FR-23) for bitemporal reproducibility.
- Embed credentials are never accepted in a URL path/query (FR-15); they are presented in a header or exchanged from a short-lived code.

## 12. Reporting & Analytics

M14 **is** the reporting and analytics module; this section summarises its self-reporting and the catalog it exposes.

- **Standard report catalog (seed):** Headcount by org/cadre; Attrition; **Establishment-pinned vacancy (sanctioned-vs-filled)**; Demographics & diversity (suppressed); Retirement profile (deterministic, 1/3/5Y); Span of control; Leave & absenteeism; Attendance exceptions; Payroll cost & overtime (locked); Training coverage & skill gaps; Appraisal rating distribution; Disciplinary case aging; Transfer/promotion pipeline; Pension forecast; **Reservation roster compliance (establishment-pinned)**; Mandatory training status; SR verification status; Pending approvals & SLA breaches.
- **Self-analytics (operations):** Most-viewed dashboards/reports, export volume, query latency, ETL health, **watermark-relative reconciliation status**, alert volume by severity, **async-log queue depth**, **access-anomaly trends**, **DPDP propagation completeness** — for the Analytics Administrator, Auditor, and DPO.
- **Export formats:** PDF, XLSX, CSV — all scope-correct, suppressed, freshness-stamped, **as-of-knowledge-stamped**, audited.
- **Governance:** Every report maps to governed KPIs/semantic fields; reconciliation reports prove mart-to-source consistency at watermark; access logs (+ anomaly detection) provide preventive who-saw-what for audit; model cards govern predictions.

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data Migration

- M14 holds no transactional master data to migrate; migration = **standing up the analytics layer**: build mart schemas + **bitemporal snapshot store** + **partitioned access ledger**, define the semantic model, **register source data contracts (FR-21)**, register marts, **seed the establishment/position reference (FR-19)**, and run initial **full historical backfill** from M01–M13.
- Seed governed `kpi_definition`s (+ `definition_hash`), **effective-dated targets (E17)**, dashboard templates per persona, `rls_scope_policy` mappings (**through the maker-checker workflow**), `suppression_policy`, and the standard report catalog.
- Backfill bitemporal `kpi_snapshot` history (configurable horizon, e.g. 24 months) with knowledge_time = backfill instant.

### 13.2 Validation & Parallel Run

- Reconcile each seeded KPI against its owning module **at a fixed watermark** within per-KPI tolerance; record/resolve variances before go-live.
- Run the **RLS scope-leak AND aggregate-re-identification (suppression) test matrix** across all roles/marts; zero leakage and zero re-identification required to launch.
- Validate freshness SLAs, watermark-relative reconciliation, and degraded-mode with simulated mart outages and CDC lag.
- Validate **as-of-knowledge reproduction** (June-in-June vs June-after-correction).
- Validate predictive **fairness gate, friction-gate, and prohibited-use labelling**; validate **DPDP propagation** end-to-end.
- Verify export fidelity, scheduled delivery scoping, embed **header/code-exchange + revocation**, and NL **confidence gating**.

### 13.3 Cutover & Launch (phased — v2)

- **Phase 1 (foundation):** source contracts + Debezium CDC; `MART_HEADCOUNT` + establishment reference; RLS rewriter + **scope-leak + suppression harness**; KPI engine + bitemporal snapshots; freshness + reconciliation explainer; persona dashboards; deterministic retirement.
- **Phase 2:** workforce/operational/compliance suites; report builder; export/schedule; drill; alerts (effective-dated); benchmarking.
- **Phase 3 (advanced):** probabilistic predictive (fairness-gated); NL query (confidence-gated) + hardened embed; mobile/briefing (offline policy); access-anomaly detection.
- Soft-launch to HR/operators, then department heads/executives, then employee self-service.

### 14.2 Dependency Graph (phased build order — v2)

**Phase 1 — Foundation (must precede everything):**
1. **FR-21** (source contracts) + **FR-03** (marts/ETL) + **FR-19** (establishment reference) →
2. **FR-04** (RLS + maker-checker) + **FR-17** (metric suppression + scope-leak/re-identification harness) →
3. **FR-02** (KPI engine + effective-dated targets) + **FR-23** (bitemporal) + **FR-12** (freshness + reconciliation explainer) →
4. **FR-01** (dashboards) + **FR-13** (deterministic retirement).

**Phase 2 — Core analytics:**
5. **FR-05**, **FR-06**, **FR-07** (suites) → 6. **FR-08** (builder), **FR-10** (drill) → 7. **FR-09** (export/schedule), **FR-11** (alerts, effective-dated), **FR-14** (benchmark).

**Phase 3 — Advanced (deferred, highest-risk):**
8. **FR-18** (probabilistic predictive + fairness gate), **FR-20** (DPDP propagation) → 9. **FR-15** (NL confidence-gated + hardened embed), **FR-16** (mobile/briefing + offline policy), **FR-22** (anomaly detection).

> Rationale (council E/C/D): build the RLS rewriter + scope-leak/re-identification harness against one real mart (`MART_HEADCOUNT`) before any dashboard; ship deterministic retirement early; defer NL/embed and probabilistic ML to Phase 3.

### 14.3 Parallel-Agent Plan

| Stream | FRs | Can parallelise after |
|---|---|---|
| A: Contracts, data layer & establishment | FR-21, FR-03, FR-19 | start |
| B: Security & metric privacy | FR-04, FR-17 | A |

## 15. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| KPI | A governed, versioned metric definition computed consistently across surfaces; every snapshot stamps `kpi_version` + `definition_hash` |
| Data mart | A purpose-built, pre-aggregated analytical dataset derived read-only from source modules via a data contract |
| Source data contract | A versioned promise of a source module's schema/semantics consumed by a mart, CI-tested (Debezium CDC) |
| Semantic model | Business-friendly mapping of names/dimensions to physical mart columns used by the builder and NL query |
| RLS | Row-Level Security — query-time filtering of rows to a user's permitted scope (maker-checker governed) |
| Complementary suppression | Hiding additional cells so a suppressed small-cell value cannot be recovered by subtracting visible totals |
| Bitemporal snapshot | A snapshot carrying both valid-time (period described) and knowledge-time (when known) |
| As-of-knowledge | A read parameter returning the value as it was known at a given instant, for audit reproducibility |
| Watermark-relative reconciliation | Comparing a mart at watermark W to the source as of the same watermark W, not wall-clock now |
| Effective-dated target | A KPI target/threshold valid for a date range; target-vs-actual uses the value in force for the shown period |
| Establishment / position reference | The named source of record for sanctioned strength and roster points (FR-19); vacancy/reservation denominator |
| Friction-gate | A deliberate action + purpose prompt + RESTRICTED authority + audit required to open an individual predictive score |
| Model card | A published description of a predictive model's purpose, features, exclusions, fairness assessment, and prohibited use |
| Adverse-impact testing | Disparate-impact evaluation across protected groups, required before a probabilistic model activates |
| DPDP propagation | Pipeline that pushes a PII correction/erasure across marts, snapshots, predictions, and export artefacts |
| Role-adaptive language | Freshness/KPI copy rendered plainly for leaders and technically for operators/auditors |
| Reconciliation explainer | A user panel explaining why a number differs from the source (as-of, watermark, in-flight correction) |
| Embed token | A scoped, signed, expiring, revocable credential presented via header/code-exchange (never URL), CSP frame-ancestors-restricted |
| Access anomaly | A detected deviation in analytics access (bulk export, scope probing) raised for review |
| Advisory output | A predictive/estimated figure labelled non-authoritative, never written to source, never the sole basis for action |
| Drill-through | Navigating from an analytics leaf to the authoritative source record (read-only, permissioned) |

### 16.2 KPI Calculation Reference (illustrative)

| KPI | Definition |
|---|---|
| HEADCOUNT_ACTIVE | `COUNT(employee_id) WHERE employment_status='ACTIVE'` at scope/period |
| ATTRITION_RATE | `leavers_in_window / avg_headcount_in_window × 100` (excludes internal transfers) |
| VACANCY_PCT | `(sanctioned − filled) / sanctioned × 100` by cadre/post; **sanctioned from establishment_position (FR-19)** |
| RETIREMENT_DUE_COUNT | `COUNT(employee_id) WHERE retirement_date BETWEEN now AND now+horizon` (deterministic) |
| MANDATORY_TRAINING_PCT | `completed_mandatory / required_mandatory × 100` |
| RESERVATION_COMPLIANCE_PCT | `filled_against_category / sanctioned_for_category × 100` vs roster points (establishment-pinned) |
| PENDING_SLA_BREACH | `COUNT(workflow_task) WHERE status='PENDING' AND age > sla_threshold` (effective-dated SLA) |
| ABSENTEEISM_RATE | `lwp_days / scheduled_days × 100` at scope/period |

### 16.3 Freshness State Semantics (dual-register — v2)

| State | Technical meaning (operators/auditors) | Plain-language label (leaders/employees) | UI |
|---|---|---|---|
| FRESH | Within freshness SLA | "Up to date" | Green chip |
| STALE | Past SLA, last good served | "Numbers are a bit behind — source still updating" | Amber chip + tooltip |
| DEGRADED | Sustained watermark-relative variance / partial load | "Some figures may be off while we reconcile" | Amber/red + warning |
| FAILED | Refresh failed; last good retained | "Latest update didn't complete — showing the last good figures" | Red banner + icon |
| NO_DATA | Never refreshed / empty | "No data yet" | Grey |

### 16.4 Privacy & Suppression Policy (extended to metrics — v2)

- Small-cell suppression default `k=5` (per-KPI/per-policy override) applied to **KPI tiles, charts, exports, AND drill-through** — not drill-through alone.
- **Complementary suppression**: when a cell is suppressed, complementary cells are suppressed so the value cannot be recovered by subtracting visible totals, including across overlapping scopes and across this-period-vs-last-period differencing.
- RESTRICTED fields (salary, individual ratings, disciplinary detail, **individual predictive scores**) masked unless explicit field grant; individual predictive scores additionally friction-gated (FR-18).
- View/drill/export of RESTRICTED data always audited (full fidelity) with row counts; suppression decisions are deterministic so trends remain stable.
- The aggregate re-identification (differencing-attack) test harness is a launch gate (§13.4).

### 16.5 Predictive Fairness & Governance Policy (v2)

- **Protected/correlated exclusions:** caste/reservation category, gender, disability status, and maternity-linked leave proxies are excluded from probabilistic model features.
- **Pre-activation gate:** model card published; adverse-impact/disparate-impact testing recorded; `fairness_status ∈ {PASSED, WAIVED_WITH_REASON}` (DPO co-sign); methodology + intended_use + prohibited_use present.
- **Prohibited use:** an individual score must not be the sole or primary basis for any administrative action; this clause is displayed wherever the score appears.
- **Friction-gate:** individual scores require a deliberate action, a stated purpose, RESTRICTED authority, and a full-fidelity audit entry; aggregate/banded distributions are open to authorised scope.
- **Drift:** detected drift freezes a model's results read-only pending re-assessment.

### 16.6 DPDP Rectification/Erasure Reconciliation (v2)

- Append-only ledgers are reconciled with erasure via **restriction/redaction + bitemporal knowledge-versioning**, never by deleting historical audit rows.
- Where statutory retention (e.g., pension) overrides erasure, the change is `BLOCKED_RETENTION` with a recorded `legal_basis`, and the data is restricted from rendering rather than deleted.
- Export artefacts in M13 are marked `REDACTED` and regenerated where lawful; predictions are purged; affected snapshots are restated as new knowledge-versions.

### 16.7 Embed & NL Security Policy (v2)

- Embed credentials are presented via header or short-lived code-exchange — **never** in a URL path/query; tokens are issued maker-checker, scoped, signed, expiring, revocable, and rotatable; `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` is enforced from the token's allow-list; scope is re-validated per render.
- NL query uses a **named on-prem LLM hosted at the CGG Data Centre** (no HR prompt/data egress); intent is mapped only to the governed semantic model; below the confidence threshold the assistant clarifies or refuses; every interpretation + confidence + outcome is logged to `nl_query_log` for misinterpretation audit.

### 16.8 Assumptions Log

- Marts refresh read-only from contracted source views / Debezium CDC; M14 never writes source tables.
- RBAC + org hierarchy is authoritative for scope; M14 mirrors, never redefines; RLS/embed mutations are maker-checked.
- Payroll/cost analytics use locked snapshots only.
- Predictive outputs are advisory, fairness-governed, friction-gated, and never recorded against source modules.
- Sanctioned strength/roster points come from the establishment/position reference (FR-19), the named denominator authority.
- Snapshots are bitemporal; corrections create knowledge-versions; DPDP changes propagate across the estate reconciled with retention.
- Single legal entity; mart schema is entity-aware for future multi-entity.
- Per ADR-01, only the governed core holds DB credentials; charting/export/scheduling/NL-orchestration are adopted libraries over governed result sets.
