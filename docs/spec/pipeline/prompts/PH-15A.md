/goal
  objective: Take the PS10 income-tax/TDS engine and statutory certificates to BRD depth. The coverage delta
    (docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md) names the PS10 "TDS/tax engine, Form-16/24Q" backlog as still
    NOT_FOUND after PH-09. Implement: employee tax_declarations (E15) with regime handling — switching regime
    (old/new) recomputes the full pipeline (gross taxable -> standard_deduction -> Chapter VI-A -> slab ->
    surcharge with marginal relief -> 4% cess -> rebate_87a -> 89(1)/Form-10E relief) and per-month TDS;
    TDS projection per FR-PS10-07 BR2: TDS = (projected annual tax - YTD TDS derived from the immutable
    payslip_lines ledger) / remaining months; Form-16 generation per FR-PS10-17 with the tie-out AC1 (Form-16
    TDS totals tie to SIGMA of TDS payslip_lines for the FY, and Part A derives ONLY from statutory_remittances
    rows in MATCHED status); Form-24Q quarterly aggregation whose quarterly totals reconcile to monthly TDS
    (FR-17 AC2). Declarations lock after the FY proof cutoff (FR-07 AC3).
  context:
    - docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md      # PS10 remaining: TDS/tax engine, Form-16/24Q

  constraints:
    - All money in integer paise; no parseFloat/toFixed in tax math; deterministic recompute for the same inputs.
    - TDS YTD comes ONLY from the payslip_lines ledger (VAL-PS10-YTD-DERIVE); never a mutable running counter.
    - Regime switch recomputes every persisted pipeline stage on tax_declarations (each intermediate value stored).
    - Declaration mutation after the FY proof cutoff throws the registered mutation-after-freeze code
      ERR-PS10-SNAPSHOT-FROZEN (409) as the thrown error.code — the BRD registers no declaration-specific code;
      do NOT mint a new ERR identifier.
    - Form-16 Part A is blocked while any TDS statutory_remittances row for the FY is not MATCHED (FR-17 AC5 /
      "undeposited TDS -> Part A blocked"); missing slab rows throw ERR-PS10-TAXSLAB-NOTFOUND.
    - Form-24Q quarterly totals must reconcile to the monthly TDS payslip_lines in the quarter; mismatch blocks.
    - Parameterised queries only; transactions around multi-step writes; no console.log; no stack traces in responses.
    - Do NOT weaken any oracle under docs/spec/pipeline/checks/**; do NOT touch phases.yaml, .state/, or approvals/.

  evidence_required:
    - apps/api/src/modules/ps10/** tax engine code naming tax_declarations, statutory_remittances, MATCHED,
      Form-16/Form-24Q, the pipeline stage fields, and the registered ERR codes above
    - apps/api/test/*.test.cjs: regime recompute + Form-16 tie-out + both fail-closed negatives + 24Q test
    - `bash docs/spec/pipeline/checks/ph-15a.sh` GREEN (external oracle; not self-certified)
  escalate_when:
    - A slab/surcharge/cess/87A threshold has no grounded source in BRD/DDL/seed data (do not invent statutory numbers).
    - The YTD ledger lacks a fact the projection needs (raise against the PH-09 engine; do not add a mutable counter).
    - Form-16 tie-out is impossible because remittance rows cannot reach MATCHED in tests (build the capture/match
      path; do not stub the gate open).
