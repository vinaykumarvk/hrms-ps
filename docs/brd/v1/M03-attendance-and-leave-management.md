## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Attendance and Leave Management module (M03-ATL) is the time-and-absence system of record for the HRMS. It captures **when and how employees work** (biometric / RFID / mobile-geo punches, shifts, rosters, overtime, work-from-home, on-duty/tour, holidays) and **when and why they are absent** (a full public-sector leave catalog with configurable accrual, carry-forward, encashment, and a fully auditable leave-balance ledger). It exposes self-service to employees, team controls to managers, configuration to HR, and feeds two downstream systems of record: the statutory **Digital Service Register** (via Module 04-LSR → M12-SR) and **Payroll** (M10-PAY) for loss-of-pay treatment.

### 1.2 Business problem
Public-sector time and leave administration is today fragmented across registers, spreadsheets, and disconnected biometric devices. This causes: leave balances that cannot be trusted, manual loss-of-pay (LWP) errors in payroll, no statutory leave posting into the Service Register, no team visibility for managers, and no audit trail for regularisation and backdating. M03-ATL replaces this with a single configurable engine and immutable ledgers.

### 1.3 Goals & success metrics
| # | Goal | Metric / target |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Trustworthy leave balances | 100% of balance changes traceable to a ledger entry; zero unreconciled balances at year-close. |
| G2 | Automated attendance capture | ≥ 95% of daily attendance auto-computed without manual intervention. |
| G3 | Accurate payroll feed | 0 LWP discrepancies between M03 export and M10 import per cycle. |
| G4 | Statutory compliance | 100% of approved leave events posted to Digital SR (via M04) within SLA. |
| G5 | Self-service adoption | ≥ 90% of leave applications submitted by employees themselves (web/mobile). |
| G6 | Approval timeliness | P50 leave-approval turnaround ≤ 24h; auto-escalation on breach. |

### 1.4 Scope summary
**In scope:** shift & roster management; holiday calendars by location; punch ingestion & deduplication; daily attendance processing; missed-punch regularisation; overtime; WFH; on-duty/tour; compensatory-off; leave-type & accrual policy configuration; accrual engine; leave-balance ledger; leave application/approval/cancellation; backdated leave; team calendar & conflict detection; leave-year close (carry-forward / lapse); encashment (incl. on retirement); attendance-and-leave → payroll feed.
**Out of scope (referenced, not built here):** statutory SR posting internals (M04/M12), payroll computation (M10), terminal-benefit settlement (M11), document storage internals (M13), cross-module analytics surface (M14).

### 1.5 Key stakeholders
Employees, Reporting Managers, HR Officers/Admins, Department Heads/Sanctioning Authorities, Payroll Officers (consumers), SR Custodian (consumer via M04), Auditors, System Administrators.

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### 2.1 Feature Module Map
| Area | Sub-area | FRs |
|---|---|---|
| **Time & Attendance** | Shift & roster management | FR-01 |
| | Holiday calendar by location | FR-02 |
| | Punch ingestion (biometric/RFID/mobile-geo) | FR-03 |
| | Daily attendance processing & status computation | FR-04 |
| | Missed-punch regularisation | FR-05 |
| | Overtime capture & approval | FR-06 |
| | Work-from-home (WFH) | FR-07 |
| | On-duty / tour / outdoor duty | FR-08 |
| | Compensatory-off earning & redemption | FR-09 |

| | Backdated leave & team-calendar conflict detection | FR-14 |
| | Leave-year close: carry-forward, lapse, half-pay conversion | FR-15 |
| | Leave encashment (in-service & on retirement) | FR-16 |
| **Integration** | Attendance & leave → payroll (LWP) feed | FR-17 |
| | Mobile/web self-service surface & notification triggers | FR-18 |

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from Shared Foundation)
- RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; maker-checker via shared `workflow_instances`/`workflow_tasks`.
- Immutable `audit_log` write on every state change; soft delete (`is_deleted`) except append-only ledgers.
- UTC storage, locale display (`DD-MMM-YYYY`), INR currency; cursor/page pagination (max 100).
- Canonical API error envelope and standard error codes; OIDC/SSO + MFA + JWT.

### 2.3 Boundaries & ownership
| Concern | Owner | M03 relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Employee master, designation, org tree | M01-EPM | **Reads** (golden source). |
| Statutory SR ledger | M12-SR (written via M04-LSR) | **Emits** approved-leave events to M04; never writes SR directly. |
| Payroll computation | M10-PAY | **Emits** LWP/OT/attendance feed; M10 computes pay. |
| Terminal benefits / pension | M11-PEN | **Supplies** leave-encashment-eligible balance on retirement. |
| Document storage | M13-DMS | **References** `documents` for medical certificates, tour orders. |
| Notifications delivery | Shared platform | **Triggers** `notifications`. |

## 3. Roles & Permissions

### 3.1 Module roles (extend shared baseline; do not contradict)
| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Employee (Self-Service)** | Apply/cancel own leave, view own balance & ledger, regularise own punches, apply WFH/OD/comp-off/OT, view own roster & holidays. |
| **Reporting Manager** | Approve/recommend leave, regularisation, OT, WFH, OD for direct reports; view team calendar; flag conflicts. |
| **HR Officer** | Configure rosters/holidays per scope, operate on behalf of employees, run accrual/close, correct ledger via adjustment. |
| **HR Admin** | All HR Officer rights + leave-type/policy configuration, year-close execution, org-wide reports. |
| **Sanctioning Authority (Dept Head)** | Final sanction for special leaves (Maternity, Study, Sabbatical, Commuted, LWP, encashment). |
| **Payroll Officer** | Read-only consumer of the LWP/OT feed; trigger/reconcile export. |
| **Auditor** | Read-only across all entities incl. ledger and audit log. No write. |
| **System Administrator** | Device registration, integration config, enum/reference master data; no transactional self-approval. |

### 3.2 Permission matrix (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, D=Soft-Delete, A=Approve, X=Execute job; blank=none)
| Capability | Employee | Manager | HR Officer | HR Admin | Sanct. Auth | Payroll | Auditor | SysAdmin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| View own attendance/leave | R | R | R | R | R | | R | |
| View team attendance/leave | | R | R | R | R | | R | |
| Apply leave / WFH / OD / comp-off / OT | C | C(self) | C(on behalf) | C(on behalf) | | | | |
| Approve leave / regularisation / OT | | A | A | A | A | | | |
| Sanction special leave & encashment | | | R | A | A | | | |
| Regularise missed punch | C(self) | A | C/A | C/A | | | R | |
| Configure shifts / rosters | | R | C/U | C/U | | | R | |
| Configure holidays | | R | C/U | C/U | | | R | |
| Configure leave types & accrual policy | | | R | C/U | | | R | |
| Run accrual / year-close job | | | X(scope) | X | | | R | |
| Ledger manual adjustment (maker-checker) | | | C(maker) | A(checker) | | | R | |
| Run/reconcile payroll feed export | | | R | R | | X | R | |
| Register devices / integration config | | | | R | | | R | C/U |
| View audit log | own | team | scope | org | scope | | all | scope |

**Segregation of duties:** maker ≠ checker; no self-approval (an employee who is also a manager cannot approve their own leave); ledger adjustments always require a distinct checker.

## 4. Shared Application Foundation
This module **inherits** the Shared Foundation (`docs/brd/SHARED_FOUNDATION.md`) without redefinition:
- **Entities reused:** `employees`, `users`, `org_units`, `designations`, `cadres`, `roles`/`permissions`, `service_register_events`, `documents`, `notifications`, `audit_log`, `workflow_instances`, `workflow_tasks`.
- **Conventions:** UUIDv4 PKs + human business keys; standard audit columns; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE enums; UTC storage / locale display; paginated lists (max 100); maker-checker through the shared workflow engine.
- **Tech defaults:** React+TS (Tailwind/shadcn) front-end; REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL; object storage for documents; OIDC/SSO+MFA+JWT; RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping.
- **Error envelope:** `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field" }, "requestId" }`.
- **NFR baseline:** P95 < 500ms; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15min / RTO ≤ 4h; OWASP ASVS; DPDP-Act-2023-aligned PII handling.

M03 extends the shared workflow engine with module workflow templates (leave approval, regularisation, encashment) and the shared `notifications` ledger with module event types.

### 5.6 Data integrity rules
1. **Ledger-balance reconciliation:** `leave_balances.current_balance` MUST equal the `balance_after` of the latest `leave_balance_ledger` entry for that (employee, leave_type, leave_year). Enforced by trigger + nightly reconciliation job.
2. **Non-negative balances:** an `AVAIL`/`ENCASHMENT` debit cannot drive `balance_after` below 0 except for leave types explicitly allowing advance (e.g. Maternity) configured in policy.
3. **Append-only ledgers:** `leave_balance_ledger`, `comp_off_ledger`, `attendance_punches` permit INSERT only; corrections via compensating entries (`ADJUSTMENT`/`AVAIL_REVERSAL`), never UPDATE/DELETE.
4. **One status per day:** UNIQUE(`employee_id`,`attendance_date`) on `attendance_daily`; UNIQUE(`employee_id`,`leave_date`) across active leave application days (no double-booking).
5. **Idempotent ingestion:** UNIQUE(`device_id`,`source_ref`) on punches; replays mark `DUPLICATE`.
6. **Transactional writes:** leave approval = (insert ledger debit + update balance + update application status + enqueue SR posting + enqueue notification) in a single DB transaction.
7. **FK integrity:** all employee/org references resolve to active M01 records; soft-deleted employees block new applications.
8. **Gender/eligibility guard:** Maternity/CCL restricted to `gender_eligibility=FEMALE`; Paternity to `MALE`; cadre restrictions enforced at apply-time.
9. **Date sanity:** `end_date >= start_date`; backdated leave only within configurable window; future-dated punches rejected.
10. **No self-approval:** `workflow_tasks.assignee_id` ≠ application `created_by`/`employee_id`.

## 6. Functional Requirements

> Each FR carries: ID, Module, Primary Role(s), User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Business Rules, Data Model References, API References, UI Behavior Notes, Edge Cases, and a Low-Level Design table.

---

### FR-01 — Shift & Roster Management
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer, HR Admin (configure); Employee/Manager (view)
- **User Story:** As an HR Officer, I want to define shifts and assign employees to rosters so that attendance is evaluated against the correct working pattern.
- **Description:** Create/maintain shift definitions (timings, grace, thresholds, night flag, breaks) and assign employees to shifts over date ranges with a weekly-off pattern. Supports rotating rosters and bulk assignment by org unit.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. HR can create a shift with start/end/grace/thresholds and scope.
  2. HR can assign one or more employees to a shift for a date range with a weekly-off pattern.
  3. Overlapping PUBLISHED rosters for the same employee/date are rejected with `ROSTER_OVERLAP`.
  4. Publishing a roster supersedes any prior open-ended roster for the same employee from the new `effective_from`.
  5. Employees and managers can view applicable shift/weekly-off for any date.
- **Business Rules:**
  - Night shifts (`is_night_shift=true`) attribute the worked period to the shift start date.
  - Weekly-off pattern supports fixed days and alternating Saturdays (e.g. `SAT2`,`SAT4`).
  - Only ACTIVE shifts may be assigned.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | shifts | CRUD shift master |
  | rosters | Assignment records |
  | org_units, employees | Scope & assignee |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/shifts | Create shift |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/rosters | Assign roster |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/rosters?employeeId= | View roster |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Shift form with time pickers; roster assignment grid with multi-select employees and a visual weekly-off picker; conflict banner on overlap.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-period shift change; employee transferred (M05) mid-roster; alternating-Saturday boundary at month/year edge; DST not applicable (IST fixed).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `ShiftService`, `RosterService`, `RosterConflictValidator`, React `RosterPlanner` |
  | Backend Flow | Validate scope → check overlap → persist → publish supersedes prior → audit |
  | Data Operations | INSERT shifts/rosters; UPDATE prior roster `status=SUPERSEDED` (txn) |
  | Validation | Time order, threshold sanity, overlap, ACTIVE shift only |
  | Authorization | RBAC HR + org-unit scope |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | roster DRAFT→PUBLISHED→SUPERSEDED; triggers attendance recompute for affected future days |
  | Failure Handling | `ROSTER_OVERLAP` 409; `INVALID_SHIFT_TIMES` 400 |
  | Dependencies | M01 employees, org_units |
  | Test Guidance | Overlap rejection; night-shift date attribution; supersede chain; alt-Saturday calc |

---

### FR-02 — Holiday Calendar Management (by location)
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin (configure); all (view)
- **User Story:** As an HR Admin, I want location-specific holiday calendars so attendance and leave-day computation honour the right holidays per office.
- **Description:** Define yearly holiday calendars bound to org/location scope, with gazetted/restricted/sectional/optional types; employees elect Restricted Holidays (RH) within a cap.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. HR can create a calendar for a year/location and add holidays.
  2. Duplicate date in the same calendar is rejected (`HOLIDAY_DUPLICATE`).
  3. Publishing a calendar makes it the basis for attendance/leave computation in scope.
  4. Employees can elect up to N restricted holidays (configurable).
  5. Holidays sandwiched between leave can be configured to count or not.
- **Business Rules:** A holiday on a roster weekly-off does not double-grant; an employee inherits the calendar of their org unit/location; RH cap default 2.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | holiday_calendars | Calendar master |
  | holidays | Dates |
  | org_units | Location scope |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/holiday-calendars | Create calendar |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/holiday-calendars/{id}/holidays | Add holiday |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/holidays?date=&orgUnitId= | Resolve holidays |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Calendar grid view; bulk import (CSV) of holidays; RH-election self-service with remaining-count badge.
- **Edge Cases:** Mid-year office relocation (which calendar applies); national vs sectional overlap on same date; RH already availed when calendar edited.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `HolidayCalendarService`, `HolidayResolver`, `RHElectionService` |
  | Backend Flow | Resolve employee location → pick PUBLISHED calendar → return holiday set |
  | Data Operations | INSERT calendar/holidays; UPSERT RH election |
  | Validation | Unique date, RH cap, year match |
  | Authorization | HR Admin write; all read |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | DRAFT→PUBLISHED→ARCHIVED; recompute affected attendance_daily |
  | Failure Handling | `HOLIDAY_DUPLICATE` 409; `RH_CAP_EXCEEDED` 409 |
  | Dependencies | M01 org_units |
  | Test Guidance | Location resolution; RH cap; sandwich rule toggle |

### FR-03 — Attendance Punch Ingestion (biometric / RFID / mobile-geo)
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** System (devices), Employee (mobile/web), SysAdmin (device config)
- **User Story:** As the system, I want to reliably ingest punches from biometric/RFID devices and the mobile app so daily attendance can be computed accurately and idempotently.
- **Description:** Accept punch events from registered devices (batch push or pull) and from the mobile app with geofence validation; deduplicate; classify direction; store raw immutably.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A punch with a known `(device_id, source_ref)` already ingested is marked `DUPLICATE`, not re-stored.
  2. Mobile punches outside the device geofence are `REJECTED` with `GEOFENCE_VIOLATION`.
  3. Punches from unknown/inactive devices are rejected (`DEVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED`).
  4. Future-dated punches are rejected (`INVALID_PUNCH_TIME`).
  5. All accepted punches are immutable and append-only.
- **Business Rules:** Device authenticated via hashed API key/cert; mobile requires authenticated user + GPS; direction inferred (odd=IN/even=OUT) when not supplied; clock skew tolerance ±5 min.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | attendance_punches | Raw store |
  | attendance_devices | Source auth & geofence |
  | employees | Owner |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/punches/ingest | Device batch ingest |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/punches/mobile | Mobile geo punch |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Mobile "Punch In/Out" button with live GPS + map pin; confirmation toast with server time; offline queue with sync.
- **Edge Cases:** Device clock drift; duplicate replays after network retry; multiple devices same gate; GPS spoofing (flag + review); offline mobile punches synced later (timestamp = capture time).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `PunchIngestController`, `DeviceAuthFilter`, `GeofenceValidator`, `DedupeService` |
  | Backend Flow | Auth device/user → validate geofence/time → dedupe by source_ref → INSERT → enqueue daily-recompute |
  | Data Operations | INSERT punches only (append-only); UNIQUE conflict ⇒ DUPLICATE |
  | Validation | Device active, geofence, time skew, future-date |
  | Authorization | Device API key / authenticated user (self) |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Triggers FR-04 recompute for the punch date |
  | Failure Handling | `GEOFENCE_VIOLATION` 422; `DEVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED` 403; `INVALID_PUNCH_TIME` 400 |
  | Dependencies | attendance_devices, M01 |
  | Test Guidance | Idempotent replay; geofence boundary; offline-sync ordering; skew tolerance |

---

### FR-04 — Daily Attendance Processing & Status Computation
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** System (scheduled), HR Officer (rerun)
- **User Story:** As the system, I want to compute each employee's daily attendance status from punches, roster, holidays, leave, and exceptions so that downstream payroll and reports are accurate.
- **Description:** Nightly (and on-demand) batch derives `attendance_daily` by combining punches, roster/shift, holiday calendar, approved leave, and WFH/OD exceptions; computes worked minutes, late/early, and final status.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Days with approved leave → `ON_LEAVE`; holiday → `HOLIDAY`; weekly-off → `WEEKLY_OFF`.
  2. Worked minutes ≥ full-day threshold → `PRESENT`; between half and full → `HALF_DAY`; below → `ABSENT`.
  3. Punch-in only / out only → `MISSING_PUNCH`.
  4. WFH/OD approved → `WFH`/`ON_DUTY` regardless of punches.
  5. Re-running for a date is idempotent and overwrites only system-computed (non-regularised) rows.
- **Business Rules:** Precedence: Leave > Holiday > Weekly-off > WFH/OD > Punch-derived. Night-shift spans attributed to shift start date. Regularised days are not overwritten.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | attendance_daily | Output |
  | attendance_punches, rosters, holidays, leave_applications, attendance_exceptions | Inputs |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/attendance/process | Trigger run (date/scope) |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/attendance/daily?employeeId=&from=&to= | View |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Monthly attendance grid with color-coded statuses; legend; drill to punches; HR "reprocess" action with scope picker.
- **Edge Cases:** Late punch sync after run (auto re-trigger); employee with no roster (defaults to GEN or flagged); leave approved after processing (re-trigger); mid-day status change.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `AttendanceProcessor`, `StatusResolver`, scheduler job |
  | Backend Flow | For each employee/date: load inputs → apply precedence → compute minutes/late → UPSERT (skip regularised) → record `processing_run_id` |
  | Data Operations | UPSERT attendance_daily (UNIQUE employee/date) in batched txns |
  | Validation | Roster existence, input completeness |
  | Authorization | System; HR rerun scoped |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | Sets daily status; feeds FR-17; emits ABSENT alert notification |
  | Failure Handling | Partial-batch isolation; failed employee logged, batch continues; `PROCESSING_ERROR` 500 |
  | Dependencies | FR-01,02,03,07,08,12 |
  | Test Guidance | Precedence matrix; threshold boundaries; idempotent rerun; night-shift attribution |

- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (raise), Manager/HR (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to regularise a missed or incorrect punch with justification so my attendance reflects reality after approval.
- **Description:** Employee submits a correction for a `MISSING_PUNCH`/`ABSENT`/`HALF_DAY` day with proposed times and reason; routed to manager; on approval the daily status is corrected and locked as regularised.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Employee can raise regularisation only for own past days within the configurable window (default 15 days).
  2. Approval updates `attendance_daily` and sets `is_regularised=true`.
  3. Rejected requests leave attendance unchanged with reason logged.
  4. A monthly cap on regularisations is enforced (`REGULARISATION_LIMIT`).
  5. Audit captures before/after status.
- **Business Rules:** Cannot regularise a finalized/payroll-locked period; manager approval required; HR can act on behalf; document optional but configurable per status.

### FR-06 — Overtime Capture & Approval
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee/Manager (claim/recommend), HR/Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want approved overtime to be either paid or converted to compensatory-off so extra hours are fairly compensated.
- **Description:** Capture OT from worked-minutes beyond shift or on holidays/weekly-offs; submit claim with treatment (paid/comp-off); on approval, paid OT flows to payroll feed and comp-off credits the comp-off ledger.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. OT can only be claimed where actual worked minutes exceed shift end + grace (validated against punches).
  2. Approved `PAID` OT contributes `paid_ot_minutes` to the payroll feed.
  3. Approved `COMP_OFF` OT creates an `EARN` entry in `comp_off_ledger` with expiry.
  4. OT rate multiplier applies per policy (e.g. 2x on holidays).
  5. Duplicate OT for the same date is prevented.
- **Business Rules:** Comp-off earned expires after configurable days (default 90); holiday/weekly-off OT defaults to comp-off unless paid-OT policy applies; max OT/month cap.

### FR-07 — Work-From-Home (WFH)
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to request work-from-home days so my attendance is recorded as working without office punches.
- **Description:** Employee applies for WFH for a date range; on approval the affected days are computed as `WFH` (counted as present) in FR-04; optional WFH-day cap per month.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Approved WFH days show as `WFH` and count as present for payroll.
  2. WFH cannot overlap an existing approved leave/holiday.
  3. Monthly WFH cap enforced if configured.
  4. Manager approval required; HR can apply on behalf.
- **Business Rules:** WFH excluded on weekly-off/holiday (no-op); WFH may still require optional self check-in via mobile (policy).

### FR-08 — On-Duty / Tour / Outdoor Duty
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager/Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As a field officer, I want to record on-duty/tour days so my absence from the office is treated as official duty, not leave.
- **Description:** Capture On-Duty/Tour with location, purpose, and supporting order; approved days compute as `ON_DUTY` (present); links to tour order document.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Approved OD/Tour days show `ON_DUTY` and count as present.
  2. Tour requires a location and may require an order document.
  3. OD cannot overlap approved leave.
  4. Tour spanning weekly-off/holiday optionally counts per policy.
- **Business Rules:** Tour may generate comp-off if it includes holidays worked (policy); OD distinct from WFH in reports.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

### FR-09 — Compensatory-Off Earning & Redemption
- **Module:** Time & Attendance
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (redeem), System/Manager (earn/approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want comp-off credited for approved holiday/OT work and to redeem it as time off before it expires.
- **Description:** Maintain an append-only comp-off ledger; earn entries from FR-06/FR-08; redeem via a comp-off leave application; expire unused credits on a scheduled job.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Earn entries credit the ledger with an `expires_on`.
  2. Redemption debits FIFO from non-expired credits.
  3. Redemption beyond balance is rejected (`COMP_OFF_INSUFFICIENT`).
  4. A daily job expires past-due credits (`EXPIRE` entries) and notifies owners ahead of expiry.
  5. Ledger balance reconciles to `balance_after` of latest entry.
- **Business Rules:** FIFO consumption; default 90-day validity; comp-off counted as paid present day; no negative balance.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|

### FR-10 — Leave-Type & Accrual-Policy Configuration
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin
- **User Story:** As an HR Admin, I want to configure leave types and their accrual/carry-forward/encashment policies so the engine applies the correct statutory rules per cadre and office.
- **Description:** Maintain the leave catalog (CL, EL, HPL, Commuted, Maternity, Paternity, Child-Care, Study, Medical, Sabbatical, LWP, Comp-off) and versioned accrual policies scoped by org unit/cadre with caps, carry-forward, lapse, and encashment rules.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. HR can create/deactivate leave types with category, eligibility, document, and caps.
  2. HR can define a versioned accrual policy per type/scope with frequency, quantity, basis, caps, carry-forward, lapse rule, encashment cap.
  3. Overlapping ACTIVE policies for the same type/scope/date are rejected.
  4. Gender/cadre eligibility is enforced downstream at apply-time.
  5. Policy changes are versioned (effective_from/to), never destructive.
- **Business Rules:** Statutory caps preset (Maternity 180, Paternity 15, etc.) but editable; HPL = half-pay; Commuted leave debits 2× EL-equivalent per policy; LWP affects pay and service.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

### FR-11 — Accrual Engine & Leave-Balance Ledger
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** System (scheduled), HR Officer (adjust)
- **User Story:** As the system, I want to accrue leave per policy and record every balance change in an immutable ledger so balances are always auditable and reconcilable.
- **Description:** Scheduled accrual job credits leave per policy (annual/monthly/half-yearly, prorated by service/attendance) writing `ACCRUAL` ledger entries; every avail/encash/lapse/adjustment also writes the ledger; balances are the reconciled projection.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Accrual job credits the correct quantity per active policy and updates balance.
  2. Every balance mutation writes exactly one ledger entry with `balance_after`.
  3. `leave_balances.current_balance` always equals latest ledger `balance_after` (reconciliation passes).
  4. Pro-rated accrual on mid-year joining/leaving is computed per basis.
  5. Manual adjustments require maker-checker and a reason.
- **Business Rules:** Accrual respects `max_balance_cap`; suspended/LWP periods may suspend accrual per policy; HPL accrues separately; no balance change occurs outside the ledger.
- **Data Model References:**

### FR-12 — Leave Application & Approval Workflow
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager (recommend), HR/Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to apply for leave with half-day support and have it approved through the right chain, with my balance and the Service Register updated automatically.
- **Description:** Employee applies (type, dates, half-day portions, reason, document); system validates balance/eligibility/conflicts; routes through configurable approval chain; on approval, debits the ledger, sets attendance to ON_LEAVE, and (for SR-relevant types) enqueues a Digital SR posting via M04.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Total days computed excluding weekly-off/holidays unless sandwich rule applies; half-day = 0.5 unit.
  2. Application blocked if balance insufficient (except advance-allowed types) — `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`.
  3. On approval, a single transaction: ledger `AVAIL` debit + balance update + application APPROVED + attendance ON_LEAVE + SR enqueue + notification.
  4. Eligibility (gender/cadre/document) enforced.
  5. Approval chain configurable (Manager → HR; special leaves → Sanctioning Authority).
  6. SR-relevant approved leave sets `sr_posting_status=PENDING` then `POSTED` on M04 ack.
- **Business Rules:** No double-booking a day; Commuted/Medical require document; Maternity/CCL gender-restricted; advance leave only for configured types; balance held (soft-reserve) on submit to prevent oversubscription.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|

### FR-13 — Leave Cancellation & Modification
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (request), Manager/HR (approve)
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want to cancel or withdraw leave (whole or partial, before or after start) so unused leave is credited back correctly.
- **Description:** Support withdrawal of a SUBMITTED application and cancellation of an APPROVED one (full or partial future days); approved cancellation reverses the ledger debit (`AVAIL_REVERSAL`), restores attendance, and reverses/cancels any SR posting via M04.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. SUBMITTED application can be withdrawn by applicant (no approval needed) → balance soft-reserve released.
  2. APPROVED future leave can be cancelled (full/partial) with approval → `AVAIL_REVERSAL` credit for the cancelled days only.
  3. Past/availed days cannot be cancelled (`CANNOT_CANCEL_PAST`).
  4. Attendance for cancelled days recomputed; SR posting reversal enqueued for SR-relevant leave.
  5. Audit captures original vs revised.
- **Business Rules:** Partial cancellation only for future, contiguous-tail or specific days per policy; encashed/closed-year leave not cancellable; reversal amount = exact debited units for cancelled days.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |

### FR-14 — Backdated Leave & Team-Calendar Conflict Detection
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (apply), Manager (view/approve)
- **User Story:** As a manager, I want a team leave calendar that flags coverage conflicts and to control backdated leave so staffing and compliance are maintained.
- **Description:** Allow backdated leave within a configurable window with mandatory justification and elevated approval; provide a manager team calendar visualising leave/WFH/OD/holidays and flagging concurrent-absence thresholds.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Backdated leave permitted only within window (default 30 days) and flagged `is_backdated=true` with elevated approval.
  2. Team calendar shows all team members' leave/WFH/OD/holidays for a selected month.
  3. When concurrent approved absences exceed a configurable threshold (e.g. >30% of team), a conflict warning is shown to the approver.
  4. Backdated leave beyond window is rejected (`BACKDATE_WINDOW_EXCEEDED`).
  5. Manager can filter calendar by status/leave type.
- **Business Rules:** Backdated leave still validates balance for the relevant leave-year; conflict threshold advisory (does not auto-block) but recorded; calendar respects org-unit row-level scope.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | leave_applications | Backdate + calendar |
  | attendance_exceptions | Calendar overlay |

### FR-15 — Leave-Year Close: Carry-Forward, Lapse & HPL Conversion
- **Module:** Leave Management
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Admin
- **User Story:** As an HR Admin, I want to close the leave year, carrying forward eligible balances, lapsing excess, and converting per policy, with a dry-run before committing.
- **Description:** Year-close job processes each employee's balances per policy: compute carry-forward (capped), lapse excess, convert (e.g. EL→HPL) where configured, post opening balances for the new year — all via ledger entries; supports SIMULATED dry-run with report before COMMIT.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. SIMULATED run produces a report (per employee: carried/lapsed/converted/opening) without writing balances.
  2. COMMITTED run writes `CARRY_FORWARD`, `LAPSE`, `HPL_CONVERSION`, and `OPENING` ledger entries atomically per employee.
  3. Carry-forward respects `carry_forward_cap`; excess lapses per `lapse_rule`.
  4. New leave-year `leave_balances` rows are created with correct opening balances.
  5. A committed year cannot be re-committed (`YEAR_ALREADY_CLOSED`).
- **Business Rules:** EL excess beyond CF cap lapses; CL typically lapses fully (no CF); HPL may have no-lapse; close is irreversible except via maker-checker adjustment; run is idempotent per (year, scope).
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|

- **User Story:** As an employee (or retiree), I want to encash eligible leave so I receive payment for unused balance per policy, with retirement encashment feeding terminal benefits.
- **Description:** Submit encashment for encashable types within caps; on approval, debit ledger (`ENCASHMENT`) and post amount to the payroll feed; retirement encashment integrates with M11 terminal-benefit settlement and is capped (e.g. EL ≤ 300 days).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Encashment allowed only for `is_encashable` types within `encashment_cap_days` and `min_balance_for_encash`.
  2. Approval debits `ENCASHMENT` ledger entry and creates a payroll-feed amount.
  3. Retirement encashment (`RETIREMENT`) is linked to M11 and capped per policy.
  4. Estimated amount shown (M10 computes final pay).
  5. Insufficient/over-cap requests rejected.
- **Business Rules:** EL retirement encashment capped at 300 days (policy-editable); HPL not encashable; in-service encashment may need LTC linkage; settlement marks `SETTLED` after payroll ack.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | leave_encashment_requests | Request |
  | leave_balance_ledger | ENCASHMENT debit |
  | payroll_attendance_feed | Amount export |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/encashments | Request |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/encashments/{id}/decision | Approve/reject |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Encashment form with eligible-balance and cap display, estimated amount; retiree flow surfaced from M11 context.
- **Edge Cases:** Encashment + pending leave reducing balance; cap reached across multiple requests in a year; retirement date change; encashment then cancellation before settlement.
- **LLD:**

  | Authorization | Self request; HR/authority approve; payroll settle |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | SUBMITTED→APPROVED→SETTLED; balance reduced |
  | Failure Handling | `ENCASHMENT_CAP_EXCEEDED` 409; `NOT_ENCASHABLE` 422 |

### FR-17 — Attendance & Leave → Payroll (LWP) Feed
- **Module:** Integration
- **Primary Role(s):** System (generate), Payroll Officer (reconcile)
- **User Story:** As a Payroll Officer, I want an accurate per-period feed of LWP, half-pay, paid-OT, present days, and encashment so payroll computes pay correctly without manual reconciliation.
- **Description:** For each pay period, aggregate per-employee LWP days (from LWP/absent), half-pay days (HPL), paid-OT minutes, present days, and encashment amounts into `payroll_attendance_feed`; expose to M10 with ack handshake; lock the period to prevent retroactive change after export.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Feed generated per `pay_period` aggregates LWP, half-pay, paid-OT, present days, encashment per employee.
  2. LWP derived from `ABSENT` days + LWP-type leave; half-pay from HPL leave.
  3. After EXPORTED, the period is locked; later corrections require an adjustment entry in the next period.
  4. M10 ack updates status to `ACKED`; failures set `FAILED` with retry.
  5. Feed reconciles to attendance_daily + leave ledger for the period.
- **Business Rules:** Present-counting statuses: PRESENT, WFH, ON_DUTY, ON_LEAVE (paid), HALF_DAY (0.5); LWP/absent reduce pay; period lock aligns with FR-05/FR-13 lock guards.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | payroll_attendance_feed | Output |
  | attendance_daily, leave_applications, overtime_records, leave_encashment_requests | Inputs |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/payroll-feed/generate | Generate period feed |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/payroll-feed?payPeriod= | Retrieve |
  | POST | /api/v1/atl/payroll-feed/{id}/ack | M10 acknowledgement |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Payroll reconciliation screen: per-employee feed table, totals, export + lock action, ack status; discrepancy highlights.
- **Edge Cases:** Late regularisation after lock (next-period adjustment); employee transferred mid-period (split across org units); encashment settled in different period; re-generation before lock (overwrite).
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `PayrollFeedService`, `PeriodLockManager`, `FeedReconciler` |
  | Backend Flow | Aggregate period inputs → UPSERT feed (UNIQUE period/employee) → export → lock → on ack mark ACKED |
  | Data Operations | UPSERT feed; status transitions |
  | Validation | Period not double-locked; reconciliation |
  | Authorization | System generate; payroll read/ack |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | PENDING→EXPORTED→ACKED/FAILED; period lock set |
  | Failure Handling | `PERIOD_ALREADY_LOCKED` 409; `M10_ACK_TIMEOUT` retry |
  | Dependencies | FR-04/05/06/12/16, M10 |
  | Test Guidance | Aggregation accuracy; lock guard; ack handshake; reconciliation invariant |

### FR-18 — Mobile/Web Self-Service Surface & Notification Triggers
- **Module:** Integration / Self-Service
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee, Manager
- **User Story:** As an employee, I want a mobile and web self-service surface to punch, apply for leave, check balances, and receive timely notifications about my requests.
- **Description:** Unified self-service surface (web + mobile) exposing punch, leave apply/cancel, balance & ledger, comp-off wallet, team calendar (managers), and an approvals inbox; every lifecycle event triggers a `notifications` entry (push/email/in-app) via the shared platform.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Employee can punch, apply/cancel leave, view balance/ledger, and view request status from mobile and web.
  2. Manager can approve/reject from the inbox on mobile and web.
  3. Each state transition (submitted, recommended, approved, rejected, cancelled, low-balance, accrual-credited, comp-off-expiring, regularisation-decided) emits a notification.
  4. Notifications respect user channel preferences and are recorded in `notifications`.
  5. Surface is WCAG 2.1 AA compliant and responsive.
- **Business Rules:** Notifications are non-blocking (async); failures retried; sensitive details minimised in push payloads (deep-link to app); escalation reminder if an approval task is pending beyond SLA.
- **Data Model References:**
  | Entity | Use |
  |---|---|
  | notifications | Outbound ledger |
  | leave_applications, attendance_punches, comp_off_ledger, regularisation_requests | Event sources |
- **API References:**
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/self-service/summary | Dashboard data |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/approvals/inbox | Pending approvals |
  | GET | /api/v1/atl/notifications?status= | Notifications |
- **UI Behavior Notes:** Mobile-first dashboard: balance cards, quick-punch, apply-leave CTA, pending-approvals badge; in-app notification center; deep links.
- **Edge Cases:** Offline mobile (queued actions); duplicate notification suppression; channel preference off (in-app fallback); SLA escalation to next approver.
- **LLD:**
  | Aspect | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Components | `SelfServiceController`, `ApprovalInboxService`, `NotificationProducer`, React PWA |
  | Backend Flow | Aggregate self-service data; on each transition publish notification event → shared platform delivers |
  | Data Operations | INSERT notifications; read aggregations |
  | Validation | Auth (self/manager scope), channel prefs |
  | Authorization | Employee self; manager team |
  | State Changes & Side Effects | notification records; SLA escalation tasks |
  | Failure Handling | `NOTIFY_DELIVERY_FAILED` async-retry; degrade to in-app |
  | Dependencies | All FRs; shared notifications/workflow |
  | Test Guidance | Event→notification mapping; offline queue; escalation; accessibility |

- Dates `DD-MMM-YYYY`; balances with one-decimal precision; INR with locale formatting.
- WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, focus order, contrast, ARIA on calendars/grids.
- Toasts for action results; modals for destructive (cancel, year-close commit) with explicit confirmation.
- All list/grid views paginated (max 100) with filters and CSV export where applicable.
- i18n-ready (English + regional language); no hardcoded strings.

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data migration
| Step | Source | Target | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Leave types & policies | Legacy registers / rules | leave_types, leave_accrual_policies | Statutory caps verified |
| Opening leave balances | Legacy ledgers/spreadsheets | leave_balance_ledger (OPENING) + leave_balances | Reconciliation = 0 mismatch |
| Holiday calendars | Office circulars | holiday_calendars/holidays | Per-location completeness |
| Roster/shift assignments | HR records | shifts/rosters | No overlaps |
| Devices | IT inventory | attendance_devices | Geofence configured |
| Historical attendance (optional) | Biometric exports | attendance_punches/daily | Spot reconciliation |

### 13.2 Cutover & rollout
- Phased: configuration (types/policies/holidays/shifts) → balance migration with reconciliation sign-off → device integration → pilot org unit → org-wide.
- Parallel run for one leave cycle and one payroll cycle before decommissioning legacy.
- Go/No-Go gate: 0 reconciliation mismatches; SR posting and payroll feed validated end-to-end.

### 13.3 Rollback
- Migration executed in reversible batches; ledger OPENING entries tagged with migration run id for clean reversal; feature flags per FR.

### 13.4 Launch readiness checklist
Balances reconciled; policies signed off by HR/legal; SR (M04) and payroll (M10) handshakes tested; notifications verified; RBAC scopes validated; accessibility audit passed; runbooks and on-call in place.
