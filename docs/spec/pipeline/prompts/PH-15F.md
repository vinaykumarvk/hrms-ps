/goal
  objective: Close two named statutory gaps in one wave. PS09 (per the coverage delta
    docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md: "POSH/ICC, personal hearings, SLA pause"): implement the
    FR-PS09-023 POSH route — HARASSMENT cases resolve the ICC template, set inquiry_route=ICC_POSH, and ICC
    constitution enforces composition (presiding officer + at least one ICC_EXTERNAL_MEMBER); missing composition
    throws ERR-PS09-ICC-PROCEDURE-REQUIRED. FR-PS09-025 personal_hearings for SHOW_CAUSE/APPEAL stages — request
    recorded, authority grants or denies, denial without a denial_reason throws ERR-PS09-PERSONAL-HEARING-DENIED
    (422). FR-PS09-024 sla_pause_events — a pause records stage/reason/paused_from, no breach is raised while
    paused, resume sets resumed_at and recomputes sla_target_at/expected_closure_date by adding the paused
    duration; resume without an open pause throws ERR-PS09-SLA-PAUSE-INVALID (409). PS06 (delta: "rota-quota
    multi-stream"): implement FR-PPP-020 — seniority_quota_rules (DR/promotee/LDCE ratios, rotation_method,
    rotation_start_slot, unfilled carry-forward) drive deterministic multi-stream combined seniority construction;
    each entry records quota_slot_label and rotation_cycle_no and a rotation trace is retrievable; a population
    entry missing its stream tag fails with STREAM_TAG_MISSING and an invalid ratio/method with QUOTA_RULE_INVALID.

  constraints:
    - ICC composition is validated at constitution time against the appointment roles: a POSH case without a
      presiding officer and at least one external member cannot proceed to inquiry — thrown as
      error.code === 'ERR-PS09-ICC-PROCEDURE-REQUIRED', fail closed.
    - Personal-hearing denial requires a recorded denial_reason; deny-without-reason throws
      error.code === 'ERR-PS09-PERSONAL-HEARING-DENIED'; grant records schedule/minutes and the referencing
      show-cause/appeal carries personal_hearing_id.
    - sla_pause_events are append-only: resume writes resumed_at on the open pause (never deletes); the paused
      duration is added to the stage targets on resume (recompute asserted numerically in a test); overlapping
      pauses coalesce for breach evaluation; pause/resume land on the hash-chained case timeline.
    - Rota-quota construction is deterministic: the same population + quota rule yields the same interleave,
      slot labels, and cycle numbers on recompute (deep-equal); unfilled slots carry forward, never silently lost.
    - STREAM_TAG_MISSING and QUOTA_RULE_INVALID are thrown as error.code values from the construction/rule paths.
    - Parameterised queries only; transactions around multi-step writes; no console.log; no stack traces in responses.
    - Do NOT weaken any oracle under docs/spec/pipeline/checks/**; do NOT touch phases.yaml, .state/, or approvals/.

  escalate_when:
    - POSH composition/timeline parameters lack a grounded template source (do not invent statutory members/days).
    - The rota-quota worked vector (Appendix D.4) is not reproducible from the BRD tables (surface the ambiguity;
      do not tune the engine to a guessed vector).
    - SLA recompute interacts with an existing case-timeline invariant from PH-08E (surface the conflict; do not
      relax the hash-chain).
