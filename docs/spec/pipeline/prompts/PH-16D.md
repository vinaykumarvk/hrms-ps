  objective: Build PS05 vacancy lifecycle, transfer counselling, and mutual-transfer pairing at BRD depth. The
    tranche-2 verdict (docs/spec/ph-15-verdict.md) and the coverage delta
    (docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md) name PS05 "counselling, vacancy lifecycle, mutual transfer"
    as still NOT_FOUND. Implement per FR-PS05-003 and BRD rule 6: `vacancy_positions` published with a
    strength READ-THROUGH from the PH-08A sanctioned-posts kernel (PS05 is never authoritative for strength),
    `transfer_preferences` capturing ranked choices, and `vacancy_reservations` carrying the lifecycle
    RESERVED -> VACATED_ON_RELIEF -> FILLED_ON_JOIN; allotment requires vacant_count > 0 with a transactional
    re-check — double-fill throws ERR-PS05-VACANCY-FULL (409). Per FR-PS05-019: an interactive counselling turn
    engine — `counselling_sessions` with a turn order (SENIORITY/MERIT, ties broken by service_no) and
    `current_turn_employee_id` holding the vacancy lock; only the current-turn candidate may choose
    (ERR-PS05-COUNSEL-TURN, 409); every choice (CHOSEN/PASSED/DECLINED/AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT/ABSENT) is an
    immutable append-only `counselling_choices` row; a CHOSEN vacancy converts to a RESERVED reservation; a
    turn times out to AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT per turn_timeout_seconds (JOB-PS05-COUNSEL-TIMEOUT semantics). Per BRD
    rule 5: a MUTUAL request requires a reciprocal request (mutual_counterpart_employee_id); both orders are
    approved/published atomically as a coupled pair posting the frozen PS12 catalog SR code MUTUAL_TRANSFER;
    asymmetric completion throws ERR-PS05-MUTUAL-PAIR (409).

  constraints:
    - Strength is a read-through: vacancy_positions derives vacant_count from the PH-08A sanctioned-posts
      kernel; PS05 never mutates a local strength counter as truth (BRD 5.2.7). Allotment re-checks
      vacant_count transactionally at reservation time; over-allotment throws
      error.code === 'ERR-PS05-VACANCY-FULL' (409), fail closed.
    - counselling_choices is an append-only ledger: INSERT only, never UPDATE/DELETE; each row carries the
      choice, timestamp, turn_position, and recording officer; one live turn at a time — a choice by anyone
      other than current_turn_employee_id throws error.code === 'ERR-PS05-COUNSEL-TURN' (409).
    - Turn timeout records AUTO_PASS_TIMEOUT and advances the turn (JOB-PS05-COUNSEL-TIMEOUT semantics —
      injectable clock acceptable; do not busy-wait in tests).
    - Mutual coupling is atomic: pairing validates the reciprocal request; publish/approve applies to both
      coupled orders in one transaction; the SR posting uses the frozen catalog code MUTUAL_TRANSFER verbatim;
      asymmetric progression throws error.code === 'ERR-PS05-MUTUAL-PAIR' (409).
    - Parameterised queries only; transactions around multi-step writes; no console.log; no stack traces in
      responses; no hardcoded secrets.
    - Do NOT weaken any oracle under docs/spec/pipeline/checks/**; do NOT touch phases.yaml, .state/, or approvals/.

  escalate_when:
    - A turn-timeout default or tie-break rule has no grounded source in BRD/DDL/module config beyond the
      BRD's service_no tie-break (do not invent policy numbers).
    - The PH-08A sanctioned-posts kernel does not expose the read-through needed for vacant_count — record
      the dependency; do not duplicate strength as a PS05-owned counter.
    - The frozen PS12 SR catalog rejects MUTUAL_TRANSFER (surface the catalog conflict; do not mint a variant
      event code).
