# PH-64 (Remediation Tranche 51) — Human-Gate Verdict

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Chains from:** `docs/spec/ph-63-verdict.md` (tranche 50)
**Baseline:** `docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md`
**Branch:** ph02-rerun (merged to main per sub-phase)

## Suite evidence (oracle-recomputed)

- API `npm test`: **572 pass**, 0 fail, 1 skipped (DATABASE_URL-gated PH-06 persistence test).
- Web `npm run web:test`: **133 pass**, 0 fail.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run web:typecheck`: green.

The PH-64A oracle (and the PH-37A gate at its raised floor) were run **externally** by the driver and are
GREEN. Third net-new tranche. Built by hand — subagents credit-exhausted until 2026-07-08.

> **GREEN here is necessary, not sufficient.** Human review required before advancing.

## What tranche 51 closed — a NET-NEW contracted feature (not a wiring)

| Module | Net-new operation cluster | Backing | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PS01** | FR-EPM-006 education register (`GET/POST /employees/{id}/education`, `PATCH /employees/{id}/education/{educationId}`, `POST .../{educationId}:remove`) | **new** `EducationService` + `InMemoryEducationRepository` (built this tranche): single-highest invariant with auto-demotion (at most one ACTIVE is_highest per employee), year-of-passing validation (1950–2100), row_version optimistic locking (409), soft-delete that clears is_highest, per-mutation audit | `ph64a-ps01-education-route.test.cjs` |

Genuinely new implementation — a new service module + repository with real, tested business logic (promoting
a record auto-demotes the prior highest; optimistic lock; soft-delete). Measured contract coverage ratchets
**560 / 42.3% → 564 / 42.6%** (PS01 **35.2% → 37.6%**), and the PH-37 gate floor was raised in lockstep so the
gain is locked.

## Remaining gaps (still open — this is NOT a 100% claim)

- **Contract coverage is 42.6%** — ~759 of the **1,323** contracted operations remain unimplemented. Every
  ratchet from here is a **net-new implementation** (new backing + tests per operation). Next candidates: the
  remaining FR-EPM satellites (experience, bank accounts, positions/assignments, education-details) and
  equivalent net-new clusters in every module.
- **Persistence workstream:** the hand-built services (PH-16F..PH-64 engines, now including the nominee,
  emergency-contact, and education registers) use in-memory repositories; Postgres-backed repos + migrations
  remain deferred; the `ph06-persistence` migration list froze at 0008.

**Contract-op caveat (quantified):** the OpenAPI contract enumerates **1,323** operations; **564** are
implemented as behavioral kernel routes (**42.6%**).

## Recommendation for the human reviewer

Approve PH-64B, OR direct a further tranche (PH-65). The net-new implementation workstream continues; each
tranche adds a real contracted feature (new backing + tests), and the ratchet gate proves and locks every
gain. Carried debt is unchanged: in-memory repositories for the newest services.
