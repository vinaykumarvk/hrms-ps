# PS02 — Personal Details Modification Workflow — Acceptance & E2E Test Suite

## 1. Header

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | PS02-EPDM — Personal Details Modification Workflow (v3.0, platform-grounded) |
| Scope | Full change-request lifecycle for governed PS01/M01 fields: authoring, sensitivity routing, step-up, evidence & authority-portal, maker-checker approval, e-signature, diff, SLA/escalation, effective-dated commit, PS01→PS12 SR posting-status tracking, bulk corrections, data-subject notice/objection, employment-status gating, fraud signals, break-glass reversal, retro-impact reconciliation, config/delegation/templates, tamper-evident audit. |
| Grounding | BRD `docs/brd/v3/PS02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md` (FR-PS02-001…023, §5.5 sensitivity seed, §5.6 data-integrity rules); `docs/contracts/openapi/PS02.yaml`; `docs/contracts/error-taxonomy.yaml` (ERR-PS02-*); `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml` (PS02 `change_request`); `docs/contracts/auth-matrix.yaml` (PS02 actions/roles/SoD). |
| Critical model under test | **PS02 is NOT a Digital-SR writer.** On commit of a STATUTORY change, **PS01** (master/identity owner, `source_module=PS01`) posts the SR event to PS12; PS02 only supplies context and tracks `sr_posting_status`. SR/retro tracking is separate and never gates `COMMITTED` (§5.6 rule 11). |
| Traceability | Every TC carries `Traces-to` (FR + AC/BR). Matrix in §3; every FR has ≥1 TC (0 gaps). |
| Out of scope (asserted, not exercised) | PS01/M01 field storage & SR-event write (PS01); PS12 ledger internals; PS13 binary storage; PS10/PS11/PS06 recompute execution; platform MFA/step-up challenge internals (invoked only). |

### Test-environment & data assumptions

- **Multi-tenant.** All rows carry `tenant_id`/`entity_id`. Baseline tenant `tn-enterprise`, entities `en-fin` and `en-edu`. An unscoped query is **rejected, not defaulted to all** (Platform §0.1). Cross-tenant read returns `404 NOT_FOUND` (never leaks existence).
- **API conventions.** Base `/api/v1`; bearer JWT carries resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; `Idempotency-Key` header required on state-changing POSTs (24h replay); `X-Correlation-Id` echoed in every response header; cursor pagination (`limit` default 25 / max 100, `next_cursor`). Canonical error envelope `{ "error": { "code", "message", "field", "details" } }`; correlation id is a **header**, never a body field.
- **Personas.**
  - `emp-alice` (role `employee`, own-record scope, entity `en-fin`) — self-service requester/data-subject.
  - `emp-bob` (role `employee`, entity `en-fin`) — second data subject (mule detection).
  - `mgr-mohan` (role `l1_manager`, Alice's reporting chain) — recommender / LOW-MEDIUM approver.
  - `hr-hema` (role `hrbp`, entity `en-fin`) — reviewer/checker, bulk-correction maker.
  - `hradm-raj` (role `hr_admin`, entity `en-fin`) — HIGH approver, bulk approver, break-glass auth1, SR retry.
  - `aa-anand` (role `appointing_authority`, entity `en-fin`, MFA) — STATUTORY sanction, break-glass auth2.
  - `fraud-fiona` (`hrbp` + `fraud_reviewer` flag) — fraud queue.
  - `griev-gita` (`hr_admin` + `grievance_officer` flag) — objection handling.
  - `srcust-sam` (role `sr_custodian`, entity `en-fin`) — SR reconciliation view/retry.
  - `aud-amit` (Auditor = Org-Admin read + read-only entitlement + P05 `Audit.query`).
  - `sysadm-sara` (role `org_admin`) — W.1/W.2 config; **no transactional self-approval**.
- **Sensitivity seed (§5.5, illustrative/configurable).** `correspondence_address`=LOW; `email`/`primary_phone`/`alternate_phone`=MEDIUM + `is_auth_bearing=true`; `permanent_address`/`marital_status`=MEDIUM; `qualification`=HIGH (OTP+); `bank_account_no`=HIGH, `E·AR`, e-sign PKI_DSC/AADHAAR_ESIGN; `first_name`/`middle_name`/`last_name`/`dob`/`gender`=STATUTORY; `national_id`(Aadhaar)/`pan`/`category`=STATUTORY, `E·AR`, HR-only, authority-portal, `post_to_sr=true`. `dob` carries `hard_block_rule_ref=DOB_PRE_RETIREMENT_BAR` (barred within 5 yrs of superannuation).
- **Fixtures.** `emp-alice` ACTIVE, DOJ 2015-06-01, DOB 1968-01-01 (>5 yrs to superannuation), primary bank `ACC-1111`. `emp-carol` RETIRED. `emp-dan` DECEASED. `emp-eric` ACTIVE, DOB 1966-05-01 (within 5-yr pre-retirement bar). Config: FINANCIAL objection window 48h; step-up validity 10 min; matrix active for `en-fin`.
- **Priority scale.** P1 = statutory/security/data-integrity critical; P2 = core functional; P3 = secondary/UX/report.

| Expected | `retro_impact_events` row `PENDING` after `COMMITTED` (never gates commit); idempotent on `item_id + ':RETRO:' + module`; on ACK → `ACKED`. |
| Priority | P1 |

| TC | TC-PS02-085 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-022; API-contract `GET /reports/retro-reconciliation` |
| Type | API-Contract / Negative |
| Title | Unacked / dead-letter retro events surface in the reconciliation report and retry |
| Preconditions | retro event unacked past threshold |
| Steps | `GET /reports/retro-reconciliation`. |
| Expected | `200` cursor list including the unacked event; X.1 retry/backoff; never dropped. |

### FR-PS02-023 — Requester step-up authentication

| TC | TC-PS02-086 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-023 AC1/AC3; `ERR-PS02-STEPUP`; state `DRAFT→SUBMITTED` guard |
| Type | Negative / State-Transition |
| Title | Submitting a HIGH/STATUTORY self-service request without valid step-up is blocked |
| Preconditions | `emp-alice` draft on `bank_account_no` (HIGH); no step-up captured |
| Steps | `POST /change-requests/{id}/submit`. |
| Expected | `412 PRECONDITION_FAILED` code `ERR-PS02-STEPUP`; request stays `DRAFT`. |
| Priority | P1 |

| TC | TC-PS02-087 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-023 AC2/BR1; API-contract challenge/verify |
| Type | E2E-Flow |
| Title | Successful step-up (AAL2) binds to the request and permits submit within validity |
| Preconditions | `emp-alice` HIGH draft |
| Steps | 1. `POST /change-requests/{id}/step-up/challenge`. 2. `POST .../step-up/verify` success. 3. `POST .../submit`. |
| Expected | 2. `cr_step_up_events.SUCCESS` with `auth_assurance_level=AAL2`, `expires_at`=+10 min. 3. `200` `SUBMITTED`. |
| Priority | P1 |

| TC | TC-PS02-088 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-023 AC3 Edge (expiry); AC4 (failed recorded) |
| Type | Boundary / Negative |
| Title | Expired step-up forces re-challenge; failed step-ups recorded and block submit |
| Preconditions | step-up SUCCESS older than 10-min window; and a separate FAILED attempt |
| Steps | 1. submit with expired step-up. 2. submit after a FAILED step-up. |
| Expected | 1. `412 ERR-PS02-STEPUP` (re-challenge). 2. `412`; failed attempt recorded to P05 `security_audit_log`. |
| Priority | P2 |

| TC | TC-PS02-089 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-023 BR2 (HR-on-behalf skips step-up) |
| Type | Functional |
| Title | HR-on-behalf path does not require step-up (uses data-subject notice instead) |
| Preconditions | `hr-hema` HR_ON_BEHALF HIGH change |
| Steps | Submit without step-up. |
| Expected | No `ERR-PS02-STEPUP`; routes via NOTICE_HOLD + data-subject notice (FR-017). |
| Priority | P2 |

### Cross-cutting — multi-tenancy, contract envelope

| TC | TC-PS02-090 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | §2.2 multi-tenant scoping (Platform §0.1); error-taxonomy scope-safety |
| Type | Authorization / Data-Integrity |
| Title | Cross-tenant read returns 404 without leaking existence |
| Preconditions | request `CR-x` belongs to tenant `tn-other` |
| Steps | `hradm-raj` (`tn-enterprise`) `GET /change-requests/CR-x`. |
| Expected | `404 NOT_FOUND` (indistinguishable from absent); no cross-tenant leak; unscoped query rejected, not defaulted to all. |
| Priority | P1 |

| TC | TC-PS02-091 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | §4.1 API conventions; error-taxonomy envelope |
| Type | API-Contract |
| Title | Unauthenticated request returns 401 and canonical envelope with X-Correlation-Id header |
| Preconditions | no/expired bearer token |
| Steps | `POST /change-requests` without token. |
| Expected | `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`; body `{error:{code,message,field,details}}`; correlation id in **header**, not body. |
| Priority | P2 |

| TC | TC-PS02-092 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | §4.1 Idempotency-Key on unsafe POSTs |
| Type | Data-Integrity |
| Title | Replayed submit with same Idempotency-Key returns original result, not a duplicate |
| Preconditions | submit already succeeded with `Idempotency-Key: sk-9` |
| Steps | Re-POST submit with `sk-9` within 24h. |
| Expected | Original `200` result returned; no duplicate workflow instance (`ERR-DUP-INSTANCE` only for a genuine second open change). |
| Priority | P1 |

### FR-PS02-012 (v3.2) — PII-tier classification on the field-sensitivity catalog

| TC | TC-PS02-093 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-012; v3.2 recon R3.2-1; §5.2 E5 `field_sensitivity_catalog.pii_tier_id` |
| Type | Functional / API-Contract |
| Title | Org-Admin sets a field's DPDPA PII tier on the sensitivity-catalog entry |
| Preconditions | `sysadm-sara` (Org-Admin); platform `pii_tiers` seeded (TIER_1/TIER_2/TIER_3/NON_PII) |
| Steps | `POST /admin/field-sensitivity` `{ fieldKey:"bank_account_no", sensitivity:"FINANCIAL", piiTierId:"<TIER_1 uuid>" }`; then `GET /admin/field-sensitivity`. |
| Expected | `201`/`200`; entry persists `piiTierId` and round-trips it on read; FK to platform `pii_tiers` honoured (unknown id → `422 VALIDATION_FAILED`; `ON DELETE RESTRICT` blocks tier deletion while referenced). |
| Priority | P2 |

| TC | TC-PS02-094 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-012; FR-PS02-002; v3.2 recon note (PII tier vs routing sensitivity — orthogonality) |
| Type | Data-Integrity / Negative |
| Title | PII tier is orthogonal to approval routing — changing `piiTierId` does not alter the P01 route |
| Preconditions | Catalog entry for `bank_account_no` (`sensitivity=FINANCIAL`); route resolved via `approval_matrix_rules` |
| Steps | Capture `POST /change-requests/{id}/route-preview`; `PATCH /admin/field-sensitivity` to change only `piiTierId` (FINANCIAL sensitivity unchanged); re-run route-preview on an equivalent request. |
| Expected | `routePreview` / `highestSensitivity` are identical before and after; P01 route stays derived from `sensitivity`/`fieldGroup`/`fieldKey` only; `piiTierId` never appears in route resolution. |
| Priority | P1 |

| TC | TC-PS02-095 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-012; FR-M01-003 prototype `sensitive-changes` screen; v3.2 recon R3.2-1 |
| Type | Functional / API-Contract |
| Title | A Tier-1 field surfaces correctly under the sensitive-changes PII-tier grouping |
| Preconditions | `bank_account_no` classified `piiTierId=TIER_1`; a committed/in-review change request touches it |
| Steps | Read the field-sensitivity catalog (and the request diff) that the `sensitive-changes` review screen consumes. |
| Expected | The field resolves to PII Tier 1 and groups under "PII Tier 1" (distinct from Tier 2); grouping is driven by `piiTierId`, independent of the `sensitivity` value the routing uses. |
| Priority | P2 |

| TC | TC-PS02-096 |
|---|---|
| Traces-to | FR-PS02-012; v3.2 recon (add-only, nullable FK) |
| Type | Boundary |
| Title | `piiTierId` is optional — a NON_PII / unclassified field is accepted and not grouped as sensitive |
| Preconditions | `sysadm-sara`; a low-sensitivity field (e.g. `preferred_name`) |
| Steps | `POST /admin/field-sensitivity` with `piiTierId` omitted (null), then optionally set to the `NON_PII` tier. |
| Expected | Entry accepted with `piiTierId=null` (add-only nullable column, no forced default); such fields do not surface under any "PII Tier N" sensitive-changes group. |
| Priority | P3 |
