# Retirement and Pension Management — HRMS Module BRD (v2.0)

**Module code:** M11-PEN
**Program:** Enterprise HRMS ("PeopleGov / HRMS Suite") — Enterprise / Public-Sector context
**Authoring standard:** World-class global HCM (Workday / SAP SuccessFactors / Oracle HCM bar) honouring Indian public-sector statutory pension rules (CCS Pension Rules-style framework, NPS, **UPS (eff. 01-Apr-2025)**, GPF, Jeevan Pramaan/DLC, DoPPW *Bhavishya*/DigiLocker benchmarks)
**Source of truth:** `docs/brd/SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` (canonical shared entities, conventions, RBAC, technical defaults). This BRD references and extends — it does not redefine — those shared elements.
**Document version:** v2.0 (supersedes v1.0)
**Status:** Revised for Gate A re-review — incorporates the adopted improvements from the Adversarial Council Report (`docs/evaluation/M11-retirement-and-pension-council.md`, 2026-06-30)
**Revision basis:** Conditional-GO council verdict. Seven Critical findings (R1–R7) and eleven High/Medium/Low findings (R8–R18) plus three world-class additions are incorporated as concrete requirements, entities, fields, rules, states, and controls. The sound v1 spine (determinism + `calc_trace` + `rule_version_ref`, immutability-by-supersession, SoD, no-break anticipatory engineering, full pensioner lifecycle) is preserved unchanged.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Retirement and Pension Management module (**M11-PEN**) governs the complete lifecycle of an employee's separation from service and the lifelong administration of their pensionary and terminal benefits. It manages every **separation type** (superannuation/age retirement, voluntary retirement (VRS), compulsory retirement ordered under disciplinary proceedings, invalidation/medical retirement, death-in-service, and resignation); computes **qualifying service** (now including structured **counted prior/military service**) and the full benefit set (basic pension, **service gratuity for <10-year service**, commutation, family/enhanced family pension, retirement and death gratuity, leave encashment, GPF final withdrawal) **net of statutory tax/TDS**; generates the statutory **Pension Payment Order (PPO)** including **provisional PPOs for pending proceedings (Rule 9)**; and maintains the **pensioner master** and pensioner lifecycle (life-certificate/Jeevan Pramaan, restoration of commuted portion, conversion to family pension on a pensioner's death, **proactive death-detection and overpayment recovery**, and pension revision on DA or pay-commission changes under a **deterministic revision-application order**).

M11 is engineered as a **rule-driven, audit-grade benefit engine** that is deterministic and reproducible **on top of a rigorous input-provenance gate**. Benefits are never hand-keyed; they are *derived* from verified service history in the **Digital Service Register (M12)**, last-pay-drawn and contribution history from **Payroll (M10)**, leave balances from **M03**, and disciplinary orders from **M09**, evaluated against **first-class, effective-dated, versioned pension rule-table entities** (DA/Dearness-Relief rates, commutation factors, family-pension rates, gratuity ceilings with the DA-linked auto-step, retirement ages, minimum/maximum pension, rounding). Crucially, computation is **gated by an e-SR completeness & discrepancy-resolution stage** (per-spell reason-code attestation, condonation register, multi-point sign-off) so that determinism defends correct numbers rather than amplifying upstream defects. Once a benefit case is **sanctioned and a PPO is issued, the calculation snapshot is immutable** — corrections flow only through controlled revision/re-issue with full audit. Every rupee of pension is traceable from qualifying-service input through PPO to disbursement, and every audit objection is tracked to closure.

### 1.2 Business Context and Problem Statement

Public-sector retirement processing is high-stakes, statutorily intricate, and time-critical: an employee who superannuates on the last day of a month must receive pension from the next day without a break. Processing combines **service-record verification** (gap-free service from joining to retirement), **qualifying-service arithmetic** (deducting non-qualifying spells such as extraordinary leave without pay, dies-non, and unauthorised absence, and *adding* counted prior service), **three pension regimes** — **Old Pension Scheme (OPS)** for pre-cutoff entrants, **National Pension System (NPS)** for later entrants (with the **CCS (Implementation of NPS) Rules 2021** death/invalidation default benefit), and the **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)** assured payout for opted-in employees — **commutation actuarial factors**, **family-pension rules** (normal vs enhanced rates with *path-specific* eligibility windows), **gratuity ceilings**, **tax/TDS treatment** of terminal benefits, and **DA/pay-commission revisions** applied to a live pensioner population for decades, sometimes by **bank CPPCs that themselves apply Dearness Relief**. Manual processing produces delayed first pensions, miscalculated benefits, audit objections, litigation, pension drawn into deceased pensioners' accounts, and hardship to bereaved families. M11 eliminates these by making the rule set explicit and versioned, the computation reproducible and traceable **only after the input is proven complete**, the workflow gated by service verification and no-dues, the disbursement model explicit per PDA, fraud caught proactively, and the pensioner lifecycle fully digital — with a **plain-language citizen layer** over the statutory core.

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives

| # | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Zero break in pension | First pension/anticipatory/provisional pension authorised on/before the day after retirement for 100% of cases |
| G2 | Deterministic, reproducible benefit computation | Re-running a case **with the snapshotted rule version and the same verified inputs** yields identical benefit figures and trace. *External/indicative NPS-CRA and UPS-annuity figures are explicitly excluded from the determinism guarantee.* |
| G3 | Statutory accuracy | 100% correct qualifying-service, pension (flat 50% ≥10 yrs / service gratuity <10 yrs), commutation, gratuity, *path-specific* family-pension, UPS/NPS-default, and tax computation against published rules |
| G4 | Service-verified eligibility | No CALCULATION without a **signed-off service-verification record** (discrepancy ledger closed, spells attested); no PPO without M12 SR verification complete and no-dues cleared |
| G5 | Digital, self-service retirement | Retiring employee tracks case via a **3-state plain-language tracker**, runs **outcome-framed estimators**, and submits forms online; pensioner submits Digital Life Certificate online and receives the e-PPO in **DigiLocker** |
| G6 | Lifelong pensioner integrity | Correct DA/pay-commission revision under a **deterministic application order**, commuted-portion restoration on the **reduction-date+15yr** schedule, family-pension conversion, and proactive death/fraud control across the pensioner's life |
| G7 | Forecasting & liability transparency | Accurate due-for-retirement forecasts and pension-liability analytics by org unit, cadre, and horizon |
| G8 | Audit-objection closure (new) | 100% of AG/internal-audit objections tracked from raise to closure with linkage to the case and `calc_trace` |

### 1.4 Scope Summary

In scope: retirement forecasting & due-for-retirement lists; separation-case management for all separation types; **e-SR completeness & discrepancy-resolution gate**; pre-retirement processing (1–2 years ahead: SR verification with M12, no-dues clearance, anticipatory pension); **provisional pension for pending proceedings (Rule 9)**; qualifying-service computation with non-qualifying-spell deduction **and counted prior-service addition**; pension calculation (basic OPS flat-rate / **service gratuity** / **NPS death-default** / **UPS assured payout**); commutation **with explicit reduction/restoration timing**; retirement, death **and service** gratuity (ceiling **auto-stepping on DA milestones**); **path-specific** family & enhanced family pension driven by a **statutory family-members register** (with **dual family pension and twin/multiple-children** support); terminal benefits & final settlement (incl. leave encashment from M03, GPF final withdrawal) **with tax/TDS and Section 89(1) relief**; PPO generation (incl. digital PPO, **DigiLocker delivery**); pensioner master & lifecycle (life certificate/Jeevan Pramaan, restoration, family-pension conversion); **proactive death-detection (death-registry/Aadhaar-DBT reconciliation) and overpayment recovery from estate**; pension revision on DA/pay-commission under a **deterministic ordering rule** and an explicit **paymaster-vs-authoriser disbursement model**; treasury/bank/PDA integration with a **defined interface contract and pre-credit penny-drop verification**; retirement self-service portal & **outcome-framed estimators/what-if**; pensioner grievance management; **audit-objection management**; **effective-dated rule-table management**; and forecasting & pension-liability analytics.

Out of scope (owned elsewhere): the canonical employee master (M01); the SR ledger itself (M12) — M11 reads/verifies and appends retirement events; payroll computation of in-service salary and the monthly active-employee payslip (M10) — M11 consumes last-pay-drawn and contribution history; leave capture and encashable-balance maintenance (M03); disciplinary adjudication that issues a compulsory-retirement penalty order or recovery (M09) — M11 consumes the order; document storage internals (M13); and core banking/treasury ledger posting beyond producing and reconciling the disbursement file and (where the PDA is a CPPC) the Dearness-Relief application that the bank performs.

### 1.5 Key Stakeholders

Retiring Employee / Pensioner / Family Pensioner (self-service), Pension Officer/Dealing Assistant (maker), Pension Sanctioning Authority / Head of Office (checker), HR Officer/Admin, SR Custodian/Registrar (M12), Payroll Officer (M10 last-pay & contributions), Department Head / Appointing Authority, Treasury / Pension Disbursing Authority (PDA) / Bank CPPC, Medical Board (invalidation), **Auditor / AG (audit objections)**, **Disciplinary Authority (M09, provisional-pension linkage)**, System Administrator (rule tables).

### 1.6 Success Criteria

A retirement case is "successful" when: the separation is recorded with the correct type and date; **service verification is signed off with the discrepancy ledger closed and every non-qualifying spell reason-code-attested**; no-dues is cleared; qualifying service (including counted prior service) and all benefits — under the correct OPS/NPS/UPS regime, with service gratuity where service <10 yrs, path-specific family pension, and tax/TDS — are computed deterministically against a snapshotted rule version with full trace and sanctioned by an authority distinct from the maker; the PPO (and where applicable anticipatory **or provisional** pension) is issued before pension commencement; terminal benefits and GPF are settled net of tax; the pensioner is enrolled in the pensioner master; the disbursement instruction passes **pre-credit account verification** and is accepted by the PDA/bank under the recorded disbursement model; and a retirement event is appended to M12 — all with a complete, immutable audit trail and any audit objection tracked to closure.

### 3.2 Common Capabilities (inherited from Shared Foundation)

All M11 features inherit: UUID PKs + human business keys; standard audit fields; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE status enums; UTC storage / locale display; `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates; INR default currency with i18n money formatting; paginated list endpoints (max page 100); maker-checker via the shared workflow engine; RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; immutable `audit_log` write on every state change; `documents` (M13) for generated artefacts (PPO, sanction orders, calculation sheets); `notifications` for events; `service_register_events` (M12) for retirement/separation events.

### 3.3 In-Scope / Out-of-Scope Boundary Table

| Concern | In M11? | Owner / Note |
|---|---|---|
| Employee master data | Reference only | M01 (golden source) |
| Service history / SR ledger | Verify, **reconcile discrepancies** & append | M12 owns ledger; M11 runs the completeness/discrepancy gate (FR-18) and appends retirement events |
| Last-pay-drawn & contribution history | Consume only | M10 supplies emoluments base, GPF/NPS contributions |
| Leave encashable balance | Consume only | M03 supplies encashable EL balance; M11 computes encashment amount |
| Compulsory-retirement penalty order | Consume the order | M09 adjudicates; M11 processes the resulting separation |
| Pending departmental/judicial proceedings | **Consume status; drive provisional pension** | M09 supplies proceedings status; M11 issues provisional pension & withholds DCRG (FR-22) |
| Disciplinary recovery against benefits | Consume; net from settlement | M09 issues recovery; M11 nets within statutory protection |
| Active-employee payroll run | Out | M10 (M11 begins at separation/retirement) |
| Pension monthly disbursement & **Dearness-Relief application** | Instruction + reconcile; **DR by M11 or by PDA per model** | PDA/Treasury/Bank disburse; where PDA is a CPPC it applies DR (FR-21 model) |
| Document storage internals | Reference | M13 stores PPO/sanction/calc-sheet objects |
| Medical fitness adjudication | Consume verdict | Medical Board issues invalidation certificate; M11 records & uses it |
| Income-tax assessment | Compute TDS at source only | M11 computes exemptions/TDS/89(1) relief on terminal benefits; final assessment is the tax authority's |
| Death-registry / Aadhaar-DBT signals | **Reconcile** | M11 ingests death/payment signals to detect post-death drawals (FR-20) |

### 3.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- Pension/commutation/gratuity rules, DA rates for pensioners, commutation factors by age, family-pension rates, and gratuity ceilings are **first-class, effective-dated rule-table entities** (E30–E36), version-controlled and approved (FR-19), sourced from enterprise notifications. `rule_version_ref` is a **foreign key** to a concrete rule-version row, not free text.
- The OPS/NPS/UPS cutover dates (date-of-joining boundaries and the UPS opt-in window) are configurable; scheme is derived from `employees.date_of_joining` and recorded contribution history, overridable with justification and audit. **UPS** applies to opted-in NPS employees from 01-Apr-2025.
- A single legal entity per deployment; the data model is entity-aware (`legal_entity_id`) for future multi-entity.
- All money math uses fixed-point decimal (`NUMERIC`); rounding rules per statutory prescription are explicit and configurable via E36 (`rounding_rules`).
- "Emoluments" / "average emoluments" base and the reckonable period are configurable policy parameters resolved per case and snapshotted. **UPS** uses the last-12-month average pay base.
- Digital Life Certificate integrates with a Jeevan Pramaan-style service; manual life-certificate capture (physical/video-KYC/bank-certified) is always available as a fallback.
- The **disbursement model is explicit per PDA** (FR-21): some PDAs are paid an exact computed amount (M11_COMPUTES_FULL); CPPC banks are sent the basic + relief formula and apply DR themselves (PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF). Determinism and batch sizing assumptions branch on this.
- Determinism is guaranteed **only after** the service-verification record is signed off (FR-18) and against the snapshotted rule version; external NPS-CRA/UPS-annuity figures are indicative and excluded from the guarantee.

---

## 4. Shared Application Foundation

M11 inherits the Shared Foundation §5 technical defaults verbatim: React + TypeScript (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) frontend; REST `/api/v1`; PostgreSQL primary store; encrypted object storage for PPOs/sanction orders/calculation sheets; OIDC/SSO + MFA; JWT + RBAC + org-unit row-level scoping; canonical error envelope; OWASP ASVS; TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest; DPDP Act 2023 alignment; P95 < 500ms (interactive), batch SLAs in §9; 99.9% uptime; WCAG 2.1 AA; RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h.

**M11-specific foundation extensions:**

- **Money type:** `NUMERIC(15,2)` for all benefit amounts; rates/factors as `NUMERIC(9,4)`; service durations as integer years/months/days; no floating point in computation.
- **Computation determinism (restated):** every benefit engine is a pure function of (**signed-off** verified service record, emoluments snapshot, scheme, **rule-version rows** effective on the relevant date, beneficiary/family data). Same inputs → same outputs **given the snapshotted rule version**; a `calc_trace` (JSONB) is persisted with each calculation. External NPS-CRA/UPS-annuity figures are indicative and outside the guarantee.
- **Input-provenance gate (new):** no benefit engine runs until the case has a `service_verifications` row in `SIGNED_OFF`/`LOCKED` status with its discrepancy ledger closed and every non-qualifying spell reason-code-attested (FR-18).
- **Immutability:** a sanctioned calculation and its issued PPO are append-only snapshots; corrections create a new revision linked to the original (no silent edit).
- **Idempotency:** all case-progression, PPO-issue, revision, disbursement, and **account-verification** mutating endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key` header.
- **Transactionality:** sanction, PPO issue, family-pension conversion, **revision-apply**, and **death-conversion** each commit as all-or-nothing transactions; multi-step settlement writes use transactions.
- **Encryption & PII:** bank account numbers, PAN/national_id/Aadhaar, nominee/family details, and benefit amounts are PII/financial data — encrypted at rest, masked in UI by default, access logged. Deceased-employee/family-pensioner data handled with heightened sensitivity. **Death-registry/DBT reconciliation data** is processed under DPDP purpose-limitation and retained only as needed for fraud control.
- **Determinism contract for concurrent events:** when multiple pensioner events share an effective date, the engine applies them in the mandatory order of §16.9 (pay-commission re-fixation → commuted-portion restoration → DA/Dearness-Relief → age-based additional pension).

### 5.4 Ownership / Reuse Matrix (delta)

Unchanged from v1 for E04–E21 and shared entities. New M11-owned entities E26–E42 are owned/written by M11, read by M14/Auditor; `pension_disbursing_authorities` and the rule tables (E30–E36) are written only by SysAdmin under approval (FR-19/FR-21) and read by every benefit engine. `family_members` is sourced from M01/employee Form-3/14 declarations but mastered in M11 for pension purposes.

### 5.6 Data Integrity Rules (changes/additions over v1)

- **IR2 (amended):** `net_qualifying = gross − Σ(uncondoned non-qualifying days) + Σ(counted prior-service days)`; condoned spells (via E29) count as qualifying.
- **IR2a (new):** A case cannot enter CALCULATION unless its `service_verifications` row is `SIGNED_OFF`/`LOCKED` with `discrepancy_open_count = 0` and `spells_attested_count = spells_total_count`.
- **IR3a (new):** If `qualifying_service_records.meets_min_pension_service = false` (net < min-service threshold E35), no `pension_calculations` FULL_PENSION row may exist; a `SERVICE_GRATUITY` `gratuity_calculations` row is mandatory instead.
- **IR4a (new):** `commutation_records.restoration_due_date = reduction_effective_date + statutory_period`; if `migrated_date_unknown = true`, restoration is flagged for manual review and not auto-applied.
- **IR8 (amended):** Family-pension eligibility and hierarchy derive from `family_members` (E26) by `statutory_rank`, never from `nominees_beneficiaries`. On a SELF_PENSIONER death, a `family_pension_records` (CONVERTED) row + FAMILY_PENSION PPO are created with `enhanced_basis = AFTER_RETIREMENT`.
- **IR8a (new):** Death-in-service family pension uses `enhanced_basis = IN_SERVICE` (10-yr window, no age cap); after-retirement conversion uses AFTER_RETIREMENT (7-yr/age-67 window). Windows are computed from E32, not hand-set.
- **IR14 (amended):** Sum of `nominees_beneficiaries.share_pct` per apportioned scope (GRATUITY/GPF/LEAVE_ENCASHMENT) = 100.00. For family pension, simultaneous twins/eligible children draw per `family_members.concurrent_share_pct` summing to 100.00; dual family pension is permitted subject to `family_pension_rates.dual_fp_cap_amount`.
- **IR15 (new):** A PROVISIONAL PPO requires `separation_cases.proceedings_pending = true` and `provisional_pension_records.dcrg_withheld = true`; DCRG is released or recovered only on `proceedings_concluded_on`.
- **IR16 (new):** No disbursement line for a FIRST_PENSION/TERMINAL/GRATUITY/GPF/COMMUTED_VALUE type to a given account may be TRANSMITTED unless a `bank_account_verifications` row for that account is `PASSED`.
- **IR17 (new):** `rule_version_ref` on every benefit calculation must point to a rule-version row whose status was EFFECTIVE on the relevant date; SUPERSEDED rows remain referenced by historic calcs (immutability).
- **IR18 (new):** When ≥2 revision events share an effective date for one pensioner, they are applied strictly in the §16.9 order; the `calc_trace` records the applied order.
- **IR19 (new):** A `pension_overpayment_recoveries` row in IDENTIFIED/NOTIFIED/UNDER_RECOVERY holds (does not delete) the pensioner's disbursement where rules require, and links to any family-pension conversion.
- All v1 IRs (IR1, IR5–IR7, IR9–IR13) carried forward unchanged.

## 6. Functional Requirements

> FRs marked **(enhanced)** carry v1 content forward with the adopted-improvement changes woven in (new ACs/BRs flagged). FRs FR-18–FR-24 are **(new)**. Every FR retains ID, Module, Primary Role(s), User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Business Rules, Data Model References, API References, UI Behavior Notes, Edge Cases, and full LLD table.

### FR-M11-01 — Retirement Forecasting & Due-for-Retirement Lists

- **Module:** M11-F01
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want an automatically refreshed list of employees due to retire by horizon so that processing can start 1–2 years ahead and no first pension is delayed.
- **Description:** Compute each active employee's projected superannuation date from `dob` + applicable retirement age (now resolved from the `retirement_age_rules` rule table E34), classify into horizon buckets, surface those due within 24/12/6 months, flag whether a case is already initiated, and drive proactive alerts and workload planning. Refreshed nightly and on-demand.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Projected retirement date = last day of the month in which the employee attains the configured superannuation age (per E34 cadre rule), recomputed on DOB/cadre change.
  - AC2: Lists filter by org unit, cadre, horizon bucket, and "case not yet initiated".
  - AC3: Employees crossing the 18-month threshold without a case trigger an alert to the responsible Pension Officer.
  - AC4: The forecast excludes employees already separated (RETIRED/DECEASED/RESIGNED/TERMINATED).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Retirement age resolved from E34 (effective-dated, by cadre/category). BR2: Forecast is read-only projection; never auto-creates a case. BR3: Mid-month attainment retires on month-end per policy.
- **Data Model References:** `retirement_forecasts`, `retirement_age_rules` (read), `employees` (read), `org_units` (read), `separation_cases` (case_initiated flag).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/forecasts` | due-for-retirement list (filters: horizon, org_unit, cadre) |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/forecasts:refresh` | recompute projections |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/forecasts/{employeeId}` | one employee's projection |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Due-for-retirement worklist with horizon tabs, per-row "initiate case" action, alert badges, export. Self-service shows the employee their own projected date.
- **Edge Cases:** DOB correction; cadre change altering retirement age (E34 lookup); extension-of-service order; deceased mid-horizon; leap-year/month-end arithmetic.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ForecastProjector`, `HorizonClassifier`, nightly scheduler, `AlertEmitter` |
| Backend Flow | For each active employee → resolve retirement age (E34) → compute superannuation date → bucket → upsert forecast → emit threshold alerts |
| Data Operations | Bulk upsert; index on `(horizon_bucket, org_unit_id)`, `projected_retirement_date` |
| Validation | DOB present; E34 rule resolved; exclude separated statuses |
| Authorization | Pension Officer/HR (org scope); employee reads own |
| State Changes & Side Effects | forecasts refreshed; threshold notifications |
| Failure Handling | Missing DOB → exception list; E34 unresolved → flagged UNRESOLVED |
| Dependencies | M01, E34 |
| Test Guidance | Month-end arithmetic; cadre ages from E34; DOB-change recompute; alert threshold; separated-exclusion |

### FR-M11-02 — Separation Case Management (All Separation Types) **(enhanced)**

- **Module:** M11-F02
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to create and drive a separation case for any separation type and pension regime so that the correct rules, workflow, and benefit set apply from the start.
- **Description:** Create a `separation_cases` record selecting the type, derive the pension scheme (**OPS/NPS/UPS**), capture type-specific inputs (VRS notice, M09 compulsory-retirement order ref, medical-board ref, death report ref, **pending-proceedings flag**), bind a **PDA (carrying its disbursement model)**, and progress through the state machine with maker-checker gates. Type drives which downstream FRs are mandatory (death-in-service → family pension + death gratuity; resignation → typically GPF/leave only; **pending proceedings → provisional pension path FR-22**).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each type enforces required inputs (COMPULSORY_RETIREMENT → valid M09 order; INVALIDATION → medical-board certificate; DEATH_IN_SERVICE → date of death + family-member data from E26).
  - AC2: Scheme (OPS/NPS/UPS) auto-derived from DOJ vs cutover and UPS opt-in; override requires reason + audit.
  - AC2a: **(new)** If `proceedings_pending = true`, the case is routed to the provisional-pension path (FR-22) and DCRG is flagged for full withholding.
  - AC3: Only an authority distinct from the maker can sanction (SoD).
  - AC4: Resignation/dismissal paths suppress pension where rules disallow it but still allow GPF/leave settlement.
  - AC5: At most one active case per employee (IR1).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Compulsory retirement initiated only from an M09 penalty order. BR2: Death-in-service auto-spawns family-pension (`enhanced_basis=IN_SERVICE`) and death-gratuity sub-flows. BR3: VRS requires minimum qualifying service and may add weightage. BR4: A case cannot skip the service-verification gate (FR-18) or no-dues except via explicit anticipatory/provisional exception. BR5: **(new)** UPS opt-in is recorded once and is irreversible per rule; scheme override audited.

### FR-M11-03 — Pre-Retirement Processing (SR Verification, No-Dues, Anticipatory Pension) **(enhanced)**

- **Module:** M11-F03
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, SR Custodian (M12), HR Admin, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to run SR verification, drive no-dues clearance, and authorise anticipatory pension 1–2 years ahead so that benefits are ready before the retirement date and pension never breaks.
- **Description:** Orchestrate the lead pipeline: trigger the **service-verification completeness gate (FR-18)** and request gap-free verification from M12 (SR Custodian certifies), coordinate no-dues clearance, and — when final pension cannot be sanctioned in time — authorise **anticipatory pension** within rule limits so the pensioner is paid from day one, later adjusted against the final sanction. (Pending-proceedings cases use provisional pension FR-22 instead of/alongside anticipatory.)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Case cannot advance to CALCULATION until the `service_verifications` record is SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED (FR-18) **and** `qualifying_service_records.sr_verified=true`.
  - AC2: No-dues is a checklist with per-item owner/status; case cannot reach PENDING_SANCTION until CLEARED (or anticipatory/provisional exception).
  - AC3: Anticipatory pension issues a provisional PPO (ANTICIPATORY) within the configured cap and is later superseded by the final PPO with adjustment.
  - AC4: Outstanding dues recorded and netted into terminal settlement, never silently ignored.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Anticipatory pension ≤ configured % of estimated pension; anticipatory gratuity withheld until no-dues. BR2: SR verification gaps must be condoned by order (E29) before counting as qualifying. BR3: No-dues blocking items hold gratuity but not the basic anticipatory pension.
- **Data Model References:** `separation_cases`, `service_verifications` (gate), `qualifying_service_records`, `service_register_events` (read/verify), `ppo_records` (ANTICIPATORY), `terminal_settlements` (recoveries).

### FR-M11-04 — Qualifying Service Computation **(enhanced)**

- **Module:** M11-F04
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, SR Custodian
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want qualifying service computed from verified service with non-qualifying spells deducted and counted prior service added so that pension and gratuity use the legally correct service length.
- **Description:** Compute gross service joining→retirement/death, enumerate non-qualifying spells, deduct uncondoned spells, **add structured counted prior/military service from `prior_service_records` (E39)**, apply VRS weightage where applicable, and round to reckonable half-years per E36. Determines `meets_min_pension_service` (E35 threshold) which routes to FULL_PENSION vs SERVICE_GRATUITY. Produces an auditable, locked `qualifying_service_records`. Runs only after the FR-18 verification record is signed off.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: `net_qualifying = gross − Σ(uncondoned non-qualifying days) + Σ(counted prior-service days)`; condoned spells (E29) count as qualifying.
  - AC2: Reckonable half-years rounded per E36 (e.g. ≥3 months = a half-year); capped per E36.
  - AC3: Each non-qualifying spell traces to a source (M03/M04 event, M09 order, or manual with justification) and is reason-code-attested in FR-18.
  - AC4: VRS weightage added only when rules permit and within cap (capped at date-of-superannuation service).
  - AC4a: **(new)** Counted prior service from E39 is added only when `verified=true` and `pension_already_drawn=false`; military/prior-central/state/temporary types handled per pro-forma rules.
  - AC5: `meets_min_pension_service` set from E35; if false, FR-05 produces SERVICE_GRATUITY_ONLY (no FULL_PENSION). Record locks on verification; later changes require a new version.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: EOL on medical certificate may be qualifying; otherwise non-qualifying (attested in FR-18). BR2: Dies-non never qualifies. BR3: Min qualifying service enforced via E35 (else service gratuity per FR-07). BR4: **(new)** Prior service counted distinctly from VRS weightage; both feed net qualifying but are tracked separately (`prior_service_days` vs `weightage_years`).

### FR-M11-05 — Pension Calculation (OPS / NPS / UPS, Service Gratuity, NPS Defaults) **(enhanced — R2, R3)**

- **Module:** M11-F05
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want pension computed under the correct regime — including service gratuity for short service, UPS assured payout, and NPS death/invalidation defaults — so that every cohort is statutorily correct.
- **Description:** Branch by `benefit_outcome`:
  - **OPS, ≥10 yrs qualifying:** basic pension = **flat 50%** of emoluments base (last-drawn / 10-month average / beneficial-of-both), floored/capped to E35 minimum/maximum. *Proportionate reduction for short service is removed.*
  - **OPS/UPS/NPS, <10 yrs qualifying:** **no pension** — route to **SERVICE_GRATUITY** (FR-07); set `benefit_outcome=SERVICE_GRATUITY_ONLY`.
  - **UPS (opted-in):** **assured payout ≈ 50% of last-12-month average pay** (AVG_12_MONTH), with the E35 UPS minimum guarantee; `benefit_outcome=UPS_ASSURED`.
  - **NPS death-in-service / invalidation:** compute the **CCS-NPS Rules 2021 default benefit** = OPS-equivalent family/invalid pension; `benefit_outcome=NPS_DEFAULT_FAMILY`/`NPS_DEFAULT_INVALID`.
  - **NPS superannuation (no default):** record corpus/PRAN, produce **indicative** (non-binding, non-deterministic) annuity/lump-sum; `benefit_outcome=NPS_INDICATIVE`.
  A full `calc_trace` and the `rule_version_ref` (FK) are persisted.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: **(rewritten)** OPS basic pension = **flat 50%** of emoluments base for **≥10 years** qualifying service (no proportionate reduction).
  - AC1a: **(new)** For **<10 years** qualifying, no monthly pension is produced; the case is routed to SERVICE_GRATUITY (FR-07) and `benefit_outcome=SERVICE_GRATUITY_ONLY`.
  - AC2: Emoluments method selectable (last-drawn / 10-month average / beneficial-of-both / **12-month average for UPS**) and snapshotted from M10.
  - AC3: Statutory minimum and maximum (E35) enforced with flags.
  - AC4: **(rewritten)** NPS superannuation is marked non-OPS; defined-benefit pension is not fabricated; indicative figures labelled non-binding and excluded from determinism.
  - AC4a: **(new)** NPS death-in-service/invalidation computes the CCS-NPS Rules 2021 OPS-equivalent default benefit.
  - AC4b: **(new)** UPS opted-in cases compute the assured payout (~50% of 12-month average) with the UPS minimum guarantee.
  - AC5: Re-computation with identical inputs and the snapshotted rule version is identical; rule version recorded as FK.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Scheme from `separation_cases.pension_scheme` + `ups_opted_in`. BR2: Emoluments exclude non-reckonable allowances per rule. BR3: Age-based additional pension increments (80/85/90/95/100) scheduled as future revisions (FR-13). BR4: **(new)** SERVICE_GRATUITY branch is mutually exclusive with FULL_PENSION (IR3a).

- **Edge Cases:** Net just below/above 10 years (service-gratuity vs flat-50% boundary); pay anomaly in last 10/12 months; revision retro-affecting emoluments; OPS/NPS/UPS borderline DOJ/opt-in; re-employed pensioner; NPS death-in-service default vs indicative.

### FR-M11-06 — Commutation of Pension **(enhanced — R11)**

- **Module:** M11-F06
- **Primary Role(s):** Retiring Employee (opt), Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a retiring employee, I want to commute a portion of my pension into a lump sum so that I receive upfront capital, with my residual pension and restoration date correctly computed from the reduction date.
- **Description:** Capture the commutation option (fraction ≤ statutory max), resolve the commutation factor by age-next-birthday from `commutation_factors` (E31, FK captured), compute commuted value = commuted monthly pension × factor × 12, reduce the monthly pension to residual **from the reduction-effective date**, and schedule restoration = **reduction date + statutory period (15 yrs)**. Disambiguates commutation/payment/reduction dates and handles migrated pensioners with unknown dates.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Commuted fraction bounded by statutory maximum (e.g. 40%); over-limit rejected.
  - AC2: Commutation factor resolves from the effective E31 table by age-next-birthday (factor row FK captured).
  - AC3: Commuted value, residual pension, and the **reduction-effective date** are computed and shown with trace.
  - AC3a: **(new)** `restoration_due_date = reduction_effective_date + 15 yrs`; for migrated pensioners with `migrated_date_unknown=true`, restoration is flagged for manual review, not auto-scheduled.
  - AC4: Residual pension feeds the PPO; restoration is scheduled and later applied (FR-12) restoring full basic.
  - AC5: Opting out leaves full basic pension and no commuted value.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Commutation requires medical fitness unless within the no-medical window post-retirement. BR2: **(rewritten)** Pension is reduced from the **date of receipt of commuted value** (`reduction_effective_date`); restoration is 15 yrs from that date, not from retirement. BR3: Commuted portion still attracts DA on the full (un-commuted) basic per rule.

### FR-M11-07 — Gratuity Computation (Retirement, Death & Service) **(enhanced — R2, Improvement 21)**

- **Module:** M11-F07
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want retirement, death and service gratuity computed with the correct slabs and an auto-stepping statutory ceiling so that the lump-sum benefit is accurate and within limits.
- **Description:** Compute **retirement gratuity** = ¼ × emoluments (basic+DA) × qualifying half-years (capped), **death gratuity** by service-length slabs, and **service gratuity** (for <10-year qualifying service: a one-time lump sum, e.g. ½ month's emoluments per completed half-year, **no DCRG ceiling**). The statutory ceiling is resolved from `gratuity_ceilings` (E33) and **auto-steps up 25% whenever DA crosses each 50% threshold**. Death/retirement gratuity apportioned to nominees (E21) for death cases.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Retirement gratuity uses capped qualifying half-years and the E33 ceiling; `payable=min(computed,ceiling)`.
  - AC2: Death gratuity applies the correct slab multiplier by service length.
  - AC2a: **(new)** Service gratuity (service <10 yrs) computes the one-time lump sum with **no DCRG ceiling** and `gratuity_type=SERVICE_GRATUITY`.
  - AC3: Death gratuity apportioned per nominee shares totalling 100% (E21).
  - AC4: Gratuity may be withheld pending no-dues **or fully withheld pending Rule-9 proceedings** (FR-22).
  - AC5: Ceiling-applied/withheld flags set; the E33 ceiling row used is captured (`ceiling_ref`).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Emoluments = basic + DA at retirement/death date. BR2: Half-years capped per E36. BR3: Statutory ceiling effective-dated (E33). BR3a: **(new)** Ceiling auto-steps +25% per 50% DA threshold crossed, driven by E33 (`da_threshold_pct`, `auto_step_pct`) — no manual master-data edit. BR4: No minimum-service bar for death gratuity (payable from day one).

### FR-M11-08 — Family & Enhanced Family Pension **(enhanced — R1, R4, R14)**

- **Module:** M11-F08
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), HR Admin
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want family pension computed at the correct path-specific rate to the statutorily-eligible family member(s) so that bereaved families are paid accurately, including dual and twin cases.
- **Description:** Compute family pension at the normal rate (e.g. 30% of emoluments, E32) and, where eligible, the enhanced rate (e.g. 50%) for a **path-specific window driven by `enhanced_basis`**: **death-in-service → enhanced for 10 years with no age cap**; **death-after-retirement → enhanced for 7 years or up to age 67 / the date the deceased would have superannuated, whichever earlier**. Eligibility and hierarchy derive from the **statutory family-members register `family_members` (E26)** by `statutory_rank` — never from nominees. Supports **dual family pension** (both spouses employees, subject to the E32 cap) and **simultaneous twin/multiple eligible children** shares (`concurrent_share_pct`). Maintains eligibility review dates and transfer to the next eligible member on cessation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Normal and enhanced amounts compute from emoluments × E32 rates.
  - AC2: **(rewritten)** Enhanced window is computed from `enhanced_basis`: IN_SERVICE = +10 yrs, no age cap; AFTER_RETIREMENT = min(+7 yrs, age-67, would-be-superannuation date). Then steps down to normal automatically (scheduled).
  - AC2a: **(new)** The applied window rule is recorded in `enhanced_window_rule` for audit; both step-downs are tested.
  - AC3: **(rewritten)** The active recipient and hierarchy come from `family_members` (E26) by `statutory_rank`; on cessation, pension transfers to the next eligible member (not stops) unless none remain.
  - AC4: Disabled-dependent members receive lifelong family pension per rule.
  - AC5: Both death-in-service and conversion-on-pensioner-death paths produce a family-pension record and a FAMILY_PENSION PPO.
  - AC6: **(new)** Dual family pension is permitted (both spouses enterprise servants) subject to the E32 dual cap; twins/multiple eligible children draw simultaneously per `concurrent_share_pct` summing to 100%.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Enhanced rate = min(enhanced formula, would-be pension) per rule. BR1a: **(new)** Window selection is mandatory and path-driven (IR8a). BR2: **(replaced)** The absolute "only one beneficiary at a time" is removed; dual family pension and simultaneous twin/eligible-children shares are allowed per rule (IR14). BR3: Remarriage/employment may cease eligibility except for disabled children/widow per rule. BR4: **(new)** Family-pension recipient is the rule-defined family member (E26); nomination (E21) does not confer family-pension eligibility.

- **Edge Cases:** Multiple eligible children sequencing/twins (concurrent shares); disabled child lifelong; remarriage of widow (rule-dependent); after-retirement window shorter due to age-67; both spouses enterprise servants (dual FP cap); simultaneous death of employee and spouse; nominee present but not a family member (must not receive family pension).

### FR-M11-09 — Terminal Benefits & Final Settlement (with Tax/TDS) **(enhanced — R12)**

- **Module:** M11-F09
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Payroll Officer (M10)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a composite final settlement that brings together leave encashment, gratuity, commuted value, GPF, recoveries, and statutory tax/TDS so that the employee's one-time dues are paid net of legitimate recoveries and correct tax.
- **Description:** Assemble the terminal settlement: leave encashment from M03 (× per-day emoluments, capped), gratuity (FR-07), commuted value (FR-06), GPF (FR-10), other dues, net legitimate recoveries within statutory protection, **and compute tax/TDS**: gratuity exemption (₹20L cap), commuted-pension exemption, leave-encashment exemption, taxable totals, TDS lines, and **Section 89(1) relief** on arrears. Produces gross, taxable, TDS, and net-of-tax settlement for authorisation and disbursement.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Leave encashment = min(encashable EL days, statutory cap) × per-day (basic+DA); shown as a line.
  - AC2: Settlement gross = Σ components; net = gross − recoveries − TDS; each recovery traces to an order.
  - AC2a: **(new)** Tax step computes per-component exempt/taxable splits (gratuity ₹20L cap, commutation exemption, leave-encashment exemption), TDS, and Section 89(1) relief on arrears, captured in `tax_breakdown`.
  - AC3: Recoveries cannot exceed statutory limits; excess deferred/flagged, never silently dropped.
  - AC4: Withheld components (gratuity pending no-dues, or fully withheld for Rule-9 proceedings) excluded from immediate payout and tracked.
  - AC5: Final settlement requires SANCTIONED benefit sub-calculations.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Leave encashment capped per rule (e.g. 300 days). BR2: Recovery priority and net protection per §16.3. BR3: Pending disciplinary case / Rule-9 proceedings withholds gratuity (M09/FR-22 linkage). BR4: **(new)** Tax exemptions/TDS computed from effective tax-rule parameters; exempt amounts and TDS surfaced; net-of-tax payout shown.
- **Data Model References:** `terminal_settlements` (incl. tax fields), M03 leave balance (read), `gratuity_calculations`, `commutation_records`, `gpf_final_settlements`, M09 recoveries (read).

### FR-M11-10 — GPF Final Withdrawal

- **Module:** M11-F10
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Payroll Officer (M10)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want the GPF final balance with interest and advances adjusted so that the provident-fund corpus is settled correctly at retirement or death.
- **Description:** Retrieve the GPF closing balance and contribution ledger from M10, compute interest to settlement date (effective GPF rate), deduct outstanding advances, derive final payable, apportion to nominees (E21) for death cases, and route for authorisation. NPS/UPS cases use NPS exit, not GPF.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Final payable = closing balance + interest-to-date − outstanding advances.
  - AC2: Interest computed at the effective GPF rate for the period.
  - AC3: Death cases apportion to nominees totalling 100% (E21).
  - AC4: GPF withdrawal requires authorisation distinct from the maker.
  - AC5: GPF only for GPF/OPS subscribers; NPS/UPS subscribers routed to NPS exit.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: GPF closing balance is the M10 system of record. BR2: Interest rate effective-dated. BR3: Unrecovered advances are mandatory deductions.
- **Data Model References:** `gpf_final_settlements`, M10 GPF ledger (read), `nominees_beneficiaries` (E21, read).

### FR-M11-11 — PPO Generation & Digital PPO **(enhanced — R10, Improvement 20)**

- **Module:** M11-F11
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (prepare), Sanctioning Authority (authorise)
- **User Story:** As a Sanctioning Authority, I want to issue a registry-numbered Pension Payment Order — service, family, anticipatory, provisional, or revised — so that the pensioner's entitlement is formally authorised and transmitted to the disbursing authority and delivered digitally.
- **Description:** Generate the PPO from sanctioned figures, allocate a unique `ppo_no`, render a digital PPO (e-PPO, M13), bind a PDA (carrying its disbursement model), **for PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF PDAs carry the basic + relief-formula reference**, and produce pensioner/disbursing halves. Supports SERVICE_PENSION, FAMILY_PENSION, ANTICIPATORY, **PROVISIONAL** (Rule 9, FR-22), and REVISED PPOs; a REVISED/final PPO supersedes the prior active PPO. On authorisation, the e-PPO is **pushed to DigiLocker** and the PPO is linked to Aadhaar/PRAN (FR-24).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: PPO issues only when the case is SANCTIONED (or anticipatory/provisional authorised for those types).
  - AC2: `ppo_no` unique and registry-allocated; a REVISED PPO references and supersedes exactly one ACTIVE PPO.
  - AC3: e-PPO generated as a signed artefact, available to self-service **and delivered to DigiLocker** (FR-24).
  - AC4: PPO carries basic pension, commuted portion, residual, effective-from, PDA binding, **and (for PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF) the relief-formula reference**.
  - AC5: Authorising the PPO creates/links the pensioner master record (FR-12).
  - AC6: **(new)** A PROVISIONAL PPO links to `provisional_pension_records` and is superseded by the final PPO on proceedings conclusion.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Anticipatory/provisional PPOs are superseded by the final PPO with adjustment. BR2: Authoriser ≠ preparer (SoD). BR3: PPO effective-from = pension commencement date. BR4: **(new)** For PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF, the PPO carries basic + relief formula; for M11_COMPUTES_FULL, the disbursement carries the full computed amount (FR-13/FR-14).

### FR-M11-12 — Pensioner Master & Lifecycle Management **(enhanced — R9 link, R11)**

- **Module:** M11-F12
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Pensioner/Family Pensioner (self-service), Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a pensioner master that tracks life certificates, restoration, family-pension conversion, and proactive death/fraud signals so that the pensioner is correctly maintained for life and beyond.
- **Description:** Maintain the `pensioners` record from PPO authorisation: capture annual LC/DLC, suspend disbursement on overdue LC, restore the commuted portion automatically at the **reduction-date+15yr** due date, and on a self-pensioner's death convert to family pension (E26-driven, FR-08, `enhanced_basis=AFTER_RETIREMENT`) creating the family-pension record and FAMILY_PENSION PPO. Consumes **proactive death-detection signals (FR-20)** and links any **overpayment recovery (E38)**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: LC has a yearly due date; overdue beyond grace sets `SUSPENDED_NO_LC` and holds disbursement.
  - AC2: Submitting/verifying an LC reactivates the pensioner and releases held pension with arrear.
  - AC3: At the restoration due date (reduction+15yr), the commuted portion is restored; `current_monthly_pension` reflects full basic.
  - AC4: On `date_of_death` for a self-pensioner, the system spawns family-pension conversion (E26/FR-08) and a FAMILY_PENSION PPO, moving the pensioner to CONVERTED_TO_FAMILY.
  - AC5: Pensioner contact/bank self-updates route through maker-checker **and pass pre-credit account verification (FR-14)** before disbursement uses them.
  - AC6: **(new)** A death detected via FR-20 (registry/DBT/anomaly) triggers conversion and, if pension was drawn after death, opens a `pension_overpayment_recoveries` (E38) row.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: LC grace period configurable. BR2: Restoration applies only to the original pensioner. BR3: Family-pension conversion uses the E26 family hierarchy. BR4: **(new)** Late-reported death reconciles drawn-after-death pension into E38 recovery.
- **Data Model References:** `pensioners`, `pensioner_life_certificates`, `commutation_records` (restoration), `family_pension_records`, `family_members` (E26), `ppo_records`, `pension_overpayment_recoveries` (E38).

- **Edge Cases:** Restoration coinciding with a DA revision (ordering §16.9); death reported late (E38 recovery from estate); LC submitted just after suspension; family pensioner's own death (next E26 member); fraudulent LC detection; death detected by FR-20 before family reports it.

### FR-M11-13 — Pension Revision (DA & Pay-Commission) **(enhanced — R6, R13)**

- **Module:** M11-F13
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), SysAdmin (rule tables)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to apply DA and pay-commission revisions across the pensioner population under a deterministic application order and the correct disbursement model so that every pensioner's pension stays current with arrears computed correctly.
- **Description:** Run revision batches branching on the **PDA disbursement model**:
  - **M11_COMPUTES_FULL PDAs:** recompute the full monthly figure (DA/pay-commission re-fixation), compute old vs new + arrears, and **instruct exact amounts** (FR-14).
  - **PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF (CPPC) PDAs:** **do not recompute every line**; instead **issue a relief order** (new DA% / pay-commission basis) for the bank to apply, and **reconcile** rather than instruct each amount.
  When multiple events share an effective date for one pensioner, apply them strictly in the **§16.9 deterministic order** (pay-commission re-fixation → commuted-portion restoration → DA → age-based additional pension). Also schedules age-based additional pension increments (80/85/90/95/100).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A DA-revision batch recomputes Dearness Relief for M11_COMPUTES_FULL pensioners as of the effective date; for PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF pensioners it issues a relief order and marks lines for reconciliation.
  - AC2: A pay-commission batch re-fixes basic pension and computes arrears from the effective date.
  - AC3: Old vs new and arrear amounts computed per pensioner with trace; batch requires approval before APPLY.
  - AC4: Applied revisions are immutable; corrections create a new batch.
  - AC5: Age-based additional pension increments auto-apply on the milestone birthday.
  - AC6: **(new)** When ≥2 events share an effective date for a pensioner, they apply in the mandatory §16.9 order; the applied order is recorded in `calc_trace` (tested invariant).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: DA/pay-commission parameters are effective-dated rule-table rows (E30, SysAdmin-approved). BR2: Family pensioners revised by the same batch with family-pension rules. BR3: Arrears netting respects prior over-payment (E38). BR4: **(new)** Revision branch and amount/relief-order behaviour are determined by `pensioners.disbursement_model`.
- **Data Model References:** `pension_revisions`, `pensioners`, `da_relief_rates` (E30), `pension_disbursing_authorities` (model), `pension_disbursements` (arrears), `pension_overpayment_recoveries` (netting).

- **Edge Cases:** Pensioner whose restoration/age-increment coincides with the revision (ordering §16.9); partial-month effective date; deceased between compute and apply (E38); pay-commission notional fixation anomaly; DA negative revision; mixed-model batch.

### FR-M11-14 — Treasury / Bank / PDA Integration (with Pre-Credit Verification) **(enhanced — R6, R8, R15)**

- **Module:** M11-F14
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (prepare), Sanctioning Authority (authorise), Treasury/PDA/Bank
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want to transmit authorised payment instructions to the disbursing authority over a defined interface, verify accounts before first credit, and reconcile acknowledgements so that pensioners are paid correctly and the most expensive error — paying a wrong account — is prevented.
- **Description:** Produce disbursement instruction batches per the **PDA interface contract (§8.6)** for first pension, monthly pension (per disbursement model), arrears, gratuity, commuted value, GPF, and terminal benefits; **run pre-credit account verification (penny-drop / name-IFSC / NPCI mapper, E42) before the first credit** to any account and block on mismatch; transfer PPO authorisation; track transmission and acknowledgement using the contract's ack schema and error taxonomy; reconcile paid/failed lines and raise exceptions/grievances; retry/re-route failures.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Only AUTHORISED instructions (SoD) are transmitted.
  - AC1a: **(new)** No FIRST_PENSION/TERMINAL/GRATUITY/GPF/COMMUTED_VALUE line is transmitted to an account unless a `bank_account_verifications` row for that account is PASSED; mismatch blocks the line (IR16).
  - AC2: Each line ties to a PPO/pensioner/case and an amount; batch totals reconcile to the sum of lines.
  - AC3: Acknowledgements update `instruction_status` per the §8.6 ack schema; failed lines raise exceptions/grievances using the bank/treasury error taxonomy.
  - AC4: First pension instruction generated to commence on the pension start date (no break).
  - AC5: Idempotent transmission prevents duplicate payments.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Invalid/missing bank or PDA binding blocks the line. BR1a: **(new)** Account verification (E42) must be PASSED before first credit; re-verification required on bank-detail change. BR2: Failed lines retried or re-routed, never silently abandoned. BR3: Monthly pension respects LC suspension and the disbursement model (full amount vs basic+relief for CPPC).
- **Data Model References:** `pension_disbursements`, `bank_account_verifications` (E42), `pension_disbursing_authorities` (E37, contract+model), `ppo_records`, `pensioners`, `terminal_settlements`, `pension_revisions` (arrears).

### FR-M11-15 — Retirement Self-Service Portal & Benefit Estimators / What-If **(enhanced — R16)**

- **Module:** M11-F15
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee / Retiring Employee, Pensioner (self-service)
- **User Story:** As a retiring employee, I want to see my retirement journey in plain language, estimate my benefits as outcomes I understand, and submit my forms online so that I can plan and act without visiting an office.
- **Description:** A self-service portal with a **3-state plain-language tracker** (In progress / Approved / Being paid) over the internal state machine, an **outcome-framed benefit estimator / what-if** that phrases results as decisions ("If you take ₹22.4 lakh now, your monthly pension is ₹33,600 instead of ₹56,000, and it returns to ₹56,000 in Oct 2041"), option submission (commutation, nominee, family-member, bank) via maker-checker, document upload, an **LC annual calendar**, and a **step-by-step bereavement/death-reporting guide** for families. Pensioners reuse the portal for e-PPO (incl. DigiLocker), LC, and grievances.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Estimators label results indicative/non-binding (`is_binding=false`) and never write to the live case.
  - AC2: What-if can vary commutation fraction, emoluments, and date, recomputing all headline figures, **expressed as plain-language outcomes** (take-now vs monthly-now vs restore-date).
  - AC3: Submitted options flow into the case via maker-checker, not directly into sanctioned data.
  - AC4: **(rewritten)** The employee sees a **3-state citizen tracker** (In progress / Approved / Being paid) — the internal state machine is not mirrored to the citizen; legal terms (PPO, commutation) are retained only where statutory, with plain-language explanations.
  - AC5: All self-service screens cover empty/loading/error/success/permission states (no skeleton placeholders).
  - AC6: **(new)** An **LC annual calendar** shows when the life certificate is due, the four submission options, and what happens if missed (plain language).

### FR-M11-16 — Pensioner Grievance Management

- **Module:** M11-F16
- **Primary Role(s):** Pensioner / Family Pensioner, Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a pensioner, I want to raise and track grievances so that issues like non-receipt, wrong amount, or unapplied revision are resolved within an SLA.
- **Description:** Grievance intake (categorised), routing, SLA tracking with escalation, linkage to case/PPO/disbursement, and resolution with audit. Auto-creates grievances from disbursement failures (FR-14) and surfaces ageing and SLA-breach analytics.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A grievance captures category, description, priority, and links to pensioner/case where known.
  - AC2: SLA due date set by category/priority; breach escalates to the Sanctioning Authority.
  - AC3: Disbursement failures auto-create a grievance linked to the failed line.
  - AC4: Resolution requires a recorded action and notifies the pensioner; reopen supported.
  - AC5: Grievance status follows the state machine with full audit.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: SLA matrix configurable by category/priority. BR2: Critical grievances (payment-not-received) auto-prioritise. BR3: Closure requires resolution text.
- **Data Model References:** `pension_grievances`, `pensioners`, `separation_cases`, `pension_disbursements` (link).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/grievances` | raise grievance |

### FR-M11-17 — Forecasting & Pension-Liability Analytics

- **Module:** M11-F17
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Department Head, Auditor
- **User Story:** As a Department Head, I want pension-liability and processing analytics so that I can plan budgets, staffing, and SLA compliance.
- **Description:** Analytics over the retirement pipeline and pensioner population: due-for-retirement workload by horizon/org/cadre; projected pension-liability (current/future, DA/pay-commission scenarios); benefit-cost breakdown (pension/gratuity/commutation/family pension); processing SLA & ageing (stage durations, first-pension-on-time); grievance trends; **and audit-objection ageing (FR-23)**. Read-only aggregations from M11 entities; feeds M14.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Liability projection aggregates `pensioners.current_monthly_pension` × 12 plus pipeline cases, with scenario sliders for DA/pay-commission.
  - AC2: Workload analytics show counts by horizon bucket, org unit, cadre.
  - AC3: SLA analytics compute first-pension-on-time rate and average stage durations.
  - AC4: All analytics respect org-unit row-level scope; export honours permissions.
  - AC5: Figures reconcile to underlying records (no fabricated aggregates).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Analytics read-only. BR2: Scenario projections labelled assumptions. BR3: Auditor sees all; managers see own scope.
- **Data Model References:** `retirement_forecasts`, `pensioners`, `separation_cases`, `pension_calculations`, `gratuity_calculations`, `family_pension_records`, `pension_grievances`, `audit_objections` (all read).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

### FR-M11-18 — Service-Record Completeness & Discrepancy Resolution **(new — R5)**

- **Module:** M11-F18
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), SR Custodian (M12), Payroll Officer (M10), Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a rigorous service-record completeness gate that resolves every discrepancy and attests every non-qualifying spell before any benefit is computed, so that determinism defends correct numbers rather than amplifying upstream defects.
- **Description:** Before CALCULATION, build a `service_verifications` (E27) record over the full service span: detect gaps and discrepancies into a **discrepancy ledger (E28)**; require **per-non-qualifying-spell reason-code attestation** (e.g., EOL medical vs non-medical, suspension regularised vs not); record condonations as **orders in a condonation register (E29)**, not free text; and require **multi-point sign-off** (SR Custodian + Payroll Officer + Pension Officer). CALCULATION is gated on this record being SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED with zero open discrepancies and all spells attested (IR2a).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A `service_verifications` record enumerates every gap/discrepancy as an E28 ledger line with type, period, source, and required resolution.
  - AC2: Each non-qualifying spell must be reason-code-attested (qualifying vs non-qualifying) before sign-off; unattested spells block sign-off.
  - AC3: Condonations are recorded as E29 orders (order no, date, authority, document) and linked to the resolving discrepancy.
  - AC4: Sign-off requires SR Custodian, Payroll Officer, and Pension Officer attestations; `signoff_complete=true` sets status SIGNED_OFF then LOCKED.
  - AC5: A case cannot enter CALCULATION (FR-04/FR-05) unless the record is SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED, `discrepancy_open_count=0`, and `spells_attested_count=spells_total_count` (IR2a).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Free-text resolution is not accepted for condonation — an E29 order is mandatory. BR2: Reason codes for spells must come from the controlled list (drives qualifying/non-qualifying treatment in FR-04). BR3: Re-opening a locked verification (new evidence) creates a new version and re-gates downstream calcs.
- **Data Model References:** `service_verifications` (E27), `service_discrepancies` (E28), `condonation_orders` (E29), `non_qualifying_spells` (attestation), `service_register_events` (M12, read), M03/M04/M09/M10 (read).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/cases/{id}/service-verification:build` | build/refresh the verification + discrepancy ledger |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/cases/{id}/service-verification` | verification + ledger + attestations |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/cases/{id}/service-verification/discrepancies/{did}:resolve` | resolve a ledger line (attest/condone/regularise) |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/cases/{id}/service-verification:signoff` | multi-point sign-off → SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Verification workbench: discrepancy ledger grid (type, period, source, status, resolution), spell-attestation panel with reason-code dropdowns, condonation-order register with document upload, a three-signature sign-off bar (SR Custodian / Payroll / Officer), and a prominent "gate status" banner showing whether CALCULATION is unblocked.
- **Edge Cases:** Legacy spell with no reason code (must be attested before sign-off); condonation order on paper only (scan + register); overlapping discrepancies; sign-off attempted with open lines (blocked); new evidence after lock (re-version); prior-service discrepancy (links E39).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `ServiceVerificationBuilder`, `DiscrepancyDetector`, `SpellAttestationService`, `CondonationRegister`, `MultiSignoffGate` |
| Backend Flow | Build span → detect gaps/discrepancies → write ledger → require attestations + condonation orders → collect three sign-offs → set SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED → unblock FR-04/05 |
| Data Operations | Insert E27/E28/E29; update spell attestations; version on re-open |
| Validation | All discrepancies resolved; all spells attested; condonation orders present; three sign-offs |
| Authorization | Officer build/resolve; SR Custodian + Payroll + Officer sign-off; Authority oversight |
| State Changes & Side Effects | verification DRAFT→DISCREPANCIES_OPEN→ATTESTED→SIGNED_OFF→LOCKED; gates case CALCULATION |
| Failure Handling | Open lines on sign-off → 409 `DISCREPANCY_UNRESOLVED`; unattested spell → 409 `SPELL_NOT_ATTESTED`; missing condonation order → 422 |

### FR-M11-19 — Effective-Dated Pension Rule-Table Management **(new — R7, Improvement 21)**

- **Module:** M11-F19
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (maintain), Sanctioning Authority / Rule Approver (approve), Auditor (read)
- **User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want first-class, effective-dated, versioned rule tables for every benefit parameter so that the benefit engines compute against real, approved, auditable rows instead of a free-text reference.
- **Description:** Manage the rule-table entities — `da_relief_rates` (E30), `commutation_factors` (E31), `family_pension_rates` (E32), `gratuity_ceilings` (E33, with DA-linked auto-step), `retirement_age_rules` (E34), `pension_limit_rules` (E35), `rounding_rules` (E36) — each effective-dated and versioned with a DRAFT→APPROVED→EFFECTIVE→SUPERSEDED lifecycle and SoD (maintainer ≠ approver). Every benefit calculation's `rule_version_ref` is a foreign key to the exact EFFECTIVE row used on the relevant date (IR17). The gratuity ceiling auto-steps +25% per 50% DA threshold crossed (E33), driven by E30 (Improvement 21).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each rule table supports effective-dated rows with non-overlapping effective windows per key; creating a new effective row supersedes the prior.
  - AC2: A rule row follows DRAFT→APPROVED→EFFECTIVE→SUPERSEDED; only an approver distinct from the maintainer can APPROVE (SoD).
  - AC3: Benefit engines resolve the EFFECTIVE row for the relevant date and capture its id as `rule_version_ref` (FK); SUPERSEDED rows remain referenced by historic calcs (immutability, IR17).
  - AC4: The gratuity ceiling (E33) auto-computes `current_effective_ceiling` by stepping +25% (`auto_step_pct`) each time DA (E30) crosses each 50% threshold (`da_threshold_pct`) — no manual ceiling edit.
  - AC5: Missing/inactive rule rows for a required date raise `RULE_NOT_EFFECTIVE` to the calling engine.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: SysAdmin maintains; a distinct approver approves (SoD); SysAdmin cannot approve their own change. BR2: Enterprise-notification reference is captured per row. BR3: No row may be deleted once referenced by any calc; it is SUPERSEDED.
- **Data Model References:** `da_relief_rates`, `commutation_factors`, `family_pension_rates`, `gratuity_ceilings`, `retirement_age_rules`, `pension_limit_rules`, `rounding_rules` (E30–E36).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |

| POST | `/api/v1/pension/rules/{table}` | create DRAFT row |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/rules/{table}/{rowId}:approve` | approve (SoD) → APPROVED/EFFECTIVE |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/rules/{table}/resolve?asOf=YYYY-MM-DD` | resolve the EFFECTIVE row for a date |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Rule-table admin with a table selector, effective-dated row grid (version, window, status), a maker-checker approval flow, a diff view between versions, and a gratuity-ceiling panel showing the DA-driven auto-step computation; read-only for Auditor.
- **Edge Cases:** Overlapping effective windows (rejected); approving as the maintainer (blocked by SoD); a calc referencing a now-SUPERSEDED row (allowed for history); DA crossing two thresholds at once (two auto-steps); retro-effective row affecting pending calcs (re-resolve).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `RuleTableService`, `EffectiveDateResolver`, `RuleApprovalWorkflow`, `GratuityCeilingAutoStepper` |
| Backend Flow | Create DRAFT → approve (SoD) → set EFFECTIVE + supersede prior → engines resolve by date → E33 auto-step from E30 |
| Data Operations | Insert/version rule rows; non-overlap constraint per key; FK from calcs |
| Validation | Non-overlapping windows; SoD on approve; no-delete-if-referenced; auto-step math |
| Authorization | SysAdmin maintain; distinct Approver approve; Auditor read |

### FR-M11-20 — Proactive Death Detection & Overpayment Recovery **(new — R9)**

- **Module:** M11-F20
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority, Auditor
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want proactive detection of pensioner deaths and payment anomalies plus a structured recovery-from-estate workflow so that pension is not drawn into a deceased pensioner's account for months and any overpayment is recovered.
- **Description:** Run a **death-registry / Aadhaar-DBT reconciliation job** and **payment-anomaly/dormancy detection** against the pensioner population to flag probable deaths and suspicious patterns earlier than the passive annual LC suspension. On a confirmed death where pension was drawn after the date of death, open a `pension_overpayment_recoveries` (E38) row, halt further disbursement, trigger family-pension conversion (FR-12/FR-08), and drive **recovery from family pension / estate / legal heir** with a "pension drawn after death" exception report.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A scheduled job reconciles pensioner records against death-registry/Aadhaar-DBT signals and flags probable deaths with a confidence/source.
  - AC2: Anomaly detection flags dormancy/abnormal patterns (e.g., no LC + unusual withdrawal) for review.
  - AC3: On confirmed death with post-death drawal, an E38 recovery row is created (overpaid amount, period), disbursement is held, and FR-12 conversion is triggered.
  - AC4: Recovery supports modes FROM_FAMILY_PENSION / FROM_ESTATE / FROM_LEGAL_HEIR / WRITE_OFF, each audited; partial recovery tracked.
  - AC5: A "pension drawn after death" exception report lists all open post-death drawals with ageing.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Detection signals are advisory until confirmed; confirmation requires officer action or an authoritative registry match. BR2: Recovery-from-estate follows the statutory order and protections. BR3: DBT/registry data processed under DPDP purpose-limitation, retained only as needed.
- **Data Model References:** `pension_overpayment_recoveries` (E38), `pensioners` (death fields), `family_pension_records` (conversion), `pension_disbursements` (hold).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| POST | `/api/v1/pension/overpayments/{id}:recover` | record recovery (mode, amount) |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/reports/drawn-after-death` | exception report |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Death-detection console with flag queue (source, confidence), confirm/dismiss actions, an overpayment-recovery workspace (overpaid amount, period, mode, legal-heir details, progress), and the drawn-after-death exception report with ageing.
- **Edge Cases:** False-positive registry match (dismiss with reason); death confirmed long after the fact (large overpayment); pensioner already converted (recover from family pension); legal-heir dispute; write-off approval; signal source unavailable (job degrades gracefully).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `DeathReconciliationJob`, `AnomalyDetector`, `OverpaymentRecoveryService`, `ExceptionReporter` |
| Backend Flow | Reconcile pensioners vs registry/DBT → flag probable deaths/anomalies → on confirmation open E38 + hold disbursement + trigger FR-12 → drive recovery → report |
| Data Operations | Insert E38 rows; update pensioner death fields; hold disbursement lines |
| Validation | Confirmation before recovery; statutory recovery order; DPDP retention |
| Authorization | Officer confirm/recover; Authority approve write-off; Auditor read |
| State Changes & Side Effects | E38 IDENTIFIED→NOTIFIED→UNDER_RECOVERY→RECOVERED/WRITTEN_OFF/LEGAL; disbursement hold; conversion trigger |
| Failure Handling | Signal source down → job degrades, flags carried over; false positive → dismiss with reason |
| Dependencies | FR-12, FR-08, FR-14; external death-registry/Aadhaar-DBT |
| Test Guidance | Reconciliation match; anomaly flagging; post-death overpayment creation + hold; recovery modes; exception report ageing; false-positive handling |

### FR-M11-21 — PDA Registry & Disbursement Model + Interface Contract **(new — R6, R8)**

- **Module:** M11-F21
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (maintain), Pension Officer, Treasury/PDA/Bank (integration), Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As an administrator, I want each Pension Disbursing Authority registered with an explicit disbursement model and a defined interface contract so that FR-13/FR-14 behave correctly per PDA and the longest-lead integration is not a launch-blocker.
- **Description:** Maintain `pension_disbursing_authorities` (E37) with `pda_disbursement_model` (**M11_COMPUTES_FULL** vs **PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF**), interface type (FILE_SFTP/REST_API), the §8.6 file/API field list and acknowledgement schema, the bank/treasury error taxonomy, retry/re-route semantics, penny-drop capability, and a sandbox-certification flag. The model drives FR-13 (recompute-and-instruct vs notify-relief-order-and-reconcile) and FR-14 (full amount vs basic+relief). Opening and certifying each PDA contract is a week-1 parallel workstream (§13).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: Each PDA records its disbursement model, interface type, contract version, ack schema, and penny-drop capability.
  - AC2: FR-13 and FR-14 branch on `pda_disbursement_model`; a PDA cannot go live (`status=ACTIVE`) until `sandbox_certified=true`.
  - AC3: The interface contract (§8.6) defines the disbursement file/API field list, ack schema, and bank/treasury error taxonomy; transmissions conform to the PDA's contract version.
  - AC4: Retry/re-route semantics are configured per PDA and honoured by FR-14.
  - AC5: Changing a PDA's model or contract is audited and re-certified in sandbox before taking effect.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: SysAdmin maintains; Authority approves go-live after sandbox certification. BR2: A pensioner/PPO bound to a PDA inherits its model (denormalised to `pensioners.disbursement_model`). BR3: No production transmission to an uncertified PDA.
- **Data Model References:** `pension_disbursing_authorities` (E37), `ppo_records`/`pensioners`/`pension_disbursements` (binding), §8.6 contract.

- **UI Behavior Notes:** PDA registry with model badges (M11_COMPUTES_FULL / PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF), interface/contract version, penny-drop capability, sandbox-certification status, and activate gate; contract-field reference (§8.6) link.
- **Edge Cases:** PDA changing from treasury to CPPC (model change, re-certify); contract version bump; uncertified PDA bound to a case (block go-live); mixed-model pensioner migration; re-route to an alternate PDA on persistent failure.

### FR-M11-22 — Provisional Pension (Rule 9 — Pending Proceedings) **(new — R10)**

- **Module:** M11-F22
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer (maker), Sanctioning Authority (checker), Disciplinary Authority (M09)
- **User Story:** As a Pension Officer, I want a first-class provisional-pension path for retirees with pending departmental/judicial proceedings so that they are paid a provisional pension while DCRG is fully withheld until the proceedings conclude.
- **Description:** When `separation_cases.proceedings_pending=true`, create a `provisional_pension_records` (E41) with a provisional monthly pension and **fully-withheld DCRG (death-cum-retirement gratuity)**, issue a **PROVISIONAL PPO** (FR-11), and pay the provisional pension to avoid a break. On proceedings conclusion (M09 linkage), regularise to a final pension/PPO (release withheld DCRG) or apply the decided recovery — never silently release DCRG before conclusion.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: A case with pending proceedings produces a `provisional_pension_records` row and a PROVISIONAL PPO; provisional pension is payable from commencement (no break).
  - AC2: DCRG is **fully withheld** (`dcrg_withheld=true`, amount captured) and excluded from terminal settlement payout until conclusion.
  - AC3: On conclusion, `conclusion_outcome` ∈ {EXONERATED, PENALTY_NO_RECOVERY, PENALTY_WITH_RECOVERY} drives regularisation: EXONERATED/PENALTY_NO_RECOVERY → release DCRG and issue final PPO superseding the provisional; PENALTY_WITH_RECOVERY → apply recovery then release the balance.
  - AC4: The M09 proceedings reference is mandatory and the linkage guard prevents final sanction/DCRG release while proceedings are ACTIVE.
  - AC5: Provisional pension is later adjusted against the final pension with arrears/recovery.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: DCRG release is impossible while `provisional_pension_records.status=ACTIVE`. BR2: Provisional pension amount per rule (typically equals the would-be pension). BR3: Conclusion must reference the M09 decision.
- **Data Model References:** `provisional_pension_records` (E41), `separation_cases` (proceedings flags), `ppo_records` (PROVISIONAL), `gratuity_calculations` (DCRG withheld), `terminal_settlements` (exclusion).

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Provisional-pension panel showing proceedings reference/status, provisional monthly amount, fully-withheld DCRG, a conclusion action with outcome selector, and the regularisation/recovery preview; PROVISIONAL badge on the PPO composer.
- **Edge Cases:** Proceedings prolonged for years (continuing provisional pension); employee dies during proceedings (family pension + DCRG handling); exoneration with arrears; penalty with partial recovery; proceedings under appeal; conversion of anticipatory→provisional.

### FR-M11-23 — Audit Objection Management **(new — Improvement 19)**

- **Module:** M11-F23
- **Primary Role(s):** Auditor / AG, Pension Officer, Sanctioning Authority
- **User Story:** As an Auditor, I want AG/internal-audit objections against pension cases tracked from raise to closure with linkage to the case and calculation trace so that the module's audit-objection-traceability goal is a built capability, not a slogan.
- **Description:** Capture audit objections (`audit_objections`, E40) raised by AG/internal audit/treasury against a case/PPO/pensioner, linked to the disputed `calc_trace`; route to the Pension Officer for response within an SLA; record the outcome (accepted-and-corrected via a linked revision, dropped, recovery raised, settled); and surface ageing/closure analytics (FR-17, §12).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An objection captures source, linked case/PPO/pensioner, the disputed `calc_trace` reference, and objection text.
  - AC2: An SLA due date is set; the objection routes to the responsible Pension Officer with escalation on breach.
  - AC3: A response is recorded; the outcome drives closure — ACCEPTED_CORRECTED links a `pension_revisions` correction; DROPPED closes with rationale; RECOVERY_RAISED links an E38 recovery.
  - AC4: Objection status follows RAISED→UNDER_RESPONSE→RESPONDED→ACCEPTED/DROPPED→CLOSED with full audit.
  - AC5: Open objections are visible on the case and in the Audit & Compliance Register (§12).
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Closure requires a recorded outcome and rationale. BR2: A correction is applied only through the amendment/revision workflow (never a silent edit). BR3: Auditor raises; Officer responds; Authority approves corrective revision.
- **Data Model References:** `audit_objections` (E40), `separation_cases`, `ppo_records`, `pensioners`, `pension_revisions` (correction), `pension_overpayment_recoveries` (recovery link).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/audit-objections` | raise an objection |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/audit-objections/{id}` | objection detail |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/audit-objections/{id}:respond` | record response |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/audit-objections/{id}:close` | close with outcome |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Audit-objection inbox with SLA timers, source/priority, linked case/PPO/trace context, response form, outcome selector (with revision/recovery linkage), and an ageing/closure dashboard; Auditor-facing tracker.
- **Edge Cases:** Objection on a closed case; objection requiring a rule re-interpretation (escalate); objection withdrawn by audit; multiple objections on one case; objection leading to recovery from a deceased pensioner's estate (E38).
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `AuditObjectionService`, `SLATimer`, `OutcomeResolver` (revision/recovery linkage) |
| Backend Flow | Raise → set SLA → route → respond → resolve outcome (link revision/recovery) → close |
| Data Operations | Insert/update E40; link to case/PPO/trace/revision/recovery |
| Validation | Required fields; outcome + rationale on close; correction via revision workflow |
| Authorization | Auditor raise; Officer respond; Authority approve corrective revision |
| State Changes & Side Effects | RAISED→UNDER_RESPONSE→RESPONDED→ACCEPTED/DROPPED→CLOSED; notifications |
| Failure Handling | Close without outcome → 422; correction outside workflow → 409 |
| Dependencies | FR-05..13 (calc_trace), FR-13 (revision), FR-20 (recovery), FR-17/§12 |
| Test Guidance | Trace linkage; SLA/escalation; outcome-driven closure; revision/recovery linkage; register visibility |

### FR-M11-24 — Digital Delivery & DigiLocker / DBT Linkage **(new — Improvement 20)**

- **Module:** M11-F24
- **Primary Role(s):** Pension Officer, Pensioner (self-service), System Administrator
- **User Story:** As a pensioner, I want my signed e-PPO and revision orders delivered to DigiLocker and my PPO linked to my Aadhaar/PRAN so that I have authoritative, portable digital access to my pension documents — matching the DoPPW *Bhavishya* best-in-class bar.
- **Description:** On PPO authorisation (FR-11) and on revision-order issue (FR-13), **push the signed e-PPO/revision order to DigiLocker** as an issued document, record the DigiLocker reference, and **link the PPO to the pensioner's Aadhaar/PRAN** for DBT and death-reconciliation (FR-20). Provide a resilient, retrying delivery channel with a self-service fallback download. The pre-retirement workflow is benchmarked against *Bhavishya* (§13).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AC1: An authorised e-PPO is pushed to DigiLocker; `ppo_records.digilocker_pushed=true` and `digilocker_ref` recorded.
  - AC2: Revision orders (DA/pay-commission) are similarly delivered to the pensioner's DigiLocker.
  - AC3: The PPO is linked to Aadhaar/PRAN (`pensioners.aadhaar_masked`/`pran`) for DBT and FR-20 reconciliation.
  - AC4: DigiLocker push is non-blocking — failure queues a retry and does not block PPO authorisation; a self-service fallback download is always available.
  - AC5: Delivery status is visible to the pensioner and officer.
- **Business Rules:** BR1: Only signed, authorised artefacts are delivered. BR2: Aadhaar/PRAN stored encrypted, masked, access-logged (DPDP). BR3: Delivery failures retried with backoff; never silently dropped.
- **Data Model References:** `ppo_records` (digilocker fields), `pensioners` (aadhaar/pran), `documents` (M13, signed e-PPO), `pension_revisions` (orders).
- **API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/ppos/{id}:deliver-digilocker` | push e-PPO to DigiLocker |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/revisions/{id}:deliver-digilocker` | push revision order |
| GET | `/api/v1/pension/ppos/{id}/delivery-status` | delivery status |
| POST | `/api/v1/pension/pensioners/{id}:link-aadhaar-pran` | link Aadhaar/PRAN |

- **UI Behavior Notes:** Delivery panel on the PPO composer and pensioner 360 showing DigiLocker delivery status (delivered/queued/failed-retrying), Aadhaar/PRAN linkage status (masked), and a fallback download button; pensioner self-service shows "Available in DigiLocker" with a link.
- **Edge Cases:** DigiLocker outage (queue + retry); pensioner without DigiLocker/Aadhaar (fallback download, manual linkage later); Aadhaar mismatch; revision order delivery for a converted family pensioner; re-delivery after a REVISED PPO supersession.
- **LLD:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Components | `DigiLockerPublisher`, `AadhaarPRANLinker`, `DeliveryRetryQueue` |
| Backend Flow | On PPO/revision authorisation → render signed artefact (M13) → push to DigiLocker → record ref → link Aadhaar/PRAN → on failure enqueue retry |
| Data Operations | Update ppo digilocker fields; pensioner aadhaar/pran; delivery-status log |
| Validation | Signed artefact only; encryption/masking; retry on failure |
| Authorization | Officer/system deliver; Pensioner read own; SysAdmin config |
| State Changes & Side Effects | digilocker_pushed set; retry queue; notifications |
| Failure Handling | DigiLocker down → queue + backoff (non-blocking); Aadhaar mismatch → flag for manual linkage |
| Dependencies | FR-11, FR-13, FR-20, M13; external DigiLocker/UIDAI/CRA |
| Test Guidance | e-PPO + revision delivery; ref capture; Aadhaar/PRAN linkage; non-blocking failure + retry; fallback download |

### 8.6 PDA / Treasury Interface Contract (new — R8)

Defines the concrete disbursement interface that FR-14/FR-21 implement; replaces v1's "pluggable" hand-wave.

- **Transport:** FILE_SFTP (signed, encrypted batch files) or REST_API (mTLS), per `pension_disbursing_authorities.interface_type`.
- **Disbursement line fields:** `batch_no`, `line_no`, `ppo_no`, `pensioner_no`, `disbursement_type`, `period_month/year`, `amount` (M11_COMPUTES_FULL) **or** `basic_pension` + `relief_formula_ref` (PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF), `account_no` (encrypted), `ifsc`, `account_name`, `verification_ref` (E42), `idempotency_key`.
- **Batch header/trailer:** `pda_code`, `contract_version`, `line_count`, `control_total`, `generated_at`, `signature`.
- **Acknowledgement schema:** per-line `ack_status` ∈ {PAID, FAILED, RETURNED}, `ack_reference`, `failure_code` (from the error taxonomy), `paid_at`; batch-level `acknowledged_count`, `failed_count`, `control_total_ack`.
- **Bank/treasury error taxonomy:** `ACCOUNT_CLOSED`, `ACCOUNT_FROZEN`, `NAME_MISMATCH`, `INVALID_IFSC`, `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `DUPLICATE`, `PENSIONER_DECEASED`, `OTHER` — each mapped to an M11 exception/grievance.
- **Retry / re-route:** failed lines retried per PDA policy (max attempts, backoff); persistent failures re-routed to an alternate PDA or raised as grievances; idempotency prevents double payment.
- **Sandbox tie-out:** every PDA must pass a sandbox batch (control-total tie-out, ack round-trip, penny-drop) before `sandbox_certified=true` and go-live (FR-21).

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Performance (interactive) | P95 < 500ms for reads/config; benefit estimator < 1.5s; account verification (penny-drop) < 3s |
| Performance (batch) | **M11_COMPUTES_FULL:** DA revision for 100,000 pensioners within 30 min; monthly disbursement batch < 10 min. **PDA_APPLIES_RELIEF:** relief-order issue + reconciliation is far lighter (transmit orders, not 100k computed lines) — target < 5 min |
| Determinism | **Identical results given the snapshotted rule version (E30–E36 FK) and signed-off verified inputs.** External/indicative NPS-CRA and UPS-annuity figures are excluded from the guarantee. Concurrent-event application follows the §16.9 order (tested invariant) |
| Input provenance | No benefit engine runs without a SIGNED_OFF/LOCKED service-verification record (FR-18, IR2a) |
| Continuity (critical) | First pension/anticipatory/provisional authorised before pension commencement for 100% of cases |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime; batch windows off-peak |
| Scalability | Horizontal scaling of revision/disbursement workers; partition pensioner population by PDA/org/model |
| Integrity | ACID per case sanction, PPO issue, conversion, revision-apply, death-conversion; immutable sanctioned snapshots & applied revisions; pre-credit verification before first credit |
| Security | OIDC/SSO+MFA; RBAC+row-level scope; SoD (incl. rule-table maker≠approver); field-level encryption for bank/PAN/Aadhaar/PRAN/nominee/family/benefit amounts; masked display with audited reveal |
| Privacy | DPDP Act 2023; PII minimisation; heightened sensitivity for deceased/family data; death-registry/DBT data purpose-limited; statutory retention (pensioner life + tail) |
| Auditability | Every state change in `audit_log`; immutable; `calc_trace` retained; audit objections tracked to closure (FR-23) |
| Recoverability | RPO ≤ 15min, RTO ≤ 4h; staged compute allows safe restart of revisions/disbursements |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA; plain-language, compassionate flows; 3-state citizen tracker; large-text/elderly-friendly self-service |
| Observability | First-pension-on-time SLA, LC-overdue alerts, disbursement-ack monitoring, revision exception dashboards, drawn-after-death exceptions, audit-objection ageing |
| Compliance | Statutory pension/commutation/gratuity/family-pension/UPS/NPS-default/tax rules; effective-dated rule-table versioning (FR-19); audit-objection traceability (FR-23) |

## 13. Migration & Launch

### 13.1 Data Migration

- Migrate the existing pensioner population: pensioner master, current pension, PPO numbers, **PDA bindings + disbursement model**, bank details (encrypted), **Aadhaar/PRAN**, LC status, and commutation/restoration schedules (**capturing reduction dates; flag `migrated_date_unknown` where unavailable**).
- Migrate in-flight separation cases at their current stage with verified service and computed benefits where available; build service-verification records (FR-18) for in-flight cases.
- Map legacy separation types and schemes (**OPS/NPS/UPS**); **load and sign off the effective-dated rule-table entities (E30–E36): DA, commutation factors, family-pension rates, gratuity ceilings (with auto-step), retirement ages, min/max, rounding** — the genuine critical path.
- Load the **family-members register (E26)** (Form 3/14) for active family pensioners distinct from nominee registers (E21); load **prior-service records (E39)**.

### 13.2 Validation & Parallel Run

- Recompute a statistically significant sample of legacy pensions/gratuities (incl. **service-gratuity, UPS, NPS-default, path-specific family pension, tax**) and reconcile within tolerance; investigate variances.
- Run a parallel DA revision against legacy output and tie out per-pensioner deltas **per disbursement model**.
- Validate PPO-number uniqueness and PDA bindings; **dry-run a disbursement batch in a sandbox PDA channel with the §8.6 contract and penny-drop tie-out** (FR-21).
- Tie out the **gratuity-ceiling auto-step** against the current DA level.

### 13.3 Cutover & Launch

- Freeze legacy writes; final delta migration; switch disbursement instructions to M11; verify the first post-cutover monthly disbursement end-to-end with PDA acknowledgement **per model**.
- Enable pensioner self-service (3-state tracker, outcome estimator, e-PPO/DigiLocker, LC calendar, bereavement guide) after data validation.
- Benchmark the pre-retirement workflow against the **DoPPW *Bhavishya*** model; enable **DigiLocker** delivery (FR-24).

### 13.4 Launch Readiness Checklist

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Benefit Computation Order (default sequence, amended)

1. **Build & sign off service verification (FR-18)** → 2. Verify gap-free service (M12) → 3. Compute qualifying service (deduct non-qualifying spells, **add counted prior service**, round half-years) → 4. Resolve emoluments base (M10) → 5. **Route by benefit outcome:** ≥10 yrs → basic pension (OPS flat-50% / UPS assured / NPS-default); <10 yrs → service gratuity; NPS superannuation → indicative → 6. Commutation (option, factor, value, residual, **reduction-date restoration schedule**) → 7. Gratuity (retirement/death/service, slab, **ceiling with DA auto-step**) → 8. Family pension (path-specific window, E26-driven) → 9. Leave encashment (M03) → 10. GPF final → 11. **Tax/TDS/89(1)** → 12. Net recoveries within protection → 13. Sanction (provisional if proceedings) → 14. PPO issue (+ DigiLocker) → 15. **Pre-credit account verification** → 16. Disbursement & pensioner enrolment.

### 16.2 Rounding & Money Rules

- All amounts `NUMERIC(15,2)`; factors/rates `NUMERIC(9,4)`; service in integer Y/M/D; no floating point.
- Benefit/half-year rounding per `rounding_rules` (E36), referenced via `rule_version_ref` (FK).

### 16.3 Recovery Priority & Net Protection

Statutory dues → court attachment → disciplinary recovery (M09) → enterprise over-payment (incl. **post-death overpayment E38**) → outstanding loans/advances (M10) → other. Breaching the protected floor defers lower-priority recoveries (`RECOVERY_EXCEEDS_PROTECTION`); spillover recovered from future pension/estate where rules allow.

### 16.4 Immutability & Correction Policy

A SANCTIONED calculation, an ISSUED/ACTIVE PPO, and an APPLIED revision are immutable. Corrections are issued as a SUPERSEDING calculation/REVISED PPO, a new revision batch, or a recovery/arrear — never a silent edit. Anticipatory/provisional PPOs are superseded by the final PPO with adjustment. Rule-table rows are SUPERSEDED, never deleted once referenced (IR17). Audit-objection corrections flow only through the revision workflow (FR-23).

### 16.5 Pension Eligibility & Service Gratuity (amended — R2)

- **≥10 years qualifying service:** flat **50%** of emoluments base (no proportionate reduction). The pre-2006 proportionate fraction is deprecated.
- **<10 years qualifying service:** **no monthly pension** — a one-time **service gratuity** (`gratuity_type=SERVICE_GRATUITY`), computed as a multiplier of emoluments per completed half-year, with **no DCRG ceiling**.
- The branch is determined by `qualifying_service_records.meets_min_pension_service` against `pension_limit_rules` (E35).

### 16.6 OPS vs NPS vs UPS Handling (amended — R3)

- Scheme derived from DOJ vs cutover + UPS opt-in; override audited.
- **OPS:** M11 computes defined-benefit pension, commutation, gratuity, family pension, GPF.
- **NPS — superannuation:** record corpus/PRAN; **indicative** annuity/withdrawal (non-binding, excluded from determinism); NPS exit/annuity handoff; no GPF.
- **NPS — death-in-service/invalidation:** compute the **CCS-NPS Rules 2021 default benefit** = OPS-equivalent family/invalid pension.
- **UPS (opted-in):** **assured payout ≈ 50% of last-12-month average pay** with the E35 minimum guarantee; opt-in recorded and irreversible per rule.

### 16.7 Enhanced Family Pension Windows (new — R1)

| Path (`enhanced_basis`) | Enhanced rate window | Step-down |
|---|---|---|
| IN_SERVICE (death-in-service) | **10 years, no age cap** (post-2013 CCS amendment) | to normal after 10 yrs |
| AFTER_RETIREMENT (death after retirement) | **7 years OR up to age 67 / the date the deceased would have superannuated, whichever earlier** | to normal at window end |

Both windows are computed from `family_pension_rates` (E32) and recorded in `enhanced_window_rule`; both step-downs are tested invariants.

### 16.8 Tax / TDS on Terminal Benefits (new — R12)

| Component | Exemption treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gratuity (DCRG) | Exempt up to the ₹20,00,000 cap; excess taxable | `gratuity_exempt_amount` / `gratuity_taxable_amount` |
| Commuted pension | Exempt per rule (enterprise employees fully exempt) | `commutation_exempt_amount` |
| Leave encashment | Exempt per the applicable cap | `leave_encashment_exempt_amount` |
| Arrears (revision/89(1)) | Section 89(1) relief computed | `section_89_relief` |
| TDS | Deducted on the net taxable total | `tds_amount`; `net_settlement = gross − recoveries − TDS` |

### 16.9 Deterministic Revision-Application Order (new — R13)

When multiple events share an effective date for one pensioner, apply strictly in this order; record the applied order in `calc_trace`:

1. **Pay-commission re-fixation** (re-fixes the basic).
2. **Commuted-portion restoration** (changes the base on which relief is computed).
3. **DA / Dearness Relief** (applied on the re-fixed/restored basic).
4. **Age-based additional pension** (80/85/90/95/100-year increments).

This ordering is part of the determinism contract (IR18) and a tested invariant.

### 16.10 Assumptions Log (amended)

- Single legal entity per deployment (entity-aware for future multi-entity).
- All benefit parameters are **first-class effective-dated rule-table rows (E30–E36)** entered by SysAdmin and approved by a distinct approver (SoD); `rule_version_ref` is a FK.
- **Disbursement model is explicit per PDA** (E37); FR-13/FR-14 branch on it; batch sizing differs by model.
- PDA/treasury/bank conforms to the **§8.6 interface contract**; sandbox certification precedes go-live.
- Jeevan Pramaan/DLC and **DigiLocker/UIDAI/CRA** integrations available with fallbacks.
- Death-registry/Aadhaar-DBT signals available for FR-20 reconciliation (advisory until confirmed).
- Determinism holds **given the snapshotted rule version and signed-off verified inputs**; external NPS/UPS-annuity figures are excluded.
