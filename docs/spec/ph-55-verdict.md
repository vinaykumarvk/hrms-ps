# PH-55 (Remediation Tranche 42) — Human-Gate Verdict

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Chains from:** `docs/spec/ph-54-verdict.md` (tranche 41)
**Baseline:** `docs/reviews/brd-coverage-delta-20260703.md`
**Branch:** ph02-rerun (merged to main per sub-phase)

## Suite evidence (oracle-recomputed)

- API `npm test`: **547 pass**, 0 fail, 1 skipped (DATABASE_URL-gated PH-06 persistence test).
- Web `npm run web:test`: **133 pass**, 0 fail.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run web:typecheck`: green.

The PH-55A oracle (and the PH-37A gate at its raised floor) were run **externally** by the driver and are
GREEN. This opens the **second pass** of the coverage workstream — going deeper into the modules starting
from the lowest (PS01). Built by hand — subagents credit-exhausted until 2026-07-08.

> **GREEN here is necessary, not sufficient.** Human review required before advancing.

## What tranche 42 closed — coverage ratcheted further with real, tested routes

| Module | Route exposure | Backing | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PS01** | governed write-ports (`POST /employees/{id}:governed-identity-change`, `:apply-transfer-posting`, `:apply-probation-confirmation`) + live-record/count reads (`GET /employees/{id}/live-record`, `GET /employees:list-live-records`, `GET /employees:count`) | existing `employeeMasterService` (atomic SR-ledger multi-step identity change + attribute history; write-ports other modules call; NOT_FOUND fail-closed), service-tested | `ph55a-ps01-governed-writeport-route.test.cjs` |

Real behavioral routes over already-tested backing — **not** scaffolding. Measured contract coverage ratchets
**513 / 38.8% → 519 / 39.2%** (PS01 **26.7% → 30.3%**), and the PH-37 gate floor was raised in lockstep so the
gain is locked.

## Remaining gaps (still open — this is NOT a 100% claim)

- **Contract coverage is 39.2%** — ~804 of the **1,323** contracted operations remain unimplemented. The
  coverage tool is still **count-based**, not per-operation path matching. The second pass continues into the
  next-lowest modules **PS14 (28.9%)**, PS13 (31.6%), PS07 (33.3%), PS10 (34.5%).
- **Persistence workstream:** the hand-built services (PH-16F..PH-55 engines) use in-memory repositories;
  Postgres-backed repos + migrations remain deferred; the `ph06-persistence` migration list froze at 0008.

**Contract-op caveat (quantified):** the OpenAPI contract enumerates **1,323** operations; **519** are
implemented as behavioral kernel routes (**39.2%**).

## Recommendation for the human reviewer

Approve PH-55B, OR direct a further tranche (PH-56). The active workstream (per your steer) is raising
measured coverage by exposing real, tested backing, with the ratchet gate proving each gain and forbidding
regression; the second pass is under way, going deeper into each module from the lowest. The standing
**persistence migration workstream** remains the alternative. Carried debt is unchanged: in-memory
repositories for the newest services.
