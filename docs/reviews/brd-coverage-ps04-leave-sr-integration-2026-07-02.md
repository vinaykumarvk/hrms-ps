# BRD Coverage Review — PS04 Leave-SR Integration

Date: 2026-07-02
BRD under review: `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md`
Verdict: **FAIL — relay proof slice implemented, full PS04 integration BRD not yet implemented**

## Scope

The PS04 BRD defines 18 functional requirements from `FR-01` through `FR-18` (`docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:813`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1882`). It covers signed transactional capture, governed mapping, partitioned relay, retry/DLQ, maker-checker triage, state-aware reconciliation, correction/remediation, qualifying-service flags, statutory annotations, historical digitisation, deterministic replay/backfill, monitoring, evidence packs, lease reaping, PS12 port conformance, source-ledger integrity, and pre-pension certification.

## Evidence Base

Executable implementation found:

- Single backend service file: `apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts`.
- Single route file: `apps/api/src/routes/ps04.routes.ts`.
- Single PS04 web module: `apps/web/src/modules/ps04/LeaveSrRelayWorkspace.tsx`.
- Service supports in-memory enqueue for approved leave and cancellation (`apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:49`, `apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:69`), direct relay to PS12 ingest (`apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:107`), simulated relay failure into `FAILED` / `DEAD_LETTERED` (`apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:95`), dead-letter replay/discard (`apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:142`, `apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:153`), list and count-only reconciliation (`apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:169`, `apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:174`).
- PS03 calls the PS04 relay directly on leave approval and cancellation (`apps/api/src/modules/ps03/leaveService.ts:222`, `apps/api/src/modules/ps03/leaveService.ts:275`).
- Routes expose only the PH-07 proof surface: outbox list, reconciliation summary, relay, replay, and discard (`apps/api/src/routes/ps04.routes.ts:17`, `apps/api/src/routes/ps04.routes.ts:30`, `apps/api/src/routes/ps04.routes.ts:38`, `apps/api/src/routes/ps04.routes.ts:55`, `apps/api/src/routes/ps04.routes.ts:65`).
- Tests prove idempotent relay, DLQ replay/discard, route exposure, and status counts (`apps/api/test/ph07-ps04-relay.test.cjs:32`, `apps/api/test/ph07-ps04-relay.test.cjs:54`, `apps/api/test/ph07-ps04-relay.test.cjs:82`).
- UI renders a compact proof card with total/posted/DLQ/discarded counts and evidence bullets (`apps/web/src/modules/ps04/LeaveSrRelayWorkspace.tsx:7`, `apps/web/src/modules/ps04/LeaveSrRelayWorkspace.tsx:22`, `apps/web/src/modules/ps04/LeaveSrRelayWorkspace.tsx:40`).

Specification/design coverage found:

- OpenAPI describes a broad `/api/v1/lsr` PS04 management surface and the PS12-owned `/api/v1/sr/ingest` write port (`docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:12`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:17`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:85`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:300`).
- OpenAPI separately records the PH-07 implemented minimum route set under `/api/v1/leave-sr/...` (`docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:32`).
- SQL data model defines 14 PS04-owned integration entities, including outbox, mapping, posting log, DLQ, reconciliation, corrections, historical batches, config, partition lease, conformance, integrity findings, and pre-pension certificate (`docs/data-model/04-PS04-leave-sr-integration.sql:5`, `docs/data-model/04-PS04-leave-sr-integration.sql:134`, `docs/data-model/04-PS04-leave-sr-integration.sql:625`).
- State machines define the intended PS04 lifecycle with `PENDING`, `EXCLUDED`, `BLOCKED_AWAITING_ORIGINAL`, `IN_FLIGHT`, `POSTED`, `FAILED`, `DEAD_LETTERED`, partition lease/reaper, P01 DLQ review, reconciliation remediation, and historical batch adjudication (`docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml:260`, `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml:269`, `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml:282`, `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml:294`, `docs/contracts/state-machines.yaml:307`).

## User-Facing Coverage

The BRD requires an integration operations console covering inbound queue, mapping catalog, posting log, DLQ triage, reconciliation findings, remediation, historical batches, replay/backfill, dashboard metrics, audit evidence, port conformance, capture integrity, and pre-pension certificates (`docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:48`, `docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:78`). Current UI is a static PH-07 proof panel with four counters and two evidence bullets (`apps/web/src/modules/ps04/LeaveSrRelayWorkspace.tsx:22`, `apps/web/src/modules/ps04/LeaveSrRelayWorkspace.tsx:40`).

## Test Coverage Assessment

Existing tests are useful but narrow:

- Idempotent relay and count reconciliation are tested in `apps/api/test/ph07-ps04-relay.test.cjs:32`.
- DLQ replay/discard are tested in `apps/api/test/ph07-ps04-relay.test.cjs:54`.
- Route exposure is tested in `apps/api/test/ph07-ps04-relay.test.cjs:82`.
- Web tests assert marker strings for route/client/panel presence, not operational behavior (`apps/web/test/ph07-employee-wave.test.cjs:12`, `apps/web/test/ph07-employee-wave.test.cjs:29`).
- No automated tests were found for signed atomic capture, mapping publish, partition leasing, ordering, backoff, classification, P01 DLQ maker-checker, state-aware reconciliation findings, remediation, correction links, qualifying-service flags, annotations, historical digitisation, deterministic backfill, metrics/alerts, evidence export, lease reaper, conformance gate, integrity reconciliation, or pre-pension certificates.

Validation baseline captured during this review:

- `npm test` passed: 125/125 API tests.
- `npm run web:test` passed: 32/32 web tests.
- These green checks validate the implemented proof slices; they do not close the PS04 BRD gaps listed here.

## Critical Gaps

| Gap ID | Severity | Gap | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PS04-COV-001 | Critical | PS04 runtime is an in-memory relay proof slice, not the signed, transactional, DB-backed integration substrate required by the BRD. | Runtime service `apps/api/src/modules/ps04/leaveSrRelayService.ts:38`-`234`; BRD FR-01 `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:813`; schema outbox `docs/data-model/04-PS04-leave-sr-integration.sql:134` |
| PS04-COV-002 | Critical | Full `/api/v1/lsr` contract surface is not implemented; only five `/api/v1/leave-sr` proof routes exist. | OpenAPI full surface `docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:85`-`1596`; implemented marker `docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:32`; route file `apps/api/src/routes/ps04.routes.ts:17`-`75` |
| PS04-COV-003 | Critical | Reliability controls needed for enterprise SR correctness are absent: partition leases, ordering guard, reaper, posting log, state-aware reconciliation, source-ledger integrity, and conformance gate. | BRD FR-03/06/15/16/17 `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:940`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1133`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1697`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1759`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1820` |
| PS04-COV-004 | High | Statutory business capabilities are absent: mapping catalog, qualifying-service rules, annotations, historical digitisation, evidence pack, and pre-pension certificate. | BRD FR-02/09/10/11/14/18 `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:876`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1329`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1391`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1449`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1639`, `docs/brd/v3/PS04-leave-sr-integration.md:1882` |
| PS04-COV-005 | High | UI is not a usable IntegOps/SR Custodian workspace. | Full OpenAPI tags `docs/contracts/openapi/PS04.yaml:48`-`78`; current UI `apps/web/src/modules/ps04/LeaveSrRelayWorkspace.tsx:7`-`46` |

## Scorecard

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| BRD line-item implementation | 8 / 18 FRs touched, 0 / 18 complete | FR-01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 08, 12, 13, 14, 16 are partial or proof-only; remaining statutory/reliability controls are gaps |
| API contract conformance | Low | Implemented route set is much smaller and uses proof namespace `/leave-sr`, while full contract is `/lsr` |
| Data model coverage | High as design artefact | SQL models the full bridge, but runtime uses in-memory arrays |
| Backend behavior | Medium for relay proof slice | Direct PS03 to PS04 to PS12 path works for simple approved/cancelled leave |
| Frontend behavior | Low | Static proof card only |
| Automated tests | Medium for proof slice, low for full BRD | Tests cover relay/DLQ/routes only |

Overall status: **Not release-complete for PS04.** The current implementation is a good proof that the PS03 leave decision can reach PS12 through a PS04-owned relay, but it does not implement the reliability, statutory, operational, and evidence controls that make PS04 a production-grade leave-to-SR bridge.

## Recommended Remediation Path

1. Keep the existing PS03-to-PS04-to-PS12 relay tests as regression baseline.
2. Implement the DB-backed signed outbox and posting log first: FR-01, FR-03, FR-04, FR-15.
3. Add mapping catalog and statutory rule pinning before expanding leave types: FR-02, FR-09, FR-10.
4. Add state-aware reconciliation, remediation, and source-ledger integrity before production data migration: FR-06, FR-07, FR-17.
5. Add correction/reversal chains and deterministic backfill: FR-08, FR-12.
6. Add operational console, evidence pack, conformance gate, historical digitisation, and pre-pension certificate after the reliability spine is in place: FR-11, FR-13, FR-14, FR-16, FR-18.
