# Employee Personal Details Modification Workflow — PrimeSoft HRMS Module BRD (PS02, v3.0 · platform-grounded)

**Module code:** PS02-EPDM (was `M02-EPDM`; re-keyed per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §B)
**Program:** PrimeSoft HRMS — public-sector configuration & extension of the **PrimeSoft HRMS platform** (Master BRD v2.1 · Vision v2.6 · Platform Spec v1.6 · RBAC v1.7 · Foundation FS v1.6)
**Document version:** v3.2 (field reconciliation — adds the DPDPA `pii_tier_id` axis on `field_sensitivity_catalog` per prototype recon; see **Amendments (v3.1 → v3.2)** below. Baseline v3.0 platform-re-grounded — re-anchors v2.0 onto the PrimeSoft engines P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3)
**Supersedes (content lineage):** v2.0 (`docs/brd/v2/M02-personal-details-modification-workflow.md`) — all v2 content, rigor, FR structure, entities and traceability are preserved; only the *substrate* is re-grounded.
**Relationship to PrimeSoft:** **EXTEND of PrimeSoft M01 sensitive-field-change.** The maker-checker self-service edit already exists as the platform **"Request change → approval"** UI state (Foundation §3) routing **`E·AR` (Approval-Required)** fields (PAN/Aadhaar/passport/DL/bank — RBAC §7) to the sensitive-changes workflow on **P01 WorkflowEngine** (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §A row PS02; Foundation §3; Platform §P01 — "Callers: M01 sensitive-field change"). PS02 **configures** that flow (W.1) and adds the public-sector statutory controls; it **authors no new workflow, RBAC, audit, notification, job or form engine.**
**Status:** Baseline for build (platform-consistent, parallel-agent ready).
**Authoring standard:** Consumes `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` and `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` by id. The invented `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` conventions used by v2 are overridden per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C and re-grounded here.

## Amendments (v3.1 → v3.2: field reconciliation)

Add-only reconciliation of the Section 5 data model against the PrimeSoft prototype change-request / self-service screens. No requirement, FR, entity or routing behaviour changed; one genuine field gap was closed.

| # | Change | Entity.field | Type | Source | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R3.2-1 | Added the DPDPA **PII-tier classification** axis to the field catalog — the tier label the prototype renders had no data home. Distinct from the approval-routing `sensitivity`; does not alter P01 route resolution. | `field_sensitivity_catalog.pii_tier_id` → platform `pii_tiers` (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`; index `ix_fsc_pii_tier`) | Add-only FK column | Prototype `sensitive-changes` screen (FR-M01-003) — groups requests by "PII Tier 1 / PII Tier 2"; recon `docs/data-model/reconciliation/prototype-ps02.md` | §5.2 E5 field table + note |

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Employee Personal Details Modification Workflow (**PS02-EPDM**) is the **governed change-control configuration** sitting in front of the employee master (**PS01** — Employee Profile Management, which extends the PrimeSoft **M01** master). It runs the existing PrimeSoft **"Request change → approval"** pattern for `E·AR` sensitive fields on **P01 WorkflowEngine**, and layers the public-sector statutory controls onto it: auditable, **maker-checker-approved** (SoD enforced by **P01/P02**, not re-coded), document-backed change requests with full before/after diff, multi-level routing by field sensitivity, **P01 SLA-driven escalation**, commit of approved sensitive changes to the **PS01 employee master** — on which **PS01 (the master/identity owner) posts the identity/personal-data event into the PS12 Digital Service Register** (`source_module=PS01`); **PS02 is not itself a Digital-SR source** — adversary-resistant fraud controls, data-subject rights, employment-status gating, **P05 tamper-evident audit (DB-trigger dual-log; OPEN-PLAT-03 hash-chaining)**, and a closed-loop downstream retro-impact reconciliation with payroll/pension/seniority.

PS02 **does not own** the employee data fields themselves — **PS01/M01** owns them. PS02 owns the **request, review, approval, e-signature, effective-dating, commit-back, reversal and reconciliation lifecycle** that mutates those fields safely, expressed as **P01 instances whose subject/context is a PS02 change request**. PS02 is the only sanctioned write path for self-service and routine HR-officer edits to governed PS01/M01 fields.

### 1.2 Business problem

In the current/legacy public-sector process: employees mail or hand paper forms to HR; clerks key changes directly into the master with no segregation of duties; sensitive changes (name, date of birth, bank account, caste/category, qualification) are altered without consistent documentary proof or senior sign-off; there is no field-level history of *who* changed *what*, *when*, on *whose authority*, and against *which document*; statutory changes are not reliably mirrored into the Service Register; pending requests stall with no SLA or escalation; **the data subject is never told when someone else changes their record; deceased/retired records can be silently re-banked for pension/terminal-benefit fraud; auth-bearing contact channels can be hijacked to divert OTP and salary; and the downstream pay/pension recomputation that the disputes actually turn on is fire-and-forget.** This creates audit findings, pension/seniority disputes, payroll mis-credits (wrong bank account), and fraud exposure (silent DOB/name/bank changes, mule accounts, collusion rings).

### 1.3 Solution overview

PS02-EPDM delivers (each on a named PrimeSoft engine — see **§ Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform**):

- **Self-service change requests** — employees (and HR officers on behalf) propose field changes through guided **W.2 forms** scoped by **P02 `Authorization.check`** (ownership, scope, field access, PII ceiling), gated by employment status and a fresh **step-up re-authentication** (platform MFA, §3.1) for HIGH/STATUTORY.
- **Field-level diff** — structured before/after per field, with reason, effective date (**`effective_from`** staged via the PS01 effective-date job, §3.3), and explicit *clear/remove* intent.
- **Configurable sensitivity & approval matrix** — each governed field is classified (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / STATUTORY) and mapped to `E·AR` where applicable; auth-bearing contact channels (phone/email) are MEDIUM-minimum; identity numbers (Aadhaar/PAN) are HR-only with authority re-verification; high-sensitivity fields demand documentary proof, strong (non-OTP) e-signature and senior/multi-level approval.
- **Maker-checker via P01** — built on **P01 WorkflowEngine** (`startInstance · advance · approve · reject · sendBack · delegate · cancel · query`, each idempotent), supporting the **Appendix-D patterns** (`SEQUENTIAL`, `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`, `PARALLEL_ANY_OF`, `CONDITIONAL`, `DYNAMIC_APPROVER`), **in-flight version pinning**, and SoD enforced by **P02** (deny-by-default, multi-role intersection, no self-approval).
- **Supporting-document & authority-portal evidence** — documents stored in **PS13** (extends PrimeSoft M11 Document Management), linked to request items, verified by reviewers; caste/category changes require authority-portal certificate verification.
- **Correction vs. Update distinction & effective-dating** — reuses the platform effective-dating mechanism (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`; PS01 `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`). DOB alteration near retirement is a configurable **hard-block** routed to a separate legal process.
- **Data-subject rights** — out-of-band notice + confirmation/objection window via **X.2/W.3**; a DPDPA-aligned grievance/objection path that can pause commit or trigger reversal.
- **Fraud, velocity & anomaly detection** — mule-account, pre-payroll/pre-separation spike, and device/velocity signals feed a fraud-review queue (a **CONDITIONAL/DYNAMIC_APPROVER** P01 stage injection).
- **Emergency reversal / break-glass** — fast, dual-authorised reversal of a committed erroneous change; the reversing change is committed to PS01, on which PS01 posts the reversing PS12 SR event.
- **Closed-loop downstream reconciliation** — the `governed-field-changed`/retro-impact event to PS10/PS11/PS06 is tracked, acknowledged, retried (**X.1 runner** guarantees) and reconciled with the same rigor as SR posting.
- **Tamper-evident audit** — **P05** dual logs (`audit_log` + `security_audit_log`, DB-trigger capture, immutable, ≥7-yr) with tamper-evidence tracking **OPEN-PLAT-03** (periodic hash-chaining to WORM) — not a parallel mechanism.
- **Bulk HR-initiated corrections, rejection/resubmission, SLA & escalation (P01 runtime), statutory SR posting**, delegation, change-request templates (W.2), strong e-signature, parallel/sequential topologies, effective-dated application.

### 1.4 Scope summary

In scope: the full change-request lifecycle for governed PS01/M01 fields, plus data-subject rights, fraud signalling, reversal, and downstream retro reconciliation — all configured on platform engines. Out of scope: definition/storage of the master fields themselves (**PS01/M01**), the SR ledger internals (**PS12**), the document object store internals (**PS13**), the *execution* of payroll/pension recomputation (**PS10/PS11/PS06** perform it; PS02 tracks the acknowledgement), promotion-eligibility business logic (**PS06** owns it; PS02 raises the freeze flag), and authentication/MFA/SSO/step-up challenge (**platform §3.1 / P02**; PS02 *invokes* it).

### 1.6 Primary stakeholders

Employees (self-service requesters **and data subjects**), Reporting Managers (recommenders → P01 reporting-chain approver resolution), HR Officers / HR Admin (reviewers/checkers, bulk-correction makers, fraud-queue triage), Department Heads / **Appointing Authority** (senior approvers for STATUTORY, dual-authorisers for break-glass), **Grievance Officer** and **Fraud Reviewer** (RBAC **capability flags** added per RBAC §4.3), **SR Custodian / Registrar** (consumes statutory postings via PS12 — new entity-scoped role + capability flag), Auditor (mapped to **Org-Admin read + read-only entitlement** + P05 query access), System Administrator (mapped to **Org Admin / Platform Super Admin**; approval-matrix & sensitivity configuration via W.1/W.2). Roles map to the **RBAC v1.7** taxonomy with enterprise statutory actors expressed as **ADDITIONS** (new roles + capability flags), per `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6.

### 1.7 (See §1.8) Amendments summary

v3 keeps **all** v2 architecture, requirements, FRs, entities and rigor (23 FRs; data-subject rights; statutory hard-rules; tamper-evidence; downstream closed loop) and **re-grounds** them onto the existing PrimeSoft platform: the invented approval/maker-checker/audit/role/error machinery is replaced by **P01/P02/P05**, the platform API conventions and error table, the RBAC v1.7 model, multi-tenancy, and the `VAL-*/MSG-*/ERR-*/JOB-*` catalogues. The v1→v2 hardening map is retained in §1.8; the **v2→v3 platform re-grounding** map is in the dedicated **§ Amendments (v2 → v3)** section near the end.

### 2.2 Common Capabilities (cross-cutting, inherited from the platform)

- **Maker-checker by default** for any governed-field mutation, run as **configured P01 flows (W.1)**; SoD enforced by **P01/P02** (no self-approval; multi-role intersection), never re-coded.
- **Field-level, tamper-evident audit** to **P05** (`audit_log` for data mutations, `security_audit_log` for auth/permission/admin events) via **DB-trigger capture** — 100% mutation capture, zero gaps; tamper-evidence per **OPEN-PLAT-03** (periodic hash-chaining to WORM).
- **Multi-tenant data-layer scoping** — every PS02 table carries **`tenant_id`/`entity_id`**; scoping is enforced in the persistence layer; an unscoped query is **rejected, not defaulted to "all"** (Platform §0.1).
- **Row-level + field-level access** via **P02 `Authorization.check`** (deny-by-default → role grant → multi-role intersection → entitlement → capability flag → **PII ceiling** → scope filter → field mask on serialization).
- **Soft delete + immutable history** — requests never hard-deleted (platform "no hard delete"); ledgers append-only; P05 immutable.
- **Optimistic concurrency** — every commit to PS01/M01 validates the master version token / `old_value_hash`.
- **Idempotent commit, posting, retro & reversal** — keyed per §16.3; re-runs are no-ops (aligns with P01 idempotent `advance` and the **`Idempotency-Key`** API header).
- **Data-subject first-class** — the employee whose record changes is always notified out-of-band (X.2) when someone else initiates the change, and can object.
- **Employment-status aware** — every request is gated by the target's PS01/M01 `employment_status`.
- **Internationalisation** — UTC storage; `DD-MMM-YYYY` display; INR money formatting; WCAG 2.1 AA UI (platform NFR §8.2).
- **Cursor pagination** — all list endpoints use cursor paging (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100, `next_cursor`); offset paging is not used.

### 2.3 Explicit Boundaries (In / Out)

| Concern | In PS02 | Out of PS02 (owner) |
|---|---|---|
| Governed-field change lifecycle (as P01 subject/context) | ✅ | — |
| Definition/storage of employee master fields | — | PS01 / PrimeSoft M01 |
| Field history *display* sourced from PS02 commits | ✅ | Master record source = PS01/M01 |
| Statutory SR event *posting* of approved changes | — (commits the change to PS01, which posts) | SR event is posted by **PS01** (master/identity owner, `source_module=PS01`) on commit; SR ledger & validation = PS12 (on P05 substrate). **PS02 is not an SR source/writer** and never carries `source_module=PS02` SR payloads |
| Document binary storage, versioning, encryption | — | PS13 / PrimeSoft M11 (PS02 stores references) |
| Authority-portal (UIDAI/PAN/caste-portal) verification *call* | ✅ (invokes via X.3 + records) | Portal/registry = external authority |
| Payroll/pension/seniority recomputation *execution* | — | PS10 / PS11 / PS06 (consume + acknowledge event) |
| Retro-impact event tracking & reconciliation | ✅ | Recompute logic = PS10/PS11/PS06 |
| Promotion-eligibility freeze *logic* | — (raises flag) | PS06 (enforces freeze) |
| Authentication, MFA, SSO, step-up challenge | — (invokes) | Platform §3.1 / P02 |
| Workflow engine primitives (instances, actions, routing, SLA) | **Configure** (W.1) | **P01** WorkflowEngine |
| RBAC model, scoping, field access, PII ceiling | **Reference** | **RBAC v1.7 + P02** |
| Audit substrate (dual-log, DB-trigger, immutability) | **Consume** | **P05** |
| Notification engine, channels, retry, templates | **Configure** (W.3) | **X.2** |
| Org hierarchy / reporting lines used for routing | Read | PS01 / org platform; P01 reporting-chain resolution |

**Boundary note (ADR-PS02-01, see §4.5):** PS02's approval/sensitivity/delegation/e-sign **configuration** is module-agnostic by construction (it is a set of P01 flow definitions + a sensitivity catalog), so **PS05 (transfers), PS06 (promotions), PS09 (penalties)** can later consume the same configured Change-Control pattern. PS02 is the *first enterprise consumer* of the platform's existing sensitive-change pattern — **not** a re-platforming effort.

### 2.4 Assumptions & Constraints (with elevated hard dependency)

- **[HARD GATE — R4/R8/R11] PS01/M01 commit capability.** PS01 (extending PrimeSoft M01) exposes a governed-field metadata read and the **effective-dated** commit path. Per the platform effective-dating mechanism (§3.3; `VAL-EFFECTIVE`; **`JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`** modelled on `JOB-M01-EFFDATE`), mutations to effective-dated fields accept **`effective_from`** and are **staged and applied by the effective-date job, not written live.** Workstream F/G (commit, statutory) **must not start** until this contract — including effective-dated/staged write, version token and idempotency semantics — is **VERIFIED in staging** (§14.5). This is the single most important precondition; it is *tracked*, not assumed-resolved.
- **PS12** exposes an idempotent SR-ledger append (`VAL-PS12-SREVENT`) including a **reversing** event type for break-glass; **the identity/personal-data SR event is posted by PS01 (the master/identity owner, `source_module=PS01`) on commit — PS02 does not post to the ledger** but supplies the change context to PS01 and tracks the resulting posting status; PS12 runs on the **P05** audit/immutability substrate.
- **PS13** (PrimeSoft M11) exposes upload + reference + virus-scan-status APIs (`VAL-FILE`) and an export-artefact store.
- **PS10/PS11/PS06** expose an **acknowledgeable** retro-impact consumer endpoint (or subscribe + post an ACK) so the downstream loop reconciles (FR-PS02-022).
- An **authority-verification provider** exists for UIDAI (Aadhaar), Income-Tax (PAN) and the caste/category certificate portal, integrated via **X.3** with credentials in **`integration_credentials` (P04)**; where a portal is unavailable, the field is HR-verified with recorded manual attestation and flagged.
- All actors are authenticated via the platform session (§3.1: Google SSO / username-password / **MFA TOTP/SMS OTP**); PS02 enforces authorization via **P02** and **invokes step-up** for sensitive initiation. High-privilege statutory roles (Appointing Authority, SR Custodian) require MFA equivalently (§3.1).
- Statutory retention: change requests and their audit retained per **P05** (≥ 7 years; enterprise schedule may be stricter, never below the statutory floor), reconciled against DPDPA erasure (§4.4, §8.1).

## 3. User Roles & Permissions

Roles map to the **RBAC v1.7** taxonomy (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6). PS02 adds **no parallel scheme**: enterprise statutory actors are expressed as **new roles + capability flags ADDED** to the taxonomy (registered in RBAC §2.2/§4.3), and the **Grievance Officer** and **Fraud Reviewer** are **capability flags** on existing roles. **Segregation of duties (maker ≠ checker, no self-approval, multi-role intersection) is enforced by P01/P02**, not re-implemented: `request.created_by ≠ approval.actor`, no actor approves/signs a request they created or that mutates their own master record, and a `delegate` must independently satisfy the stage's required role.

### 3.0 Role mapping to RBAC v1.7 (ADDITIONS)

| PS02 actor (v2 name) | RBAC v1.7 expression | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Employee (Self-Service) | **Employee** (individual access, own-record scope) | RBAC §2.4 |
| Reporting Manager | **Manager L1** (P01 reporting-chain approver resolution; HOD authority is the per-workflow capability toggle) | RBAC §2.3; Platform §P01 |
| HR Officer | **HRBP** (entity-scoped operational) | RBAC §2.2 |
| HR Admin | **HR Administrator (`hr_admin`)** — superset operational role | RBAC §2.2; BRD §3.1.1 |
| Dept Head / Appointing Authority | **HOD** + **new role `Appointing Authority`** (sanctioning authority; P01 approver; SoD by P02) | `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6 |
| SR Custodian / Registrar | **new entity-scoped role + capability flag on the PS12 ledger** (mirrors Document Admin pattern; on P05) | §6.6 |
| Grievance Officer | **capability flag** (RBAC §4.3) on HR Admin / Appointing Authority | §6.4/§6.6 |
| Fraud Reviewer | **capability flag** (RBAC §4.3) on HR Officer / HR Admin / Authority | §6.4/§6.6 |
| Auditor (read-only) | **map to Org-Admin audit read + time-bound read-only entitlement** + **P05 `Audit.query`** access — *not* a parallel write role | §6.6; Platform §P05 |
| System Administrator | **map to Org Admin / Platform Super Admin** — configuration via W.1/W.2; **no transactional self-approval** | §6.6 |

### 3.1 Role-to-capability matrix

| Capability | Employee (Self-Service) | Reporting Manager (Mgr L1) | HR Officer (HRBP) | HR Admin | Dept Head / Appointing Authority | SR Custodian | Auditor | System Admin (Org/Platform Admin) |

Notes: "(config)" = governed by the configured P01 approval flow / capability config (FR-012). "(scope)" = limited to the actor's `org_unit`/`entity_id` data-layer scope. System Admin has **no transactional self-approval** by design (P02). Break-glass reversal requires **two distinct authorisers** (auth 1 ≠ auth 2 ≠ original maker), enforced by P02 SoD.

### 3.2 Authorization principles (all enforced by P02 `Authorization.check`)

1. **Ownership check** — a self-service requester may only target their own `employee_id` (own-record scope).
2. **Scope check** — HR/manager/authority actions are bounded to their `org_unit`/`entity_id` subtree via the **P02 data-scope filter** (data layer).
3. **Status gate** — the request is permitted, blocked, or routed to an elevated path based on the target's PS01/M01 `employment_status` (FR-018).
4. **Sensitivity gate** — the minimum required approver role is derived from the field's sensitivity class via the configured P01 flow / approval matrix.
5. **Step-up gate** — initiating a HIGH/STATUTORY self-service request requires a fresh platform step-up re-authentication (FR-023; §3.1).
6. **SoD invariant** — `request.created_by ≠ approval.actor`, `approval.actor ≠ target.user_id`, and `reversal.auth1 ≠ auth2 ≠ original_maker` at every P01 stage — **enforced by P01/P02 multi-role intersection + deny-by-default**, not re-coded.
7. **Delegation non-elevation** — a **P01 `delegate`** must independently hold the stage's `required_role`; delegation transfers the *action*, never the *privilege* (FR-013).
8. **Least-privilege PII / ceiling** — unmasked sensitive values (bank account, Aadhaar/PAN) are governed by the **PII Protection Ceiling** which **overrides everything upward** and the **field mask applied on serialization** (P02 / RBAC §3.9, §6); every reveal is audited to P05. `E·AR` fields render read-only with a **"Request change"** control (Foundation §3), never a direct write.

## 4. Shared Application Foundation & Cross-Agent Build Instructions

This module **consumes** the PrimeSoft platform contracts by id (`PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`, `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md`); it does not re-author them. The invented `SHARED_FOUNDATION.md` defaults used by v2 are overridden per `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C.

### 4.1 Inherited platform defaults (override the invented v2 defaults)

- **Frontend:** physical stack is an engineering choice within the platform's logical architecture (React/Tailwind/shadcn assumed by the prototype); PS02 specifies behaviour/NFR + the **canonical UI-state standard** (Foundation §3), not the framework.
- **Backend / API:** REST under **`/api/v1`**; **`Idempotency-Key`** on unsafe workflow-initiating POSTs (24h replay); **cursor pagination** (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100, `next_cursor`); **`X-Correlation-Id`** request/response header echoed to every audit/log line; `?sort=field:asc|desc`. Endpoints **never re-implement permission logic — they call `Authorization.check` (P02)**.
- **Auth:** platform session (§3.1) — Google SSO / username-password (one-way hashed) / **MFA (TOTP/SMS OTP)**; bearer JWT carrying **resolved roles + tenant/entity scope** (raw permissions resolved per request by P02). PS02 invokes **step-up** for sensitive initiation.
- **Canonical error envelope:** `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "field": "...", "details": { } } }`; **2xx returns the resource payload**; the correlation id is the **`X-Correlation-Id` header**, *not* a body `requestId`.
- **Standard error codes (Foundation §1, 8-code table):** `VALIDATION_FAILED` (422), `UNAUTHENTICATED` (401), `FORBIDDEN` (403), `NOT_FOUND` (404), `CONFLICT` (409, incl. idempotency replay / duplicate workflow start `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE` / state conflict), `PRECONDITION_FAILED` (412), `RATE_LIMITED` (429), `INTERNAL` (500). **No 503** (upstream failures handled via **X.3** mapping + 500/`ERR-LOADFAIL` or 412 `ERR-PRECOND`). Plus PS02-unique `ERR-PS02-*` (§8.3).
- **Security/compliance:** OWASP/ASVS posture per platform NFR; TLS in transit; encryption at rest; **P05** tamper-evident audit (DB-trigger; OPEN-PLAT-03); **DPDPA** alignment (§4.4, §8.1); statutory retention ≥ 7 yr.
- **NFR baseline (platform §8.2 — overrides invented v2 NFR):** standard API **p95 < 500 ms @ 300 concurrent**; read-heavy p95 < 300 ms cached / < 1000 ms uncached; writes p95 < 1500 ms; **uptime 99.5%/month**; **RTO < 4 h · RPO < 1 h**; 100% audit capture; **WCAG 2.1 AA**; responsive 375/768/1280 px; no hard delete.

### 4.2 Platform services & shared entities consumed (NOT redefined here)

| Service / entity | Owner | How PS02 uses it |
|---|---|---|
| **P01 WorkflowEngine** (`workflows` / `workflow_instances` / `workflow_actions`) | Platform | Every approval/maker-checker flow runs here as a **configured W.1 flow**; `startInstance({workflow_code, subject_ref=change_request_id, context, initiator})`; `advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel/query` (idempotent); patterns from Appendix D; **in-flight version pinning**; SLA & escalation runtime. |
| **P02 `Authorization.check`** | Platform / RBAC v1.7 | Every endpoint calls it for authz, scope filter, field mask; PII ceiling; `E·AR` routing. |
| **P05** (`audit_log` + `security_audit_log`) | Platform | DB-trigger capture of every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE; immutable; ≥7-yr; OPEN-PLAT-03 tamper-evidence; `Audit.query/export` for auditors. |
| **X.1** Background Jobs runner | Platform | Runs `JOB-PS02-*` (idempotent, backoff ×3, JOB-FAIL → MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL, per-tenant isolation). |
| **X.2** Notification Infrastructure | Platform | `IN_APP + EMAIL` parallel for approvals; EMAIL mandatory/non-suppressible for approval & statutory notices; backoff ×5 + DLQ; templates by `MSG-PS02-*`. |
| **X.3** Integration Framework | Platform | Outbound authority-portal/PS12/PS13 calls (circuit-breaking, idempotency, error mapping); credentials from `integration_credentials` (P04). |
| **W.1/W.2/W.3** Configured content | Platform | Approval/flow definitions (W.1), data-collection forms (W.2, `VAL-*` bound), notification config (W.3). |
| `employees` (PS01 / PrimeSoft M01) | PS01/M01 | Read current value + version + `employment_status`; commit approved changes via the effective-dated path (`effective_from`, `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`). |
| `users` / `roles` / `permissions` / `org_units` | Platform / RBAC | Identity, authorization, approver resolution, capability flags, data scope. |
| `documents` | PS13 / PrimeSoft M11 | Store references to supporting documents; read scan/verify status; export artefacts. |
| `service_register_events` | **PS12 (net-new enterprise ledger)** | **Read SR posting status for reconciliation.** On commit of a STATUTORY change, **PS01 (master/identity owner) posts** the identity/personal-data event (`source_module=PS01`, incl. reversing events; idempotent; `VAL-PS12-SREVENT`); **PS02 does not append.** On the **P05 substrate**, not a platform primitive. |
| `notifications` | Platform (X.2) | Outbound in-app/email/SMS, incl. out-of-band data-subject notice. |
| `consent_records` | Platform (P05) | DPDPA consent lifecycle; `VAL-CONSENT`. |
| `integration_credentials` | Platform (P04) | Encrypted credentials for portals/PS12/PS13 integrations. |

### 4.3 Cross-agent build instructions

1. **Do not duplicate PS01/M01 field storage.** Treat the employee master as authoritative; capture only proposed values in `change_request_items` until commit.
2. **Use P01 for all routing.** Each request maps to **one `workflow_instance`** (`subject_ref = change_request_id`, `context` = sensitivity/scope/status). Each approval node is a **`workflow_action`** (not an invented `workflow_task`). PS02-specific approval semantics (sensitivity tier, e-sign reference) are stored in `change_request_approvals` keyed to the `workflow_action`. Configure the flow in **W.1**; never code a bespoke engine.
3. **Idempotency keys:** apply-to-master = `change_request_item_id`; SR posting = `change_request_item_id + ':SR'`; retro event = `change_request_item_id + ':RETRO:' + module`; reversal = `change_request_item_id + ':REV:' + reversal_id`. All workflow-initiating POSTs also send the **`Idempotency-Key`** header (24h replay → original result, not duplicate; duplicate start → 409 `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`).
4. **Transaction boundary & canonical sequence (R15):** committing an approved request applies all items atomically; canonical post-commit sequence is **PS01/M01 effective-dated commit → item `COMMITTED` → (statutory) PS01 posts the identity/personal-data SR event (`source_module=PS01`); PS02 tracks the observed SR status `PENDING`→`POSTED/FAILED` and (retro) retro-event `PENDING`→`ACKED/FAILED`**. SR-status tracking / retro posting is *separate* and never blocks `COMMITTED`. Cross-service commit uses the documented **saga/outbox** (§10.4) since PS01/M01 effective-dating is **staged by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`**.
5. **Configuration is data, not code:** sensitivity classes, approval routes, e-sign method policy, regex, hard-block rules live in `field_sensitivity_catalog` + the configured **W.1 approval flow**; never hard-code field→approver or method→tier. Builders are the **W.1 `cfg-approval-builder` / W.2 `cfg-form-builder`** Org-Admin screens.
6. **Every write path is captured by the P05 DB trigger** (no application-code audit; no API bypass) and emits an **X.2** notification where applicable. No silent state changes.
7. **PII discipline (R18 / PII ceiling):** never log raw old/new values for HIGH/STATUTORY fields; store proposed sensitive values encrypted in `change_request_items`; store Aadhaar only as a **vault token reference** (`vault_token_ref`); P05 stores PII masked; field mask applied **on serialization** by P02.
8. **Field keys bind to the PS01/M01 registry (§5.8):** use `m01_field_key`; model `name` as a **composite** request (`first_name`/`middle_name`/`last_name` sub-items); never invent a single `name` field.
9. **Cite ids, don't restate:** field validation cites **`VAL-*`** (PAN/Aadhaar/IFSC/DOB/EFFECTIVE/DATE/FILE/COMMENT/ENUM/EMAIL/MOBILE/CONSENT/MASTER-UNIQUE); author only module-unique **`VAL-PS02-*`**; notifications use **`MSG-PS02-*`**; errors use shared `ERR-*` + module-unique **`ERR-PS02-*`**; jobs use **`JOB-PS02-*`** — all registered in the Foundation §2/§4/§5 indexes.

### 4.4 DPDPA & Aadhaar data-handling statement (R18 / Improvement 19)

- **Legal basis & retention override:** processing of governed personal data is on the legal basis of the employer–employee statutory relationship and public-sector records law; **statutory retention (≥ 7 yr, enterprise schedule)** overrides DPDPA erasure for the *audit/provenance* record (P05; Platform §P05/§8.1). DPDPA erasure is honoured for non-statutory convenience data and for the unmasked sensitive *value* via **crypto-shred** while preserving the P05 provenance shell; the **right-to-erasure redaction marker on `old_value`** is the only permitted P05 mutation (Platform §P05).
- **Aadhaar tokenisation:** the full Aadhaar number is **never** stored in `change_request_items`; PS02 stores a `vault_token_ref` issued by the platform data vault; last-4 masked form for display; `VAL-AADHAAR` (Verhoeff + masked storage) applies. PAN stored masked; `VAL-PAN`; uniqueness via `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE` on PS01/M01.
- **Key management & crypto-shred:** sensitive `change_request_items` columns encrypted with field-level keys via the platform KMS, rotated; per-record crypto-shred is the erasure mechanism, leaving an auditable tombstone in P05.
- **Consent:** `consent_records` (DPDPA) captured at onboarding, immutable; `VAL-CONSENT`.

### 4.5 ADR-PS02-01 — First enterprise consumer of the platform sensitive-change pattern (R21 / Improvement 20)

**Decision:** Do **not** build a new engine. PS02 is the **first enterprise consumer** of the existing PrimeSoft **"Request change → approval"** sensitive-field pattern (Foundation §3; Platform §P01 caller "M01 sensitive-field change"), expressed as a **configured P01 flow (W.1) + a sensitivity catalog**. The pattern is already module-agnostic; **PS05 (transfers), PS06 (promotions), PS09 (penalties)** are designated future consumers of the same configured Change-Control flow family. This preserves the platform build (no rewrite) while preventing divergent re-implementations. Cost: a sensitivity catalog + the configured flow definitions + capability flags — no engine code.

## 5. Holistic Data Model

### 5.1 Entity inventory

**Module-owned entities (PS02):** v2's E1–E19 are retained, with **E18 (`cr_audit_chain`) removed** — re-grounded onto **P05 dual-log + OPEN-PLAT-03** (no invented audit table). Every table additionally carries **`tenant_id` (NN)** and **`entity_id` (NN where entity-scoped)** per Platform §0.1. Net module-owned entities: **18** (E1–E17, E19).

| ~~E18~~ | ~~`cr_audit_chain`~~ | **REMOVED** | — | **Re-grounded to P05 dual-log (DB-trigger, immutable) + OPEN-PLAT-03 hash-chaining**; PS02 defines no audit table (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C) |
| E19 | `cr_step_up_events` | Step-up re-auth events (platform MFA, §3.1) | Append-only | Invokes platform step-up; +tenancy |

**Platform-provided entities referenced (owned elsewhere — see §4.2):** `workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions` (P01), `audit_log`/`security_audit_log` (P05), `notifications` (X.2), `integration_credentials`/`tenants` (P04), `consent_records` (P05), `users`/`roles`/`org_units` (RBAC), `employees` (PS01/M01), `documents` (PS13/M11), `service_register_events` (PS12 net-new ledger).

| `is_deleted` | BOOLEAN | N | false | |

> **Note — PII tier vs routing sensitivity (recon):** `pii_tier_id` (→ platform `pii_tiers`) is a **DPDPA data-classification** axis and is **orthogonal to `sensitivity`**: it does **not** drive the P01 approval route (that stays derived from `sensitivity` / `field_group` / `field_key` per FR-PS02-002 and the `approval_matrix_rules` precedence). It is a display/grouping and data-governance attribute — the `sensitive-changes` review screen renders and groups requests by PII Tier. Approval-matrix rule resolution is unchanged by this field.

#### ~~E18 — `cr_audit_chain`~~ — REMOVED (re-grounded to P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03)

PS02 defines **no** audit table. Every INSERT/UPDATE/soft-DELETE on every PS02 table above is captured by the **P05 DB trigger** into `audit_log` (data) / `security_audit_log` (auth/permission/admin) — immutable, ≥7-yr, 100% capture, no API bypass (Platform §P05). Tamper-evidence (hash-chaining the audit partitions, chain head → WORM) tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03** — PS02 consumes it rather than inventing a parallel chain (`MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C). The `esignatures` ledger (E10) retains its own hash-chain (a enterprise-specific legal-signature artefact) aligned to the same OPEN-PLAT-03 mechanism.

*Re-grounding notes:* sensitive identity/financial fields are `E·AR` → render the platform **"Request change"** control (Foundation §3); statutory format validation cites the platform **`VAL-*`** ids (never restated); `bank_account_no` strong-method-only e-sign (R1); Aadhaar/PAN/category HR-only + authority-portal (via X.3); `name` decomposed (R9); `dob` hard-block (R11); `gender` `evidence_path` (R12); `field_group` excludes `STATUTORY` (it is a sensitivity, not a group).

### 5.6 Data integrity rules

1. **SoD constraint (P01/P02):** enforced by the platform — `change_request_approvals.assigned_to ≠ change_requests.requested_by` and ≠ target's `user_id`; multi-role intersection + deny-by-default (P02). DB CHECK additionally guards (`VAL-PS02-SOD`); attempted breach → 403 `FORBIDDEN`/`ERR-PS02-SOD`.
2. **Stale-value guard:** at commit, `old_value_hash` must equal SHA-256 of current PS01/M01 value; mismatch → 409 `CONFLICT`/`ERR-PS02-STALE`, request → `RETURNED` (`VAL-PS02-STALEHASH`).
3. **Single-commit invariant:** `commit_idempotency_key` UNIQUE + `Idempotency-Key` header; commit is a no-op if `item_status = COMMITTED`.
4. **Document gate:** request cannot move past `PENDING_DOCS` while any item with `requires_document` lacks a `VERIFIED`+`CLEAN` (PS13) document; `requires_authority_portal_verification` items additionally require `authority_verification_status = VERIFIED`. Unmet → 412 `PRECONDITION_FAILED`/`ERR-PRECOND`.
5. **E-sign gate & method policy:** STATUTORY/FINANCIAL-HIGH approvals require a non-null `esignature_id` whose `sign_method ∈ allowed_esign_methods`; `OTP` forbidden for FINANCIAL/STATUTORY (`VAL-PS02-ESIGN-METHOD`); `PASSWORD_REAUTH` does not exist.
6. **Effective-date rule (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`):** for `CORRECTION`, `effective_from` ≤ original master value date and ≥ DOJ; for `UPDATE`, `effective_from` ≥ today (configurable grace); staged by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE` (§3.3). Disallowed back-date → 422/`ERR-PAST-DATED`.
7. **Sensitivity derivation:** `highest_sensitivity` = MAX of item sensitivities; P01 route derived from this; not user-overridable. **Mixed-request principle:** all-or-nothing at the highest tier present.
8. **FK integrity:** all FKs enforced; no orphans.
9. **Append-only / immutable ledgers:** `change_request_approvals`, `esignatures`, `cr_sla_events`, `cr_risk_signals`, `retro_impact_events`, `cr_reversals`, `data_subject_notices`, `cr_step_up_events`, and PS12 `service_register_events` are append-only. **Audit immutability is P05's** (no UPDATE/DELETE grant; redaction-marker only).
10. **Pagination bound:** all list reads use **cursor paging**, `limit` default 25 / max 100, `next_cursor`.
11. **Commit/SR/retro sequencing (R15):** canonical order **PS01/M01 effective-dated commit → item `COMMITTED` → PS12 SR `PENDING`→`POSTED/FAILED` and retro `PENDING`→`ACKED/FAILED`**. SR/retro tracked separately and **never** gate `COMMITTED`.
12. **Employment-status gate (R3):** request rejected/elevated per `employment_status_at_submit`; self-service blocked for non-`ACTIVE` (`ERR-PS02-STATUSGATE`); deceased bank/nominee → family-pension path (FR-018).
13. **Tamper-evidence (R6):** every audit-relevant write is captured by the **P05 DB trigger**; tamper-evidence via **OPEN-PLAT-03** hash-chaining (chain head → WORM); a periodic verifier (`JOB-PS02-AUDITVERIFY`, consuming the P05/OPEN-PLAT-03 chain) alarms on break.
14. **Statutory hard-block (R11):** an item whose `hard_block_rule_ref` evaluates true (DOB pre-retirement) is blocked → 412 `PRECONDITION_FAILED`/`ERR-PS02-HARDBLOCK`; divertible only to the legal-process path (`VAL-PS02-HARDBLOCK`).
15. **Identity tokenisation (R18):** `tokenize_in_vault=true` items carry `vault_token_ref`; raw value never in `new_value`/`old_value`; P05 stores PII masked.
16. **Auth-bearing reclassification (R1):** `is_auth_bearing=true` ⇒ `sensitivity ≥ MEDIUM` and `auto_apply_on_low=false` (config-save validation, `VAL-PS02-AUTHBEAR`).
17. **Reversal dual-auth (R13):** `auth1 ≠ auth2 ≠ original maker` (CHECK + P02 SoD; `VAL-PS02-DUALAUTH`).
18. **Regex safety (R17):** admin module-unique `validation_regex` length/complexity-bounded + safe-regex compile + timeout (`VAL-PS02-REGEXSAFE`); statutory formats use platform `VAL-*` (never re-authored).
19. **Config validation on save (§3.2):** W.1/W.2 configs are versioned and validated on save (no circular stage — `VAL-FLOW-NOCYCLE`; assignee resolvable; SLA defined); in-flight instances pin their version (P01).

### 5.8 Field-Key Registry (PS02 catalog → PS01/M01 master) — Improvement 10 / R9

Binds every PS02 catalog `field_key` to the **actual** PS01/M01 master key. Build agents MUST use `m01_field_key` for the effective-dated commit; the legacy v1 single `name`/`category_caste`/`national_id` keys are corrected here.

| PS02 catalog `field_key` | v1 (wrong) key | PS01/M01 canonical `m01_field_key` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `first_name` | part of `name` | `employees.first_name` | Composite parent `name` expands to first/middle/last |
| `middle_name` | part of `name` | `employees.middle_name` | Nullable; supports `clear_intent` |
| `last_name` | part of `name` | `employees.last_name` | |
| `dob` | `dob` | `employees.dob` | Effective-dated (`JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`); hard-block applies; `VAL-DOB` |
| `gender` | `gender` | `employees.gender` | `evidence_path` distinguishes data-error vs dignity recognition |
| `category` (social category) | `category_caste` | `employees.category` (GEN/OBC/SC/ST/EWS) | NOT `cadre` (a service attribute owned by PS06) |
| `national_id` (Aadhaar) | `national_id` | `employees.national_id` + `employee_identity_documents(AADHAAR)` | Vault-tokenised; HR-only; `VAL-AADHAAR` |
| `pan` | (absent) | `employees.pan` + `employee_identity_documents(PAN)` | `VAL-MASTER-UNIQUE` on PS01; HR-only; `VAL-PAN` |
| `bank_account_no` | `bank_account_no` | `employee_bank_accounts.account_number` | Effective-dated; `VAL-IFSC` for branch |
| `correspondence_address`/`permanent_address` | same | `employee_addresses(<type>)` | Effective-dated address rows |
| `email`/`primary_phone`/`alternate_phone` | `alternate_phone` only | `employee_contacts.<field>` | Auth-bearing → MEDIUM + notify old; `VAL-EMAIL`/`VAL-MOBILE` |

**Note on `cadre`:** v1's `category_caste` conflated social/reservation category with service cadre. v3 maps personal-detail caste/category to `employees.category` and excludes `cadre` (service-cadre changes are PS05/PS06 events, out of PS02 scope).

### FR-PS02-001 — Create & Submit a Personal-Details Change Request

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Self-Service), HR Officer/HRBP (on behalf)
- **User Story:** *As an employee, I want to request a change to my personal details with a clear before/after preview and supporting documents, so that my record is updated accurately and with proper approval.*

**Description:** Provides the guided **W.2 form** to create a `change_requests` header and `change_request_items`. The form is scoped by **P02 `Authorization.check`** (ownership/scope/field access + `self_service_editable` + **employment-status gate, FR-018**). On selecting an `E·AR` field the platform renders the **"Request change"** control (Foundation §3) — never a direct write. Current master value is fetched read-only ("before"); the requester supplies the "new" value (or `clear_intent`), reason, change type and `effective_from`. **Composite `name` expands to sub-items.** On submit, the system computes `highest_sensitivity`, evaluates **fraud signals (FR-019)**, requires **step-up (FR-023) for HIGH/STATUTORY self-service**, and calls **`WorkflowEngine.startInstance({workflow_code, subject_ref=change_request_id, context, initiator})`** (◆) to bind the P01 instance, transitioning to `SUBMITTED`/`PENDING_DOCS` (or `NOTICE_HOLD` for HR_ON_BEHALF pending data-subject notice).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Requester can only add fields P02 authorises on the target; `self_service_editable=false` fields (Aadhaar/PAN/category) are not selectable in self-service.
2. For each item the current master value is stored as `old_value` + `old_value_hash`; tokenised fields store only `vault_token_ref` + masked form.
3. Submission rejected with **422 `VALIDATION_FAILED`** if a cited `VAL-*` fails, the effective-date rule (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`) is violated, a required document type is missing, or `new_value` is null without `clear_intent` (`VAL-PS02-CLEARINTENT`).
4. On valid submit, exactly **one P01 `workflow_instance`** is created (`startInstance`); a duplicate open change → **409 `CONFLICT`/`ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`**. Status becomes `SUBMITTED`/`PENDING_DOCS` (or `NOTICE_HOLD`).
5. **Employment-status gate:** self-service blocked (**403 `FORBIDDEN`/`ERR-PS02-STATUSGATE`**) for non-`ACTIVE`; HR-on-behalf routes to the elevated path (FR-018).
6. A `cr_number` is generated; **P05** captures the mutation (DB trigger); an **X.2** requester confirmation (IN_APP+EMAIL) is dispatched (`MSG-PS02-SUBMITTED`).
7. **Step-up gate:** initiating HIGH/STATUTORY self-service without a valid unexpired `cr_step_up_events.SUCCESS` → **412 `PRECONDITION_FAILED`/`ERR-PS02-STEPUP`**.
8. Drafts can be saved without routing and resumed.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: A self-service requester's `target_employee_id` must equal their own employee record (P02 own-record scope).
- BR2: HR-on-behalf requires the target within the requester's `entity_id`/`org_unit` scope **and triggers a data-subject notice (FR-017)**.
- BR3: `highest_sensitivity` is system-derived; the P01 route is not user-editable.
- BR4: One open change per field per employee across concurrent non-terminal requests → 409 `CONFLICT`.
- BR5: The request snapshots `employment_status_at_submit`; status gating (FR-018) and step-up (FR-023) precede `startInstance`.

### FR-PS02-002 — Field Sensitivity Classification & P01 Approval Routing

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System (configured P01 flow); configured by System Admin (FR-012)
- **User Story:** *As the HR governance owner, I want each request routed automatically based on the sensitivity of the fields it touches, so that sensitive changes get the right scrutiny without manual routing.*

**Description:** The **configured P01 flow (W.1)** + `field_sensitivity_catalog` deterministically map a request's items and the active `approval_matrix_config` (org-scope **and `employment_status` scope**) to an ordered set of P01 stages, persisted as `change_request_approvals` keyed to **`workflow_actions`** (◆). It resolves highest sensitivity, applies field/group/change-type/status overrides, attaches **P01 `sla_definition`** + escalation, and marks LOW items auto-apply **only where the field is not `is_auth_bearing`**. P01 patterns used: `SEQUENTIAL`, `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` (all-required), `PARALLEL_ANY_OF` (any-one), `CONDITIONAL` (fraud-node injection), `DYNAMIC_APPROVER` (runtime approver set) (◆).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given items {LOW, HIGH}, the route reflects HIGH (highest wins).
2. Active matrix selected by org-scope precedence (most specific first, else entity/global); `employment_status` scope overrides apply for non-ACTIVE.
3. Sequential stages execute in `level_no` order; `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` joins only when every branch completes; `PARALLEL_ANY_OF` completes on first approval and cancels losing branches (P01 mechanics) (◆).
4. Each stage persists `required_role`, `sla_hours`, `escalation_role` (P01 `sla_definition`).
5. LOW items with `auto_apply_on_low=true`, no documents, **and `is_auth_bearing=false`** skip approval and commit straight away (P05 still captures); **auth-bearing contact fields never auto-apply**.
6. The route is idempotent for a given request version; **in-flight instances pin the workflow definition version** (P01) (◆).
7. When `highest_sensitivity` is HIGH+ and `risk_band=HIGH/BLOCKED` (FR-019), a **`CONDITIONAL`** P01 stage injects a mandatory fraud-review node (◆).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Field-key override > field-group override > sensitivity default.
- BR2: STATUTORY always includes a SANCTION stage + strong e-signature.
- BR3: A request mixing CORRECTION + statutory field always routes to senior sanction (mixed-request principle, §5.6 rule 7).
- BR4: DECEASED/RETIRED routes always include the elevated authority stage (FR-018).
- BR5: Auth-bearing contact changes require at least one human APPROVE stage and a notify-old-value side-effect (FR-017); `auto_apply_on_low` is force-disabled at config (`VAL-PS02-AUTHBEAR`).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `approval_matrix_config`/`_rules` | READ | route definition incl. employment_status_scope, workflow_code |
| `field_sensitivity_catalog` | READ | per-field sensitivity, is_auth_bearing |

|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/route-preview` | Preview computed P01 route (no persist) |
| (internal) | `WorkflowEngine.startInstance` / stage resolution | Persisted on submit ◆ |

**UI Behavior Notes:** "How this will be reviewed" panel shows the computed P01 stage chain (roles, order, SLA), a fraud-review badge when risk is high, and an elevated-path badge for non-ACTIVE targets.

**Edge Cases:** No active matrix for scope (fallback to entity/global; if none → **500 `INTERNAL`** + config alert); circular stage (rejected at config save, `VAL-FLOW-NOCYCLE`); delegated approver unavailable (P01 escalation); auth-bearing field with mistakenly-enabled auto-apply (config rejects, `VAL-PS02-AUTHBEAR`).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `RoutePreviewPanel` renders P01 stage chain, fraud/elevated badges. |
| Backend-Service Flow | Routing resolved by the **configured P01 flow**: load active matrix (scope + status precedence) → collect rules with override precedence → inject fraud-review (`CONDITIONAL`) if high risk → dedupe + order → create approval rows keyed to `workflow_actions` ◆. |
| Data Operations | READ matrix/rules/catalog; INSERT approvals; P01 instance/action rows; UPDATE highest_sensitivity, sla_due_at. |
| Validation Logic | ≥1 stage for non-auto-apply; role keys exist (RBAC); no duplicate level; auth-bearing auto-apply forbidden. |
| Authorization Logic | Engine internal; route-preview limited to requester/reviewers (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Creates pending P01 actions; sets first SLA; emits `SLA_SET`. |
| Failure Handling | Missing matrix → fallback + alert; invalid rule → 500 `INTERNAL` + admin notify, request stays SUBMITTED unrouted. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | **P01**; FR-012 config; FR-018/019; consumed by FR-001/004. |
| Test Guidance | Highest-wins; scope + status precedence; `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`/`ANY_OF`; auto-apply LOW non-auth-bearing only; fraud-node injection; override precedence; in-flight version pinning. |

### FR-PS02-003 — Supporting-Document & Authority-Portal Verification

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee/HR (upload); HR Officer (verify); HR/authority (authority-portal verification)
- **User Story:** *As a reviewer, I want every sensitive change backed by verified documentary proof — and, for caste/identity, by an authority-portal check — so that I can approve confidently and defensibly.*

**Description:** Lets requesters attach documents (stored in **PS13/M11**) to a request/item (`VAL-FILE`), records `doc_type`, mirrors PS13 antivirus `scan_status`, and lets reviewers mark each document `VERIFIED`/`REJECTED`. For `requires_authority_portal_verification=true` items (Aadhaar/PAN/category), the reviewer completes an **authority-portal verification** (UIDAI/Income-Tax/caste portal) **via X.3** (credentials from `integration_credentials`/P04), recording `authority_portal_ref` + `authority_verification_status`. A request with any document/portal-gated item cannot advance past `PENDING_DOCS`/`VERIFY` until all are `VERIFIED`+`CLEAN` (portal `VERIFIED`).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Upload returns a `document_id` from PS13 and creates a `change_request_documents` link (`scan_status=PENDING`).
2. Infected files (`INFECTED`) blocked, flagged, excluded.
3. Reviewer can set `VERIFIED`/`REJECTED` with a reason; both captured by **P05**.
4. The document gate (rule 4) and **authority-portal gate** enforced at approval time → unmet returns **412 `PRECONDITION_FAILED`/`ERR-PRECOND`** (and `ERR-PS02-AUTHPORTAL` for portal).
5. Allowed `doc_type`s constrained to the field's `required_doc_types`.
6. Caste/category verification requires a successful authority-portal result + a structured evidence-to-value attestation; failure → `RETURNED`.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Only HR/authority roles may verify (P02); requesters cannot self-verify.
- BR2: A rejected document returns the request to the requester (`RETURNED`) with reason (`ERR-REASON-REQ`).
- BR3: Documents are referenced, never copied — PS13 is the store of record.
- BR4: Aadhaar/PAN changes are HR-only (self-service blocked) and require authority-portal re-verification (R5).
- BR5: A successful caste/category verification raises a promotion-eligibility freeze flag to **PS06** (FR-008/§8.6) until finalised.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_request_documents` | INSERT/UPDATE | doc_type, verification_status, authority_portal_ref, authority_verification_status, scan_status |
| `documents` (PS13/M11) | READ | scan status, metadata |
| `integration_credentials` (P04) | READ | portal credentials (via X.3) |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/documents` | Link uploaded doc |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/documents/{docId}/verify` | Verify/reject |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/documents/{docId}/authority-verify` | Trigger/record authority-portal verification (X.3) |
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/documents` | List with status (cursor) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Drag-and-drop upload with doc-type selector restricted by field; status chips (Pending scan / Clean / Infected / Verified / Rejected / Portal-Verified); reviewer side-panel preview next to diff; authority-portal verification panel with attestation checkbox.

**Edge Cases:** PS13 upload failure (X.3 retry → 412/`ERR-PRECOND`); scan stuck PENDING (verify blocked; SLA paused); document deleted in PS13 (link broken, blocks approval); authority portal down (X.3 circuit-break; verification PENDING; SLA paused; manual fallback attestation recorded).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `DocumentUploader`, `DocumentVerifyPanel`, `AuthorityPortalVerifyPanel`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `DocumentService.link()` → PS13 upload ref + scan poll; `verify()` updates status (P05 captures); `authorityVerify()` calls provider via **X.3**, records ref/status; gate checked by approval service. |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE change_request_documents; READ PS13; X.3 call; P05 capture. |
| Validation Logic | doc_type ∈ required_doc_types; scan CLEAN to verify; verifier role (P02); non-self-verify; portal result for portal-required items. |
| Authorization Logic | Upload: requester/HR; Verify/authority-verify: HR/authority within scope (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | All required docs+portal VERIFIED unblocks gate; caste verify raises PS06 freeze; rejection → RETURNED. |
| Failure Handling | Upload/scan/portal failures via X.3 retry/circuit-break; broken reference blocks approval. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | PS13 APIs; X.3 + authority providers; gate consumed by FR-004; rejection shares FR-006; freeze to PS06. |
| Test Guidance | Infected block; reject→return; wrong doc_type; portal verify pass/fail; caste freeze raised; PS13/portal timeout. |

### FR-PS02-004 — Maker-Checker Multi-Level Approval (P01 Sequential & Parallel)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Reporting Manager (Mgr L1), HR Officer (HRBP), HR Admin, Dept Head / Appointing Authority
- **User Story:** *As an approver, I want a clear task queue of requests awaiting my decision with the full diff and evidence, so that I can approve, reject, or return them with proper segregation of duties.*

**Description:** Drives requests through **P01** stages. Approvers act via **`WorkflowEngine.approve/reject/sendBack`** (each idempotent — a double-clicked approve produces one `workflow_actions` row, not two) (◆); PS02 records the decision in `change_request_approvals`. Supports recommend→approve→sanction chains, sequential progression, `PARALLEL_ALL_OF`/`PARALLEL_ANY_OF` topologies, and **SoD enforced by P02** (including delegate role-independence). A request reaches `APPROVED` only when all required stages approve; any rejection → `REJECTED`; a sendBack → `RETURNED`. A high-risk request (FR-019) must clear the injected fraud-review stage before substantive approval.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. An approver sees only P01 actions assigned to their role/scope (or validly delegated) in their **Workspace** queue (Foundation §6.5; routed to exactly one workspace).
2. `approve` advances to the next stage or completes the route; the maker/target can never approve (**P02 SoD**).
3. `reject` requires a comment (`ERR-REASON-REQ`) and terminates the request (`REJECTED`).
4. `sendBack` requires a comment and sends the request to `RETURNED` (P01 re-routes to the prior stage).
5. `PARALLEL_ALL_OF` completes only when every branch approves; `PARALLEL_ANY_OF` completes on first approval and cancels losing branches (P01 mechanics) (◆).
6. STATUTORY and FINANCIAL-HIGH stages require a valid strong e-signature (FR-015) whose method ∈ policy before the decision is accepted (412 `ERR-PS02-ESIGN` / 422 `ERR-PS02-ESIGN-METHOD`).
7. A P01 `delegate` acting on a stage must independently hold the stage's `required_role` (`delegate_holds_role_verified=true`, P02-verified), else **403 `FORBIDDEN`/`ERR-PS02-SOD`**.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: `assigned_to ≠ requested_by` and `≠ target user` at every stage (P02 SoD).
- BR2: Comments mandatory on REJECT and RETURN.
- BR3: A stage may be acted on by the assignee or a role-qualified active delegate (P01 `delegate`); both recorded.
- BR4: Decisions are append-only; a terminal P01 action cannot be re-decided (idempotent advance).
- BR5: Every decision is captured by **P05** (DB trigger; OPEN-PLAT-03 chain).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_request_approvals` | INSERT/UPDATE | decision, comment, esignature_id, delegated_from, workflow_action_id ◆ |
| `workflow_actions` (P01) | INSERT | one row per action (idempotent) ◆ |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | status transitions |
| `esignatures` | READ | strong-method gate |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/approvals/queue` | My pending P01 actions (cursor) |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/approvals/{nodeId}/decide` | approve/reject/sendBack (P01) |
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}` | Full request + diff for review |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Approver Workspace (Me / My Team / Admin per Foundation §6.5): left = task queue with SLA countdown + sensitivity + risk badge; right = diff, evidence preview, prior decisions trail, fraud-signal panel; sticky action bar (**Approve / Send-back / Reject**, labels per P01 stage aliases) with mandatory comment on negative actions and strong-e-sign prompt. P01 bulk queue actions supported on high-volume queues (per-row partial failures reported).

**Edge Cases:** Concurrent decisions on a parallel stage (P01 idempotent, first wins); approver loses role mid-flow (P01 escalation/reassign); delegate and delegator both act (P01 idempotent, first persisted); items changed after partial approvals (re-route; prior approvals invalidated, P05 captured); delegate lacks role (403 `ERR-PS02-SOD`).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `ApprovalQueue`, `ApprovalDetail` (diff + evidence + history + risk), `DecisionBar`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `ApprovalService.decide()`: **P02** SoD + delegate-role check → fraud-stage-clearance check → e-sign strong-method check → **`WorkflowEngine.approve/reject/sendBack`** ◆ → persist approval → recompute route → set status. |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE approvals; P01 `workflow_actions` (idempotent); UPDATE status; P05 capture; X.2 notify. |
| Validation Logic | P02 SoD, delegate role-independence, mandatory comments, e-sign presence/method/hash, action-not-terminal, delegate window. |
| Authorization Logic | `Authorization.check` — assignee or role-qualified active delegate; reject self/target. |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Advances stages; full approval → `APPROVED` (triggers FR-010); reject → `REJECTED`; sendBack → `RETURNED`. |
| Failure Handling | Concurrency via P01 idempotency → 409 `CONFLICT` for late actor; engine error keeps action PENDING. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | **P01** approve/reject/sendBack/delegate; **P02**; e-sign (015), delegation (013), commit (010), fraud (019). |
| Test Guidance | SoD block; delegate role-independence; sequential/parallel; strong-e-sign enforcement; fraud-stage gating; concurrent decide idempotency. |

### FR-PS02-005 — Field-Level Change Diff, Preview & Reviewer Comparison

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** All (requester preview; reviewer comparison; auditor read)
- **User Story:** *As a reviewer, I want to see exactly what is changing — old vs new, per field — so that I can judge the change accurately.*

**Description:** Computes and renders a structured before/after diff per item, **masking sensitive values via P02 field-mask-on-serialization** (bank/Aadhaar/PAN masked except to roles whose PII ceiling permits), highlighting changes, and surfacing reason, change type, `effective_from`, **clear-intent** and evidence. The diff is the canonical representation used in approval, audit and history.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Each item shows `old_value` (read-only snapshot) and `new_value` with change highlighting; a cleared field renders "→ (cleared)".
2. HIGH/STATUTORY/IDENTITY values masked for roles below the PII ceiling (**P02 serialization mask** — an over-broad query still cannot leak); Aadhaar shown last-4 (vault-backed).
3. The diff is immutable after submission and recomputed only on return+edit.
4. Auditor can view the historical diff for any committed/decided request (P05-scoped).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Masking format consistent (`XXXX1234`) and never logs the unmasked value.
- BR2: Typed rendering (e.g., `21-May-1990 → 12-May-1990`).
- BR3: Reveal of an unmasked sensitive value is itself captured by **P05** (reading audit/PII is an audited action).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_request_items` | READ | old/new value, datatype, sensitivity, clear_intent |
| `field_sensitivity_catalog` | READ | masking/datatype/tokenisation/rbac_field_access |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/diff` | P02-aware diff payload (field_mask applied) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Diff cards per field with color-coded old (strike) vs new (accent); typed formatting; cleared-field indicator; mask toggle for permitted roles with P05-audited reveal; effective-date and change-type chips. Masked-own-view: the record owner sees Tier-1 IDs masked on screen (Foundation §3).

**Edge Cases:** Multi-line/JSON fields (structured diff); identical old==new with no clear-intent (blocked at submit as no-op); unauthorized reveal attempt (403 `FORBIDDEN`, P05-audited); tokenised field reveal (vault detokenise, P05-audited).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `DiffCard`, `MaskToggle`, cleared-field badge. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `DiffService.render(request, actor)`: load items → **`Authorization.check` field_mask** → detokenise via vault only for permitted reveal → format by datatype. |
| Data Operations | READ items + catalog; P05 capture on sensitive reveal. |
| Validation Logic | old≠new or clear_intent at submit; datatype-aware formatting. |
| Authorization Logic | P02 field mask on serialization gates unmasking; vault detokenise scoped. |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Read-only + P05 access capture. |
| Failure Handling | Decrypt/detokenise failure → masked fallback + error flag. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | **P02**; consumed by FR-001/004/016. |
| Test Guidance | Masking by PII ceiling; typed diff; cleared-field; reveal audit; no-op block; vault detokenise. |

### FR-PS02-006 — Rejection, Return-for-Correction, Resubmission & Withdrawal

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Approvers (reject/sendBack); Requester (resubmit/withdraw)
- **User Story:** *As a requester, when my request is sent back, I want to see why and fix it without re-keying everything, so that I can resubmit quickly.*

**Description:** Manages negative/terminal paths via P01. **Reject** terminates with a mandatory reason. **Return-for-correction** uses **P01 `sendBack`** to an editable `RETURNED` state preserving items/documents/decision-trail; resubmission re-runs validation/routing (P01 re-triggers only the affected stages). **Withdraw** uses **P01 `cancel`** (initiator recall) on a non-terminal request. A data-subject objection (FR-021) can drive a request to `OBJECTED`/paused.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Reject and sendBack require a comment captured in `change_request_approvals.decision_comment` + P05 (`ERR-REASON-REQ`).
2. A `RETURNED` request is editable; prior approvals preserved as history; **P01 send-back re-routes** and re-triggers affected stages on resubmit.
3. Resubmission re-validates `VAL-*`, doc/portal gate, `VAL-EFFECTIVE`, **status gate, step-up**, and re-derives the route.
4. Requester can withdraw any request in `DRAFT`/`SUBMITTED`/`PENDING_DOCS`/`RETURNED`/`IN_REVIEW`/`NOTICE_HOLD` (→ `WITHDRAWN`, P01 `cancel`), not after `APPROVED`.
5. All transitions notify relevant parties via X.2 (incl. data subject for HR-initiated).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Once `APPROVED`/`COMMITTED`, only a new corrective request or a **reversal (FR-020)** can alter the field.
- BR2: Resubmit keeps the same `cr_number` and increments an internal revision counter.
- BR3: Withdrawal cancels outstanding P01 actions (`cancel`) and stops SLA timers.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | status, revision |
| `change_request_approvals` | INSERT | RETURNED/REJECTED decisions |
| `workflow_actions` (P01) | UPDATE/cancel | on withdraw ◆ |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/withdraw` | Requester cancels (P01 `cancel`) |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/resubmit` | After correction (P01 re-trigger) |
| (decide endpoint handles reject/sendBack) | — | FR-004 |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Returned requests appear in the requester's "Action needed" Tasks list with the reviewer's reason banner; edited fields highlighted; one-click resubmit after fixing.

**Edge Cases:** Resubmit after sensitivity changed by config (new route on a new pinned version); withdraw race with in-flight approval (409 `CONFLICT`, latest wins); return after parallel partial approval (P01 resets affected stages); resubmit when target now non-ACTIVE (re-gate).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `ReturnedRequestBanner`, `ResubmitButton`, `WithdrawDialog`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `LifecycleService.return()/reject()/withdraw()/resubmit()` → **P01 `sendBack`/`reject`/`cancel`** ◆; re-gate + re-route on resubmit. |

| Validation Logic | Transition legality (§10); mandatory comment; ownership (P02); re-gate on resubmit. |
| Authorization Logic | Reject/sendBack: current-stage approver; withdraw/resubmit: requester (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | `RETURNED`→`SUBMITTED`; `*`→`WITHDRAWN`; `*`→`REJECTED`. |
| Failure Handling | Illegal transition → 409 `CONFLICT`; P01 cancel failure rolled back. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | **P01** sendBack/cancel; routing (002), approvals (004), SLA (007), notifications (011), objection (021). |

### FR-PS02-007 — SLA Tracking, Reminders & Escalation (P01 SLA Runtime)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System (P01 SLA runtime); escalation targets (HR Admin, Appointing Authority)
- **User Story:** *As an HR governance owner, I want pending approvals tracked against SLAs and auto-escalated when overdue, so that requests never silently stall.*

**Description:** Uses the **P01 per-stage SLA runtime** (`sla_definition` from the configured W.1 flow / `approval_matrix_rules.sla_hours`): on breach the engine emits an escalation event → **X.2** notification + **P05** audit, applying the configured breach output (delegate/auto-act). PS02 mirrors milestones in `cr_sla_events` and runs `JOB-PS02-SLA` (X.1 runner) for reminder cadence. Business-calendar aware (calendar-day fallback for P1). Timers pause when `RETURNED`, awaiting document/portal scan, or `NOTICE_HOLD`/objection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On entering a P01 stage, `sla_due_at` is set from the stage `sla_definition` (business-calendar; excludes holidays/weekends per config).
2. A reminder fires at configurable thresholds (default 50%/90%) via `JOB-PS02-SLA` (X.1).
3. On breach, P01 records a `BREACHED` event and sends an escalation notification (X.2; EMAIL mandatory).
4. If the breach output is auto-reassign, P01 updates the assignee and `REASSIGNED` is recorded.
5. SLA pauses in `RETURNED`/`PENDING_DOCS(scan/portal pending)`/`NOTICE_HOLD`/objection and resumes correctly.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: SLA is per stage; request `sla_due_at` reflects the current active stage.
- BR2: Escalation does not skip required approvals; it changes who acts, not the route.
- BR3: Breach does not auto-approve — manual decision always required.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `cr_sla_events` | INSERT | event_type, due_at, escalated_to (mirror of P01 SLA) |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | sla_due_at |
| `workflow_actions` (P01) | UPDATE | reassignment ◆ |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/sla` | SLA timeline |
| (job) | `JOB-PS02-SLA` (X.1) | Periodic reminder/escalation evaluation |

**UI Behavior Notes:** SLA countdown chips (green/amber/red) in queues; "Overdue" filter; escalation banner on detail; aging report tile in HR dashboard (PS14).

**Edge Cases:** No escalation-role holders (notify HR Admin fallback); clock skew (server-authoritative time); withdrawn mid-SLA (P01 timers stopped); DST/holiday-calendar changes (recompute remaining only); calendar service down in P1 (calendar-day fallback).

### FR-PS02-008 — Correction vs. Update, Effective-Dating, DOB Hard-Block, Caste & Dignity-Aware Gender

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Requester, Approvers
- **User Story:** *As HR, I need to distinguish fixing an error from recording a genuine change — and to enforce public-sector statutory rules for DOB, caste and gender — so that downstream history, seniority and pension stay correct and lawful.*

**Description:** Enforces: a **CORRECTION** repairs an erroneous historical value (effective from the original date, raising tracked retro impact via FR-022); an **UPDATE** records a forward change. Effective-dating reuses the platform mechanism (**`VAL-EFFECTIVE`**; `effective_from` staged by **`JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`**, §3.3). DOB alteration within a configurable pre-retirement window is a **hard-block** (`VAL-PS02-HARDBLOCK` → 412 `ERR-PS02-HARDBLOCK`) divertible only to a separate legal-process path. Caste/category corrections require authority-portal verification (FR-003) and raise a **PS06** freeze. Gender changes follow an `evidence_path` distinguishing a *data-error correction* from *gender-identity recognition* (NALSA / Transgender Persons Act 2019 — privacy-protected, non-gazette).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Requester must choose CORRECTION or UPDATE; the effective-date picker is constrained (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`: correction ≤ original date and ≥ DOJ; update ≥ today−grace; disallowed → 422 `ERR-PAST-DATED`).
2. A CORRECTION on a STATUTORY field forces evidence + strong e-sign + senior sanction route.
3. Corrections set a tracked retro event (FR-022) for fields affecting pay/seniority/pension.
4. The `effective_from` is staged to PS01/M01 on commit and included in any PS12 SR event.
5. **DOB hard-block:** if `DOB_PRE_RETIREMENT_BAR` evaluates true, the standard route is blocked (`ERR-PS02-HARDBLOCK`); only the legal-process path (special elevated authority) may proceed.
6. **Caste/category:** changes require authority-portal verification (FR-003 BR5) and raise a **PS06** promotion-eligibility freeze pending finalisation.
7. **Gender:** the request selects an `evidence_path`; the identity-recognition path uses dignity-aware, privacy-protected evidence (no gazette) with P02-restricted rationale visibility.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: CORRECTION cannot have a future effective date; UPDATE cannot back-date beyond grace (`VAL-EFFECTIVE`).
- BR2: DOB alteration is **hard-blocked** (not flagged) when the rule triggers; override requires the documented legal process.
- BR3: Effective-dating never alters P05 audit timestamps (recorded vs effective).
- BR4: Caste/category freeze on PS06 persists until verification `VERIFIED` and sanction completes.
- BR5: Gender identity-recognition evidence is SENSITIVE; access masked (P02) and audited (P05); never gazette-published by default.

**UI Behavior Notes:** "Correct an error" vs "Record a change" toggle with help; retro-impact warning banner; bounded effective-date picker; DOB hard-block notice with legal-process explainer; dignity-aware gender path selector with privacy notice.

**Edge Cases:** Correction predating DOJ (block); update on a non-working day (allowed); reclassification correction→update after return (re-route); DOB within bar window (hard-block); caste portal pending (freeze stays).

### FR-PS02-009 — Bulk HR-Initiated Corrections

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer / HR Admin (initiate); HR Admin / Appointing Authority (approve)
- **User Story:** *As an HR admin doing a mass data cleanup, I want to upload many corrections at once with validation and a single approval, so that I can fix records efficiently without bypassing governance.*

**Description:** Controlled batch path: HR uploads a CSV/XLSX (`VAL-FILE`), the system performs a **dry-run validation** (existence, P02 scope, cited `VAL-*`, sensitivity, **employment-status gate**, one-open-change, stale checks, **identity/Aadhaar HR-only & portal rules**), produces a valid/invalid report, generates child `change_requests`, **triggers a data-subject notice per affected employee (FR-017)**, and routes for **aggregate approval as a P01 instance**. Approval commits valid rows individually & idempotently (P01 bulk queue actions; per-row partial failures reported — `PARTIAL_FAILED`). *(Re-phased to P4 — §13.3.)*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Upload parses and reports `total/valid/invalid` with row-level reasons.
2. Only rows including required evidence (and portal-required ones flagged) pass validation.
3. The batch routes to an aggregate P01 approval stage honoring the highest sensitivity in the batch.
4. On approval, valid rows commit individually and idempotently; failures recorded per row; batch → `COMMITTED`/`PARTIAL_FAILED` (P01 per-row partial failure, not wholesale).
5. STATUTORY rows trigger a **PS01-posted** SR event individually (`source_module=PS01`; tracked via FR-011) and raise retro events (FR-022).
6. Full audit at batch and row level via **P05**.
7. Each affected employee receives an out-of-band data-subject notice (FR-017, X.2); FINANCIAL rows respect the objection window before downstream credit.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Bulk is HR-only; never self-service.
- BR2: A row failing scope/ownership/status is rejected, not silently skipped.
- BR3: Batch approval respects SoD (P02; approver ≠ initiator).
- BR4: Bulk corrections default `change_type=CORRECTION` unless the row specifies `UPDATE`.
- BR5: Rows changing Aadhaar/PAN/category require portal verification before commit; rows on non-ACTIVE employees route to the elevated path.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `bulk_correction_batches` | INSERT/UPDATE | status, counts, report ref |
| `change_requests`/`_items` | INSERT | child rows, employment_status_at_submit |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Upload wizard with template download; validation grid (filter valid/invalid, inline reasons, portal-required & non-ACTIVE flags); sensitivity summary; approve screen with per-row preview; post-commit results with downloadable report.

**Edge Cases:** Mixed valid/invalid (only valid proceed); duplicate field per employee (409 `CONFLICT`); very large file (chunked async via X.1 worker, P4); evidence ref pointing to another employee's doc (rejected); non-ACTIVE employee row (elevated path).

### FR-PS02-010 — Apply Approved Change to Employee Master (PS01/M01 Effective-Dated Commit)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System (post-approval)
- **User Story:** *As the system, once a change is fully approved, I want to apply it to the employee master with stale-value protection, so that the golden record is updated exactly once and correctly.*

**Description:** On `APPROVED`, the commit service applies each approved item to **PS01/M01 via the effective-dated path** — the change carries **`effective_from`** and is **staged and applied by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`, not written live** (§3.3; ◆) — guarded by `old_value_hash` stale-detection and an idempotency key. All items commit atomically (all-or-nothing). Per the corrected sequence (§5.6 rule 11): on success items become `COMMITTED` and the request `COMMITTED`; STATUTORY items then enqueue **PS12** SR posting (FR-011) and retro-impacting items enqueue retro events (FR-022) — **neither blocks `COMMITTED`**. For HR-initiated FINANCIAL changes, the **first downstream credit is held until the data-subject objection window elapses (FR-017)**. Saga/outbox (§10.4) guarantees eventual consistency given the staged effective-date apply.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Commit applies only `APPROVED` items, using `commit_idempotency_key` + `Idempotency-Key` so re-runs are no-ops.
2. If any item's `old_value_hash` ≠ current PS01/M01 hash, commit aborts that request with **409 `CONFLICT`/`ERR-PS02-STALE`** and sets `RETURNED`, no partial writes.
3. On success (or on the staged effective-date apply), `committed_at` set, items `COMMITTED`, request `COMMITTED`; **P05** captures old→new, authority chain, effective date.
4. STATUTORY items trigger the **PS01-posted** SR event (PS02 tracks status, FR-011) and retro-impacting items enqueue retro events **after** `COMMITTED`; `sr_posting_status`/`retro_status` track separately.
5. PS01/M01 unavailability → request `COMMIT_FAILED` with retry (X.1); no data loss.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: `effective_from` and `change_type` are passed to the PS01/M01 effective-dated path (staged by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`).
- BR2: Commit provenance is captured by **P05** (DB trigger; OPEN-PLAT-03 chain).
- BR3: No commit without a complete P01 approval set and (for sensitive) valid strong e-signature.
- BR4: For HR-initiated FINANCIAL changes, hold the first payroll credit until the objection window passes; emit retro event only after the hold clears.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_request_items` | UPDATE | item_status, commit key, sr_posting_status, retro_status |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | status, committed_at |
| `employees` (PS01/M01) | UPDATE (effective-dated, staged) ◆ | field value, version, effective_from |
| (P05) | capture | full provenance (DB trigger) |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| (internal) | `CommitService.apply(request)` | Triggered on APPROVED |
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/commit-status` | Commit/SR/retro status |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Requester sees "Approved & applied (effective {date})"; HR-initiated FINANCIAL shows "Applied — credit held until {objection window}"; failed commit shows "Applied with errors — HR notified"; HR sees a commit-failures queue with retry.

**Edge Cases:** Master changed concurrently (stale → return); PS01/M01 partial write (saga compensation); duplicate commit trigger (idempotent no-op); STATUTORY commit succeeds but PS12 posting fails (commit retained, SR retried — FR-011); retro ack fails (commit retained, retro retried — FR-022); effective-date in the future (staged by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`, applied on the date).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `CommitStatusPanel` (commit/SR/retro), HR `CommitFailureQueue`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `CommitService.apply()`: re-check hashes → open txn/saga (outbox) → apply per item to PS01/M01 effective-dated (`effective_from`, staged by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`) ◆ → mark COMMITTED → **PS01 posts the SR event** (`source_module=PS01`); PS02 tracks status (011) + enqueue retro (022) → P05 capture → set/clear FINANCIAL hold. |
| Data Operations | UPDATE items + request; PS01/M01 effective-dated commit; P05 capture; enqueue SR + retro (X.1). |
| Validation Logic | Stale hash (`VAL-PS02-STALEHASH`); approval-complete + strong e-sign; idempotency; objection-window hold. |
| Authorization Logic | System-triggered; manual retry: HR Admin (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | `APPROVED→COMMITTED` (or `COMMIT_FAILED`/`RETURNED`); SR + retro enqueue. |
| Failure Handling | Atomic rollback/saga compensation; retry w/ backoff (X.1); alert HR on persistent failure (JOB-FAIL). |

### FR-PS02-011 — Statutory Change Reflection in the Digital Service Register (PS01→PS12) & Posting-Status Reconciliation

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System (post-commit)
- **User Story:** *As the SR Custodian, I want approved statutory personal-detail changes reliably recorded in the Service Register by the master/identity owner (PS01), so that the statutory record stays authoritative and complete and there is a single SR source for identity events.*

**Description:** For committed items whose field has `post_to_sr=true`, the **PS01 employee-master owner posts** the identity/personal-data event to the **PS12** SR ledger (a **net-new enterprise append-only ledger on the P05 substrate**, `VAL-PS12-SREVENT`, **`source_module=PS01`**) as part of/after the effective-dated commit (FR-010). **PS02 is not a Digital-SR source:** its responsibility ends at committing the approved change to the PS01 master via the effective-dated staged write; at commit it supplies the SR context to PS01 — `sr_event_type`, `employee_id`, `effective_from`, before/after (masked/tokenised), `cr_number`, approval authority and e-signature reference — and then **tracks and reconciles the observed SR posting status** per item. PS02 never writes the PS12 ledger schema and never carries `source_module=PS02` SR payloads. Reversals (FR-020) commit a reversing change to PS01, on which **PS01 posts the reversing SR event**. Posting status observed per item; reconciliation gaps retried/escalated with a dead-letter queue and reconciliation report.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Only committed STATUTORY items (`post_to_sr=true`) cause a **PS01-posted** SR event (`source_module=PS01`); PS02 emits no SR write itself.
2. PS02's posting-status tracking is idempotent on `change_request_item_id + ':SR'`; duplicate reconciliations no-op.
3. An observed successful PS01 post sets `sr_posting_status=POSTED` with the returned reference; a missing/failed post sets `FAILED` and queues a reconciliation retry (X.1).
4. The SR context supplied to PS01 includes `effective_from`, before/after, `cr_number`, approver chain and e-signature reference.
5. Persistent reconciliation failure raises an alert to HR Admin + SR Custodian (X.2) and appears in the reconciliation report.
6. A reversal yields a reversing SR event **posted by PS01** (`source_ref = item_id + ':REV:' + reversal_id`); PS02 records the observed status.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: PS12 is the SR system of record and **PS01 is the posting `source_module`** for identity/personal-data events; PS02 only supplies context and tracks/reconciles.
- BR2: Per corrected sequence (R15), the PS01 SR posting follows `COMMITTED` and is tracked separately; it never gates `COMMITTED`.
- BR3: The SR event uses PS12-published event types only (`VAL-PS12-SREVENT`), posted under `source_module=PS01`; unknown types fail config validation (FR-012).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_request_items` | UPDATE | sr_posting_status (observed) |
| `service_register_events` (PS12) | **posted by PS01** (PS02 reads) | event_type, payload, source_ref |
| `cr_reversals` | READ/UPDATE | reversing_sr_status |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| (internal) | `SrReflectionTracker.reconcile(item)` | Tracks the **PS01-posted** SR event post-commit |

| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/sr-retry` | Manual reconcile/re-request PS01 post (HR Admin) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** SR status chip per statutory item (Posted / Pending / Failed); SR Custodian reconciliation dashboard (unposted/failed statutory changes with retry); reversing-event indicator.

**Edge Cases:** PS01 SR post not yet observed (reconcile + retry, PENDING); PS01 SR post rejected by PS12 (FAILED + alert, no silent loss); duplicate reconcile after retry (idempotent); event_type retired in PS12 (config alert); reversing event for a never-posted item (skip with note).

### FR-PS02-012 — Approval-Flow, Field-Sensitivity, E-Sign-Policy & Regex Configuration (W.1/W.2)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System Administrator (Org Admin)
- **User Story:** *As a system administrator, I want to configure which fields are sensitive, how each tier is approved, which e-sign methods are allowed, and safe validation rules, so that governance adapts without code changes.*

**Description:** Admin uses the **W.1 `cfg-approval-builder` / cfg-workflow-builder** and **W.2 `cfg-form-builder`** Org-Admin screens to manage the `field_sensitivity_catalog` (classify fields, evidence/portal/e-sign/SR rules, `is_auth_bearing`, `self_service_editable`, `hard_block_rule_ref`, `evidence_path`, **module-unique regex with ReDoS safety**, **per-field allowed e-sign methods**, cited `validation_ref`) and the versioned `approval_matrix_config`/`_rules` bound to a **P01 `workflow_code`**. Configs are **versioned and validated on save** (§3.2); activation retires the prior; **in-flight instances pin their version** (P01). Validation prevents invalid routes (no stages, unknown roles, duplicate levels, circular stage — `VAL-FLOW-NOCYCLE`, unknown PS12 event type, **auth-bearing auto-apply, unsafe regex, OTP/weak method on FINANCIAL/STATUTORY**).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Admin can create/edit/version a matrix scoped to entity or org unit, DRAFT→ACTIVE→RETIRED.
2. Activating sets `effective_from` and retires the previously active for that scope.
3. Saving is rejected (**422 `VALIDATION_FAILED`**) for zero stages (non-auto-apply), unknown roles, duplicate `level_no`, circular stage (`VAL-FLOW-NOCYCLE`), unknown PS12 event type, an `is_auth_bearing` field with `auto_apply_on_low=true` (`VAL-PS02-AUTHBEAR`), a FINANCIAL/STATUTORY field whose `allowed_esign_methods` is weak/missing-strong (`VAL-PS02-ESIGN-METHOD`), or an unsafe `validation_regex` (`VAL-PS02-REGEXSAFE`).
4. Catalog edits are versioned and apply to *new* requests only (in-flight pin their version, P01).
5. All config changes are captured by **P05 `security_audit_log`** (RBAC_CHANGE / config event) with before/after.
6. `validation_regex` is length/complexity-bounded, safe-regex compiled, execution-timeout (`VAL-PS02-REGEXSAFE`).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Config changes never retroactively alter in-flight requests' routes (P01 pinning).
- BR2: Only System Admin (Org Admin) may configure; cannot self-approve transactions (P02 SoD).
- BR3: An entity/global default matrix must always exist (cannot retire the last active default).
- BR4: E-sign method policy and auth-bearing/regex/hard-block rules validated at save.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `field_sensitivity_catalog` | CRUD (versioned) | sensitivity, rules, validation_ref, regex, methods, flags |
| `approval_matrix_config`/`_rules` | CRUD (versioned) | stages, roles, SLA, status scope, workflow_code |
| (P05 `security_audit_log`) | capture | config before/after |

**API References:**

|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PATCH | `/api/v1/admin/field-sensitivity` | Manage catalog (W.2) |
| GET/POST/PATCH | `/api/v1/admin/approval-matrices` | Manage matrices (W.1) |
| POST | `/api/v1/admin/approval-matrices/{id}/activate` | Activate version |
| POST | `/api/v1/admin/validation-regex/test` | Safe-regex test (`VAL-PS02-REGEXSAFE`) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** W.2 field catalog grid with inline sensitivity/rule editing (auth-bearing, e-sign-method, validation_ref, regex); W.1 approval builder with drag-order levels, parallel grouping, role pickers (RBAC), SLA inputs, status-scope; validation summary before activation; version history with diff.

**Edge Cases:** Retire last default matrix (blocked); overlapping effective dates same scope (blocked); role removed from RBAC still referenced (validation error); invalid/unsafe regex (rejected); auth-bearing auto-apply (rejected); weak e-sign on FINANCIAL/STATUTORY (rejected).

### FR-PS02-013 — Delegation of Approval Authority (P01 Delegate, Role-Independent)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Approvers (delegate own authority); System Admin (any)
- **User Story:** *As an approver going on leave, I want to delegate my approval authority for a period, so that requests keep moving while my decisions remain accountable — without elevating anyone's privilege.*

**Description:** Uses **P01 `delegate`** to delegate authority (optionally scoped by org unit and node types) to **another user who independently holds the required role** (verified by **P02**) for a validity window. The delegate appears as resolved assignee for matching P01 actions; decisions record both `assigned_to` and `delegated_from`. Delegations can be revoked; they auto-expire. SoD still applies (P02). Attempted delegation to an ineligible (role-lacking) user is blocked and logged to **P05 `security_audit_log`** + the privileged-action report (§12). *(Re-phased to P4 — §13.3.)*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. An approver can create a delegation to an eligible user with `valid_from/valid_to`, optional scope and node types.
2. While active, new and pending P01 actions within scope resolve to the delegate (P01 `delegate`); audit shows delegate + delegator.
3. Delegations can be revoked early (`REVOKED`) and auto-expire (`EXPIRED`).
4. A delegate subject to SoD on a request is excluded for that request (fall back to delegator/escalation).
5. Overlapping delegations resolve by most-specific scope then most-recent.
6. A delegate must independently satisfy the stage's `required_role` (`delegate_holds_role_verified=true`, **P02**); otherwise rejected at creation and any attempted action is **403 `FORBIDDEN`/`ERR-PS02-SOD`**, recorded in the security report.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Delegate must hold a role capable of the delegated node type — **delegation transfers the action, never the privilege** (P02 no-elevation).
- BR2: Delegation does not transfer configuration rights, only approval actions.
- BR3: Circular delegation is blocked.

**UI Behavior Notes:** "Delegate my approvals" form with eligible-user search (RBAC role-filtered), date range, scope/node-type selectors; banner when acting as a delegate; admin view of all active delegations; blocked-attempt indicator feeding the security report.

**Edge Cases:** Delegate also unavailable (P01 escalation); window overlaps a holiday (honored); delegate to ineligible role (blocked + logged); delegator returns early and revokes (pending P01 actions revert).

### FR-PS02-014 — Change-Request Templates (W.2 Forms)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System Admin / HR Admin (author); Requesters (use)
- **User Story:** *As an employee, I want guided templates for common changes (e.g., "Update bank account"), so that I provide the right fields and documents the first time.*

**Description:** Reusable templates (bound to **W.2 forms**, `w2_form_ref`) pre-select fields, prescribe required document types and show guidance. Requesters start "from template"; the editor pre-populates field rows and evidence requirements. Templates are scoped (entity/org unit) and can be activated/deactivated. Templates respect `self_service_editable` (Aadhaar/PAN/category never offered in a self-service template) and P02 field access. *(Re-phased to P4 — §13.3.)*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Admin/HR Admin can create templates specifying `field_keys`, `required_doc_types`, instructions, change_type, and `w2_form_ref`.
2. Requesters can start a request from an active template scoped to them; the editor pre-fills field rows (W.2 form).
3. Templates only include fields P02 authorises; unauthorized and HR-only fields are filtered at use time.
4. Deactivated templates are not selectable but historical requests retain their `template_id`.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: A template cannot bypass sensitivity/route/status/step-up rules; it only pre-fills the form.
- BR2: Required doc types in a template are guidance; the catalog's `requires_document`/portal remains authoritative for gating.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_request_templates` | CRUD | field_keys, doc types, instructions, w2_form_ref |
| `change_requests` | INSERT | template_id linkage |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/change-request-templates` | List available (cursor) |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests?fromTemplate={id}` | Start from template |
| POST/PATCH | `/api/v1/admin/change-request-templates` | Manage |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Template gallery on "New request" with descriptions and required-document hints; pre-filled W.2 editor with instructions panel.

**Edge Cases:** Template references a now-non-governed field (filtered with notice); requester unauthorized/HR-only fields (omitted, P02); template deactivated mid-draft (draft continues, new starts blocked).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `TemplateGallery`, pre-filled `ChangeRequestEditor` (W.2 form), `InstructionsPanel`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `TemplateService.instantiate()` filters fields by **P02** + self_service_editable, seeds items + doc hints from the W.2 form. |
| Data Operations | READ template; INSERT request with template_id; CRUD templates (admin). |
| Validation Logic | Active+scope; field-authorization + HR-only filter (P02); governed-field check. |
| Authorization Logic | Use: any requester (scoped); manage: HR Admin/System Admin. |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Creates DRAFT seeded from template. |
| Failure Handling | Invalid/inactive template → 404 `NOT_FOUND`/409 `CONFLICT`; partial field filtering with notice. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | Authoring (001), catalog (012), W.2. |
| Test Guidance | Pre-fill; unauthorized/HR-only field filtering; inactive block; historical retention. |

### FR-PS02-015 — Strong E-Signature on High-Sensitivity Approvals (Method Policy)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Approvers on HIGH-financial / STATUTORY P01 stages
- **User Story:** *As a senior approver sanctioning a statutory or financial change, I want to apply a legally sufficient, verifiable e-signature, so that my authorization is attributable and tamper-evident.*

**Description:** Captures a cryptographically attributable e-signature when an approver decides on a P01 stage configured `requires_esignature`. Method policy by tier (R1): **PASSWORD_REAUTH removed**; FINANCIAL (bank) and STATUTORY require **PKI/DSC or Aadhaar e-Sign**; OTP only for non-financial HIGH where policy allows (`VAL-PS02-ESIGN-METHOD`). The signed payload hash binds the exact P01 decision; the signature is stored append-only and **hash-chained (E10, aligned to OPEN-PLAT-03)** and referenced by the approval and any PS12 SR event. External provider integrated via **X.3**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A decision on a `requires_esignature` stage cannot be persisted (P01 `approve`) without a successful e-signature capture (412 `ERR-PS02-ESIGN`).
2. `signed_payload_hash` is the SHA-256 of the canonical decision payload; tampering invalidates verification; the e-sign ledger is hash-chained (OPEN-PLAT-03).
3. Signature metadata (method, signer, timestamp, IP, user-agent) recorded append-only (P05 also captures).
4. The e-signature reference is included in the PS12 SR event payload (FR-011) for STATUTORY changes.
5. Failed signature attempts are recorded and do not advance the stage.
6. The captured `sign_method` must be in `allowed_esign_methods`; FINANCIAL/STATUTORY reject `OTP`/weak (**422 `VALIDATION_FAILED`/`ERR-PS02-ESIGN-METHOD`**).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: The signer must be the acting approver (or P01 role-qualified delegate) — signature identity = decision identity.
- BR2: E-signatures are immutable; a re-decision requires a new signature.
- BR3: At least one strong method (PKI/DSC or Aadhaar e-Sign) is required for FINANCIAL and STATUTORY; `PASSWORD_REAUTH` does not exist.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `esignatures` | INSERT | method, payload hash, chain_hash, signer, metadata |
| `change_request_approvals` | UPDATE | esignature_id |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/approvals/{nodeId}/esign` | Capture signature (X.3 provider) |
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/esignatures` | List (auditor, cursor) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Signature modal triggered on Approve for sensitive P01 stages; method selector restricted to allowed strong methods; OTP/DSC/Aadhaar flows; signed payload summary; "You are legally signing this decision" notice.

**Edge Cases:** Provider down (decision blocked, X.3 retry; 412/`ERR-PRECOND`); payload changed after signing (hash mismatch → re-sign); delegate signs (identity recorded with delegator link); weak method on FINANCIAL/STATUTORY (rejected).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `EsignModal` with method-policy-restricted flows + payload preview. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `EsignService.capture()`: validate method ∈ policy (`VAL-PS02-ESIGN-METHOD`) → canonical payload → hash → invoke provider (X.3) → persist signature + chain_hash → link → allow P01 `approve`. |
| Data Operations | INSERT esignatures (hash-chained); UPDATE approval esignature_id; P05 capture. |
| Validation Logic | Stage requires e-sign; signer = approver/delegate; hash binding; method policy for FINANCIAL/STATUTORY. |
| Authorization Logic | Acting approver/role-qualified delegate on the stage only (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Enables P01 decision persistence; reference flows to PS12 SR event. |
| Failure Handling | Provider failure blocks decision (X.3); failed attempts logged; hash mismatch forces re-sign; weak method rejected. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | Approvals (004), PS12 (011), config method policy (012), X.3 + external providers. |
| Test Guidance | Block decision w/o e-sign; hash binding + chain; provider down; delegate signing; weak-method rejection. |

### FR-PS02-016 — Change Provenance, Field History, Tamper-Evident Audit (P05) & Reporting

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Auditor (Org-Admin read + entitlement), HR Admin, Employee (own history)
- **User Story:** *As an auditor, I want a complete, immutable, tamper-evident history of who changed what, when, on whose authority and against which document, so that I can verify compliance for any field at any time.*

**Description:** Surfaces full provenance of every governed-field change: chronological field history (per field, per employee) from committed requests, the complete P01 decision trail (recommenders, approvers, sanctioners, delegates, e-signatures), linked evidence, effective vs recorded dates, PS12 SR posting + **retro reconciliation status**, sourced from **P05** (`audit_log` via `Audit.query`) with **OPEN-PLAT-03 tamper-evidence**. Provides exportable audit reports and an employee-facing "my change history" view. All reads are P02-scoped and **themselves audited** (reading an audit log is an audited action, P05). Nothing is editable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. For any field on any employee (within P02 scope), the system shows an ordered history with old→new, dates (effective + recorded), authority chain, evidence, PS12 SR reference and retro status.
2. Employees can view their own change history; auditors/HR (in scope) can view others' (P02; PII masked per ceiling).
3. Reports are filterable (date range, field group, sensitivity, status, org unit, risk band) and exportable (CSV/PDF) with **cursor pagination**.
4. Sensitive values are masked per role even in reports (**P02 serialization mask**).
5. History is read-only; any access to sensitive provenance is itself captured by **P05**.
6. An **audit-integrity verifier** consumes the **P05 / OPEN-PLAT-03** hash-chain and reports any break (`JOB-PS02-AUDITVERIFY`).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: History derives from immutable sources (`change_request_*`, **P05 `audit_log`**, `esignatures`); never independently editable.
- BR2: Exports honor row-level scope and masking (P02).
- BR3: Reconciliation reports list any committed STATUTORY item not yet `POSTED` to PS12 and any retro event not yet `ACKED`.
- BR4: Tamper-evidence is P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03; integrity verification runs on a schedule and on-demand, alarming on any break.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `change_requests`/`_items`/`_approvals` | READ | full trail |
| `esignatures`, `cr_sla_events`, `retro_impact_events` | READ | signatures, SLA, retro |
| `audit_log` (P05, via `Audit.query`) | READ | source + access audit |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/employees/{id}/field-history` | Per-field history |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/change-requests` | Filterable report (cursor) |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/sr-reconciliation` | Unposted statutory items |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/retro-reconciliation` | Unacked retro events |
| POST | `/api/v1/audit/verify-chain` | Run P05/OPEN-PLAT-03 integrity verification |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Timeline view per field; report builder with filters and export; "my changes" tab for employees; masked values with P02 role-gated reveal (P05-audited); audit-integrity status tile (last verified, any breaks).

**Edge Cases:** Field changed many times (paginated timeline); large export (async via X.1 + download link); out-of-scope access (403 `FORBIDDEN`, P05-audited); chain break detected (alarm + auditor notification).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `FieldHistoryTimeline`, `ReportBuilder`, `SrReconciliationReport`, `RetroReconciliationReport`, `AuditIntegrityTile`, employee `MyChangesTab`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `HistoryService.fieldHistory()` + `ReportService.query()` (P02 scope + mask); `ChainVerifier.verify()` consumes **P05/OPEN-PLAT-03**; async export worker (X.1). |
| Data Operations | READ change_request_* + **P05 `Audit.query`** + esignatures + retro; P05 access capture; export to PS13. |
| Validation Logic | Filter validation; cursor pagination max 100; P02 scope; chain verification. |
| Authorization Logic | Own: employee; others: HR/Auditor in scope; mask per PII ceiling; chain-verify: Auditor/HR Admin/System Admin (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Read-only + P05 access capture; export artefact stored in PS13; chain-break alarm. |
| Failure Handling | Large export async with retry; access denial audited; chain break escalated. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | Diff (005), all lifecycle data, retro (022), PS13 exports, **P05**. |
| Test Guidance | Field timeline order; scope/masking; async export; SR + retro reconciliation accuracy; chain-break detection; access audit. |

### FR-PS02-017 — Data-Subject Notification & Confirmation/Objection Window ★ (Imp 2 / R2)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System (X.2/W.3); Employee (data subject)
- **User Story:** *As an employee, when someone else changes my record, I want to be told out-of-band and given a window to confirm or object before any money moves, so that I am protected from silent fraud.*

**Description:** On any change initiated by someone other than the data subject (`HR_ON_BEHALF`, `BULK`), PS02 sends an **out-of-band notice via X.2/W.3** (a channel distinct from the requester's session — SMS/email/postal/in-app to the *employee's* recorded contact; EMAIL mandatory/non-suppressible) and, for FINANCIAL changes, opens a configurable **confirmation/objection window** (`JOB-PS02-NOTICE`, X.1) during which the first downstream credit is held (FR-010 BR4). The employee can confirm, object (FR-021), or let the window elapse. Auth-bearing contact changes also notify the **old** contact value (anti-takeover, R1).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every `HR_ON_BEHALF`/`BULK` change creates a `data_subject_notices` row and dispatches an out-of-band notice (X.2, `MSG-PS02-DSNOTICE`).
2. For FINANCIAL changes, `objection_window_ends_at` is set; the request enters `NOTICE_HOLD`; the first credit is held until the window elapses or the subject confirms.
3. The employee can confirm (`CONFIRMED`), object (`OBJECTED`→FR-021), or the window elapses (`WINDOW_ELAPSED`, `JOB-PS02-NOTICE`).
4. Auth-bearing contact-field changes notify the OLD value (and the new) so a takeover is visible (`MSG-PS02-OLDALERT`).
5. Notice delivery status is tracked (X.2 backoff ×5 + DLQ); delivery failure raises an HR alert and blocks auto-clearance of the hold.
6. Notices never contain raw sensitive values (masked per P02).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Notice channel must differ from the requester's interaction channel (true out-of-band).
- BR2: The objection window is configurable per sensitivity (default: FINANCIAL 48h; others notice-only) via W.3.
- BR3: A delivered objection pauses the request (`OBJECTED`) and routes to the Grievance Officer (FR-021).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `data_subject_notices` | INSERT/UPDATE | channel, sent_at, objection_window_ends_at, outcome |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | status `NOTICE_HOLD`/`OBJECTED` |
| `notifications` (X.2) | INSERT | out-of-band dispatch |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/notice` | Notice + window status |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/notice/confirm` | Data subject confirms |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/notice/object` | Data subject objects (→FR-021) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Employee "Action needed: a change was made to your record" Tasks card with confirm/object actions and a countdown; HR sees "Held — awaiting data-subject window"; old-channel anti-takeover alert.

**Edge Cases:** Employee has no deliverable contact (escalate to HR; postal fallback; hold extended); employee confirms early (hold released early); objection after window elapsed but before credit posted (still pauses/triggers reversal review); bulk job → one notice per affected employee (X.2 fan-out).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `DataSubjectNoticeCard`, `ObjectionWindowCountdown`, HR `HeldRequests` view. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `NoticeService.dispatch()` on HR/BULK submit (X.2/W.3) → set window/hold → `confirm()/object()/elapse()` (`JOB-PS02-NOTICE`); clears FR-010 credit hold. |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE data_subject_notices; UPDATE change_requests.status; X.2 dispatch; P05 capture. |
| Validation Logic | Out-of-band channel selection (W.3); window computation; delivery confirmation. |
| Authorization Logic | Confirm/object: the data subject only (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | `→NOTICE_HOLD→(CONFIRMED|OBJECTED|WINDOW_ELAPSED)`; credit-hold release. |
| Failure Handling | Delivery failure → HR alert, hold not auto-cleared; X.2 retries + DLQ. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | **X.2/W.3**; commit/hold (010); objection (021); contact-change (002); `JOB-PS02-NOTICE`. |
| Test Guidance | Out-of-band dispatch; FINANCIAL hold+window; old-channel alert; confirm/object/elapse; undeliverable fallback; bulk fan-out. |

### FR-PS02-018 — Employment-Status Gating & Elevated Special Paths ★ (Imp 3 / R3)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System; HR Admin; Appointing Authority (elevated)
- **User Story:** *As HR governance, I want changes on non-active employees (retired, deceased, suspended, terminated) blocked from ordinary self-service and routed to elevated, status-specific controls, so that family-pension and terminal-benefit fraud is prevented.*

**Description:** Reads the target's PS01/M01 `employment_status` at submit (`employment_status_at_submit`) and applies a gate: `ACTIVE` follows the standard P01 route; **non-ACTIVE blocks self-service entirely** (P02) and routes HR-initiated changes to a status-specific elevated route (`employment_status_scope` matrix rule, FR-002). Bank/nominee changes on a `DECEASED` record route to a **family-pension controlled path** (Appointing Authority + enhanced evidence). `SUSPENDED`/`TERMINATED` require elevated authority + documented justification.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Self-service on any non-`ACTIVE` target → **403 `FORBIDDEN`/`ERR-PS02-STATUSGATE`**.
2. HR-on-behalf on non-`ACTIVE` is permitted only via the elevated route (`employment_status_scope`, FR-002).
3. Bank/nominee change on `DECEASED` routes to the family-pension controlled path with Appointing-Authority sanction and enhanced evidence; ordinary HR cannot self-approve (P02 SoD).
4. The status snapshot is recorded; if status changes between draft and submit, the gate is re-evaluated.
5. All status-gated decisions captured by **P05**.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Status gating precedes routing and step-up.
- BR2: `DECEASED` financial changes always require dual control and family-pension evidence; never auto-apply.
- BR3: Elevated paths cannot be bypassed by templates, bulk or delegation.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `employees` (PS01/M01) | READ | employment_status |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | employment_status_at_submit, status |
| `approval_matrix_rules` | READ | employment_status_scope routes |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/employees/{id}/status-gate?fieldKey=` | Gate decision + required path |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Self-service editor shows "This record is {status}; changes require HR with elevated approval"; HR editor shows an elevated-path badge and enhanced-evidence requirements for deceased/retired.

**Edge Cases:** Status changes mid-flow (re-gate; may block/elevate); `ON_LEAVE` treated as ACTIVE for routine fields (config can elevate); reactivation after retirement (rare — HR override with audit).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `StatusGateBanner`, elevated-path badge. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `StatusGateService.evaluate(target, field)` → ALLOW/BLOCK/ELEVATE → feeds routing (002). |
| Data Operations | READ PS01/M01 status; snapshot on CR; P05 capture. |
| Validation Logic | Status→path mapping; self-service block (P02); deceased financial dual-control. |
| Authorization Logic | Elevated path requires Appointing Authority per matrix (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Determines route; blocks self-service; enforces enhanced evidence. |
| Failure Handling | PS01/M01 status read failure → 412 `PRECONDITION_FAILED` (fail-closed: block). |
| Dependencies & Reuse | PS01/M01 read; routing (002); evidence (003); commit (010). |
| Test Guidance | Self-service block on non-ACTIVE; deceased bank dual-control; re-gate on mid-flow status change; fail-closed on status read error. |

### FR-PS02-019 — Fraud, Velocity & Anomaly Signal Detection ★ (Imp 7 / R10)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System; Fraud Reviewer (RBAC capability flag)
- **User Story:** *As HR governance, I want sensitive changes risk-scored for fraud patterns — mule accounts, pre-payroll/pre-exit spikes, device/velocity anomalies — and high-risk ones held for review, so that collusion and theft are caught before commit.*

**Description:** A risk engine evaluates each submitted request and emits `cr_risk_signals`, aggregating `risk_score`/`risk_band`. Signals: same new bank account across multiple employees (mule), changes within N days of payroll cutoff, within N days of separation, device/velocity anomalies, multi-employee from one device, auth-channel-change-then-financial (R1), off-hours bursts. `HIGH` injects a mandatory fraud-review stage into the P01 route via a **`CONDITIONAL`** branch (FR-002 AC7); `BLOCKED` holds commit pending review (412 `ERR-PS02-RISKBLOCK`). The Fraud Reviewer capability flag (RBAC §4.3) gates the review queue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Every HIGH/STATUTORY (and FINANCIAL) request is risk-evaluated at submit and on material edit (`JOB-PS02-RISK` for batch/velocity windows).
2. Each fired signal creates a `cr_risk_signals` row with type, severity, score and evidence.
3. `risk_band=HIGH` forces a P01 fraud-review stage before substantive approval; `BLOCKED` prevents commit (`ERR-PS02-RISKBLOCK`).
4. The same new bank account on ≥2 employees within a window fires `DUPLICATE_BANK_ACCOUNT` (mule) and surfaces the linked employees.
5. An auth-bearing contact change followed by a FINANCIAL change for the same employee within a window fires `AUTH_CHANNEL_THEN_FINANCIAL`.
6. A Fraud Reviewer can clear/confirm/escalate; outcomes captured by **P05**; a fraud report (PS14) and queue are provided.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Risk thresholds/windows are configurable (System Admin).
- BR2: A `CONFIRMED_FRAUD` outcome rejects the request (P01 `reject`) and raises a security alert (X.2).
- BR3: Risk evaluation never silently auto-approves; it can only add scrutiny.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `cr_risk_signals` | INSERT/UPDATE | signal_type, severity, score, review_outcome |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | risk_score, risk_band |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/fraud/queue` | Fraud-review queue (cursor) |
| GET | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/risk` | Risk signals + score |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/risk/{signalId}/review` | Clear/confirm/escalate |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/fraud` | Fraud analytics report |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Risk badge on approver/HR queues; fraud-signal panel listing signals with evidence (linked employee_ids for shared bank account); fraud-review queue with clear/confirm/escalate; fraud report tile (PS14).

**Edge Cases:** Legitimate shared account (reviewer clears with reason); high false-positive field (thresholds tunable); signal fires after approval but before commit (commit held, review forced); device signal unavailable (degrade gracefully).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `RiskBadge`, `FraudSignalPanel`, `FraudReviewQueue`, `FraudReport`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `RiskEngine.evaluate(request)` runs detectors → persist signals → aggregate band → influence routing (002, `CONDITIONAL` P01 branch) + commit gate (010); `JOB-PS02-RISK` for windows. |
| Data Operations | INSERT cr_risk_signals; UPDATE risk_score/band; P05 capture on review. |
| Validation Logic | Window/threshold config; duplicate-bank detection across employees (tenant-scoped); velocity windows. |
| Authorization Logic | Review: Fraud Reviewer capability flag within scope (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Injects fraud-review P01 stage; BLOCKED holds commit; CONFIRMED_FRAUD → REJECTED. |
| Failure Handling | Detector failure logged; fail-safe = add scrutiny (never auto-clear). |
| Dependencies & Reuse | Routing (002), approval (004), commit (010), X.2, PS14, X.1. |
| Test Guidance | Mule duplicate-bank; pre-payroll/pre-exit windows; device velocity; auth-then-financial chain; reviewer clear/confirm/escalate; BLOCKED commit hold. |

### FR-PS02-020 — Emergency Reversal / Break-Glass ★ (Imp 15 / R13)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** HR Officer (raise); HR Admin (auth 1) + Appointing Authority (auth 2)
- **User Story:** *As HR, when a wrong bank account is caught hours before payroll, I want a fast, dual-authorised reversal that restores the prior value and triggers a reversing statutory event (posted by PS01), so that the error is corrected before money moves — with full audit.*

**Description:** A fast, elevated-authority path to **reverse a committed erroneous change**. A reversal creates a `cr_reversals` row referencing the original committed item, requires **two distinct authorisers** (`auth1 ≠ auth2 ≠ original maker`, enforced by **P02 SoD** + `VAL-PS02-DUALAUTH`), restores `revert_to_value` to PS01/M01 via the effective-dated path, marks the item `REVERSED`, and — for statutory items — commits the reversing change to PS01, on which **PS01 posts the reversing PS12 SR event** (`source_module=PS01`; tracked via FR-011) and a reversing retro event (FR-022) is emitted. Idempotent on `item_id + ':REV:' + reversal_id`. Run as a short P01 dual-authorisation flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A reversal can be initiated only against a `COMMITTED` item, with a mandatory reason (`ERR-REASON-REQ`).
2. Execution requires two distinct authorisers; `auth1 ≠ auth2 ≠ original committing maker` (**P02 SoD**; 412 `ERR-PS02-DUALAUTH` if not satisfied).
3. On execution, PS01/M01 is restored to `revert_to_value` (effective-dated), item → `REVERSED`, request → `REVERSED`, all captured by **P05**.
4. Statutory reversals cause **PS01 to post** a reversing PS12 SR event (`source_module=PS01`; tracked via FR-011); retro-impacting reversals emit a reversing retro event (FR-022).
5. The reversal is idempotent; a re-run is a no-op.
6. If payroll has already consumed the change, the reversal still records and notifies PS10 to recover/adjust (tracked via retro).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Break-glass is logged to **P05 `security_audit_log`** + the privileged-action report (§12).
- BR2: A reversal never deletes history; it appends a compensating change.
- BR3: Dual authorisation is mandatory and cannot be a single person (P02).

**UI Behavior Notes:** "Emergency reversal" action on a committed item (elevated roles only), with a prominent dual-authorisation flow, mandatory reason, and a "break-glass action" warning; status panel showing PS01/M01 revert + reversing PS12 SR/retro status.

**Edge Cases:** Both authorisers same person (blocked, P02); original maker tries to authorise (blocked); reversal of an already-reversed item (idempotent no-op); payroll already paid (record + PS10 recovery via retro); reversing SR for a never-posted item (skip with note).

### FR-PS02-021 — Data-Subject Grievance & Objection ★ (Imp 16 / R14)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (data subject); Grievance Officer (RBAC capability flag)
- **User Story:** *As an employee, I want to contest or object to a change made to my record, so that an unauthorised or incorrect change is paused or reversed and reviewed fairly (DPDPA-aligned).*

**Description:** A DPDPA-aligned dispute path. The data subject can raise a `cr_objections` row against an **in-flight** request (effect `PAUSE` → `OBJECTED`) or a **committed** change (effect `REVERSAL_REQUESTED` → routes to FR-020 review). The objection is assigned to a Grievance Officer (capability flag) who reviews and resolves (`UPHELD`→pause/reverse, or `DISMISSED` with reason). Tied to the notice flow (FR-017) so an objection during the window pauses commit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A data subject can object to any change to *their own* record, in-flight or committed (P02 own-record).
2. An in-flight objection pauses the request (`OBJECTED`) and stops P01 SLA timers.
3. A committed-change objection creates a reversal-review item routed to FR-020 (dual-auth) if upheld.
4. Objections are assigned to a Grievance Officer; resolution requires a comment (`ERR-REASON-REQ`) and is captured by P05.
5. The data subject is notified of the outcome (X.2).

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: An objection during the FR-017 window holds any financial credit until resolved.
- BR2: Only the data subject (or authorised representative) may raise an objection on their record.
- BR3: An upheld objection on a committed change does not auto-edit; it triggers the governed reversal (FR-020).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `cr_objections` | INSERT/UPDATE | objection_type, status, effect, grievance officer |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | status `OBJECTED` |
| `cr_reversals` | INSERT (if upheld, committed) | reversal review |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/objections` | Raise objection (in-flight or committed) |
| GET | `/api/v1/objections/queue` | Grievance Officer queue (cursor) |
| POST | `/api/v1/objections/{id}/resolve` | Uphold/dismiss with comment |

**UI Behavior Notes:** "Object to this change" action on the data subject's notice/history; Grievance Officer queue with case detail, evidence, and uphold/dismiss; outcome notification (X.2).

**Edge Cases:** Objection after commit and after payroll (routes to reversal + PS10 recovery); duplicate objections (merged); objection on a legitimately self-initiated change (dismissed with explanation); representative objection (authorisation verified).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `ObjectionForm`, `GrievanceQueue`, `ObjectionCaseDetail`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `ObjectionService.raise()` → PAUSE (in-flight) or REVERSAL_REQUESTED (committed) → assign Grievance Officer → `resolve()` → pause/reverse/dismiss. |
| Data Operations | INSERT/UPDATE cr_objections; UPDATE change_requests.status; INSERT cr_reversals if upheld; P05 capture; X.2 notify. |
| Validation Logic | Ownership/representative (P02); in-flight vs committed effect; resolution comment mandatory. |
| Authorization Logic | Raise: data subject; resolve: Grievance Officer capability flag (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | `→OBJECTED`; credit hold; reversal trigger; SLA pause. |
| Failure Handling | Illegal state (already terminal) → 409 `CONFLICT` with guidance. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | Notice (017), reversal (020), SLA (007), X.2. |
| Test Guidance | In-flight pause; committed→reversal; window-credit hold; dismiss with reason; representative auth; outcome notice. |

### FR-PS02-022 — Downstream Retro-Impact Reconciliation (PS10/PS11/PS06) ★ (Imp 9 / R7)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** System; HR Admin (reconciliation)
- **User Story:** *As HR governance, I want every retro-impacting correction to actually trigger and confirm pay/pension/seniority recomputation downstream — tracked, retried and reconciled — so that the disputes PS02 exists to prevent are actually closed.*

**Description:** Replaces v1's fire-and-forget event with a **tracked, acknowledged, reconciled** loop. On commit of a retro-impacting item (catalog `retro_targets`), PS02 emits one `retro_impact_events` row per target module (**PS10** payroll, **PS11** pension, **PS06** seniority), each idempotent, dispatched via **X.3**, retried by the **X.1 runner** (backoff ×3) with dead-letter on persistent failure, and **reconciled** until the downstream module returns an acknowledgement (`ACKED`). Reversals emit reversing retro events.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On commit of an item whose catalog has `retro_targets`, one `retro_impact_events` row per target is created (`PENDING`) **after** `COMMITTED` (R15).
2. Each event is dispatched idempotently (`item_id + ':RETRO:' + module`) and transitions `SENT`→`ACKED` on downstream acknowledgement.
3. Persistent failure → `DEAD_LETTER` + HR alert (X.2, JOB-FAIL) + appears in the retro-reconciliation report (FR-016).
4. A retro event is not closed until `ACKED`; the reconciliation report lists any non-ACKED event.
5. Reversals (FR-020) emit reversing retro events.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Retro tracking never blocks the `COMMITTED` state (R15); reported/reconciled separately.
- BR2: Idempotency guarantees no double recomputation.
- BR3: `effective_from` drives the recomputation period passed downstream.

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `retro_impact_events` | INSERT/UPDATE | target_module, status, ack_reference, attempts |
| `change_request_items` | UPDATE | retro_status |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| (internal) | `RetroService.emit(item)` (X.3) | Triggered post-commit |
| POST | `/api/v1/retro-events/{id}/ack` | Downstream module acknowledges (PS10/PS11/PS06) |
| POST | `/api/v1/retro-events/{id}/retry` | Manual retry (HR Admin) |
| GET | `/api/v1/reports/retro-reconciliation` | Unacked/dead-letter events (cursor) |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Retro status chip per item (Pending / Sent / Acked / Failed); HR retro-reconciliation dashboard with retry and dead-letter triage; downstream ack reference shown.

**Edge Cases:** Downstream module down (X.3 queue + retry, PENDING); duplicate emit (idempotent); ack for an unknown event (rejected, logged); reversing retro after the original was already ACKED (compensating event).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `RetroStatusChip`, `RetroReconciliationDashboard`. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `RetroService.emit()`: build payload per target → dispatch idempotently (X.3) → await `ack()` → `ACKED`; X.1 retry/backoff/dead-letter; `emitReversing()` for FR-020. |
| Data Operations | INSERT retro_impact_events; UPDATE retro_status; P05 capture. |
| Validation Logic | retro_targets present; idempotency; ack matching. |
| Authorization Logic | System-triggered; ack: downstream module service identity (P02); retry: HR Admin. |
| State Changes & Side Effects | `PENDING→SENT→ACKED` or `FAILED→DEAD_LETTER`; reversing events. |
| Failure Handling | X.1 retry w/ backoff + dead-letter; reconciliation report; never drops. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | Commit (010), reversal (020), PS10/PS11/PS06 consumers, PS14, X.1/X.3. |
| Test Guidance | Per-target emit after commit; idempotent dispatch; ack→ACKED; dead-letter; reconciliation listing; reversing retro. |

### FR-PS02-023 — Requester Step-Up Authentication for Sensitive Self-Service ★ (Imp 6 / R16)

- **Module:** PS02-EPDM
- **Primary Role(s):** Employee (Self-Service)
- **User Story:** *As the platform, I want a fresh step-up re-authentication before an employee initiates a HIGH/STATUTORY self-service change, so that a hijacked session cannot silently start a sensitive change.*

**Description:** Before a self-service requester can submit a HIGH/STATUTORY change, PS02 **invokes the platform step-up challenge** (MFA TOTP/push, WebAuthn, or OTP — platform §3.1) and records a `cr_step_up_events` row with method, assurance level and a short validity window. Submission of a sensitive self-service request requires a valid, unexpired `SUCCESS` step-up bound to the request. Independent of approver e-sign (a different control at a different stage). High-privilege statutory roles already require MFA by default (§3.1).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Initiating a HIGH/STATUTORY self-service request triggers a platform step-up challenge.
2. A successful step-up creates a `cr_step_up_events.SUCCESS` row with `auth_assurance_level` (e.g. AAL2) and `expires_at`.
3. Submission without a valid, unexpired, request-bound step-up → **412 `PRECONDITION_FAILED`/`ERR-PS02-STEPUP`**.
4. Failed step-ups are recorded (P05 `security_audit_log`) and do not permit submission.
5. Step-up is required at initiation regardless of, and in addition to, any approver e-signature.

**Business Rules:**
- BR1: Step-up validity window is short and configurable (default 10 minutes).
- BR2: Step-up applies to self-service only; HR-on-behalf uses HR controls + data-subject notice instead.
- BR3: Step-up events are append-only and auditable (P05).

**Data Model References:**

| Entity | Operation | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `cr_step_up_events` | INSERT | method, result, assurance, expires_at |
| `change_requests` | UPDATE | step_up_event_id |

**API References:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/step-up/challenge` | Initiate platform challenge |
| POST | `/api/v1/change-requests/{id}/step-up/verify` | Verify challenge result |

**UI Behavior Notes:** Step-up modal (method per platform policy) shown when a sensitive field is added or at submit; "Confirm it's you to continue" prompt; expired step-up re-challenges automatically.

**Edge Cases:** Step-up provider down (block submission, retry; 412/`ERR-PRECOND`); step-up expires before submit (re-challenge); user abandons step-up (request stays DRAFT); HR-on-behalf path (no step-up; uses notice instead).

**LLD:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| Components & Screen Behavior | `StepUpModal`; auto re-challenge on expiry. |
| Backend-Service Flow | `StepUpService.challenge()/verify()` via **platform auth (§3.1)** → persist `cr_step_up_events` → bind to CR → gate submit (FR-001 AC7). |
| Data Operations | INSERT cr_step_up_events; UPDATE change_requests.step_up_event_id; P05 capture. |
| Validation Logic | Method per policy; assurance level; expiry; request binding. |
| Authorization Logic | Self requester only; sensitive tiers only (P02). |
| State Changes & Side Effects | Enables submit for sensitive self-service. |
| Failure Handling | Provider down → block + retry; failed/expired → re-challenge. |
| Dependencies & Reuse | Platform auth/step-up (§3.1); authoring (001). |
| Test Guidance | Challenge on sensitive; submit blocked without valid step-up; expiry re-challenge; provider down; HR-on-behalf skips step-up. |

## 7. UI Requirements

### 7.1 Key screens

| Screen | Primary role(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| My Requests (list) | Employee/HR | Track own/initiated requests with status, SLA, action-needed, risk flags |
| New Request / Template Gallery | Employee/HR | Start a request (blank or W.2 template); HR-only fields shown as HR-assisted |
| Change Request Editor | Employee/HR | `E·AR` "Request change" pattern; before/after diff rows, reason, effective date, clear-field, document attach, step-up |
| Review & Submit | Employee/HR | Final diff summary + computed P01 route + fraud/elevated badges |
| Approval Workspace | Approvers | P01 task queue + diff + evidence + risk panel + decision bar + strong e-sign (Me/My Team/Admin workspace) |
| Document & Authority-Portal Verify Panel | HR/authority | Verify/reject evidence (PS13) + portal verification (X.3) beside the diff |
| Data-Subject Notice & Objection | Employee | Confirm/object to a change to own record; objection window countdown |
| Grievance Queue | Grievance Officer (flag) | Triage and resolve objections |
| Fraud-Review Queue | Fraud Reviewer (flag) | Clear/confirm/escalate risk signals |
| Emergency Reversal (Break-Glass) | HR + dual authority | Initiate + dual-authorise a reversal |
| Bulk Correction Wizard | HR | Upload, validate, review, approve batch (P4) |
| Configuration Console | System Admin (Org Admin) | W.1/W.2 builders: field sensitivity, approval flow, e-sign policy, regex safety |
| Delegation Manager | Approvers/Admin | Create/revoke P01 delegations (P4) |
| Field History & Reports | Auditor/HR/Employee | Provenance timelines (P05), audit-integrity tile, exportable reports |
| SR & Retro Reconciliation Dashboard | SR Custodian/HR | Unposted/failed statutory + unacked retro events |

### 7.2 UX standards (platform canonical states — Foundation §3)

- **Five canonical states for every data surface:** **empty** (purpose + primary action), **loading** (skeleton, no layout shift), **error** (inline from an `ERR-*` id + retry, never a raw stack/500), **no-permission** (gating menu item hidden; deep-linked forbidden resource shows `ERR-FORBIDDEN`, not a 404 leak), **partial-data** (render what is authorised, mask the rest per RBAC). No skeleton-only screens.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA — keyboard navigable, focus-visible, ARIA labels, AA contrast, screen-reader-friendly diff ("old/new"/"cleared"); responsive 375/768/1280 px; touch targets ≥ 44×44 px.
- **Sensitive-value masking** by default with **P02 serialization mask**; audited reveal (vault detokenise) for permitted roles; Aadhaar last-4 only; masked-own-view (owner sees Tier-1 IDs masked, may export full record).
- **Inline validation** mapping to the platform error envelope `field` and `VAL-*` ids.
- **Status & risk semantics:** consistent color/iconography for statuses, SLA, risk band.
- **i18n & locale:** `DD-MMM-YYYY` dates, INR formatting, translatable labels; UTC stored; W.2 form i18n.
- **Confirmation & legal notices:** destructive/irreversible actions (reject, withdraw, activate matrix, break-glass reversal) require explicit confirmation; e-sign and break-glass show a legal/break-glass notice.
- **Out-of-band & step-up cues:** clear "confirm it's you" step-up and "a change was made to your record" data-subject prompts.
- **Workspace model:** approver tasks route to exactly one workspace (Me / My Team / Admin); switches audit-logged (Foundation §6.5).
- **Component vocabulary (Foundation §3):** `E·AR` request-change field, effective-dated field (current + staged value), masked field, multi-step wizard, list+filter+bulk toolbar, approval action bar (approve/reject/send-back/delegate), attachment control (`VAL-FILE`), comment box (`VAL-COMMENT`), date/effective-date picker, read-only audit trail panel.

### 7.3 Notable component behaviors

- Diff cards render typed values, highlights, and a cleared-field indicator; multi-line/JSON use structured diff.
- Approval queue shows SLA countdown, sensitivity, and risk badges; overdue + high-risk filters; P01 bulk queue actions on high-volume queues.
- Fraud-signal panel lists signals with evidence (linked employees for a shared bank account).
- Bulk validation grid filters valid/invalid with inline reasons, portal-required and non-ACTIVE flags, downloadable report.
- W.1 approval builder supports drag-ordered levels, parallel grouping, role pickers (RBAC), status-scope, e-sign-method policy, and a regex-safety tester with pre-activation validation.
- Audit-integrity tile shows last P05/OPEN-PLAT-03 chain-verification time and any detected break.

## 8. API & Integration

### 8.1 Conventions (platform — Foundation §1)

- Base path **`/api/v1`**; JSON; **JWT bearer** carrying resolved roles + tenant/entity scope; **P02 `Authorization.check`** enforced server-side (endpoints never re-implement permission logic); step-up tokens honored for sensitive initiation.
- All list endpoints use **cursor pagination** (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100, `next_cursor`); **offset paging is not used**.
- **`Idempotency-Key`** header on unsafe workflow-initiating POSTs (24h replay → original result); per-operation idempotency keys per §16.3.
- **`X-Correlation-Id`** request/response header, echoed to every P05 audit/log line; `?sort=field:asc|desc`.
- Timestamps ISO-8601 UTC; money INR; dates `YYYY-MM-DD` in payloads, `DD-MMM-YYYY` in UI; `effective_from` for effective-dated mutations.

### 8.2 Canonical error envelope

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Effective date must be on or before the original DOB date.",
    "field": "effective_from",
    "details": { "rule": "VAL-EFFECTIVE" }
  }
}
```

2xx returns the resource payload. **The correlation id is the `X-Correlation-Id` response header — there is no body `requestId`** (override of the invented v2 envelope, `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C).

### 8.3 HTTP / error-code catalog (platform 8-code table + PS02-unique `ERR-PS02-*`)

| Code | HTTP | When | Message id |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | **422** | A cited `VAL-*` fails (format/effective-date/required/null-without-clear); weak e-sign method | `ERR-PS02-*` / `ERR-PAST-DATED` / `ERR-REASON-REQ` |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | Missing/expired session | — |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Ownership/scope/permission/SoD/status-gate violation (P02) | `ERR-FORBIDDEN` / `ERR-PS02-SOD` / `ERR-PS02-STATUSGATE` |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Unknown/out-of-scope request/template/field/batch/objection/reversal | — |
| `CONFLICT` | **409** | Idempotency replay, **duplicate workflow start**, stale value, illegal transition, double-decision | `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE` / `ERR-PS02-STALE` |
| `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | **412** | Required precondition unmet: missing/unverified doc, portal verify, e-sign, step-up, DOB hard-block, risk-block | `ERR-PRECOND` / `ERR-PS02-AUTHPORTAL` / `ERR-PS02-ESIGN` / `ERR-PS02-STEPUP` / `ERR-PS02-HARDBLOCK` / `ERR-PS02-RISKBLOCK` / `ERR-PS02-DUALAUTH` |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Throttle exceeded | — |
| `INTERNAL` | 500 | Unexpected server error / invalid config fallback (no 503 — upstream handled via X.3 + `ERR-LOADFAIL`) | `ERR-LOADFAIL` |

**Notes (override of invented v2 codes, `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C):** `VALIDATION_ERROR(400)`→`VALIDATION_FAILED(422)`; `AUTH_REQUIRED(401)`→`UNAUTHENTICATED`; `INTERNAL_ERROR(500)`→`INTERNAL`; `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE(503)` **dropped** (X.3 maps upstream failure to 500/`ERR-LOADFAIL` or 412/`ERR-PRECOND`); invented `423 RISK_BLOCKED`/`502 SR_POSTING_FAILED`/`502 RETRO_ACK_FAILED` are **not HTTP codes** — they are *async statuses* surfaced via reconciliation reports and `JOB-FAIL`→`MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL`. New `ERR-PS02-*` ids are registered in the Foundation §5 catalogue.

**PS02-unique error ids registered (Foundation §5):** `ERR-PS02-STALE`, `ERR-PS02-STEPUP`, `ERR-PS02-STATUSGATE`, `ERR-PS02-HARDBLOCK`, `ERR-PS02-ESIGN`, `ERR-PS02-ESIGN-METHOD`, `ERR-PS02-AUTHPORTAL`, `ERR-PS02-RISKBLOCK`, `ERR-PS02-DUALAUTH`, `ERR-PS02-SOD`.

### 8.6 External integrations (all internal calls inherit auth context + idempotency key + correlation id + standard error envelope — Platform §0.4)

| System | Direction | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| PS01/M01 Employee Master | PS02↔PS01 | Read field/value/version + `employment_status`; **effective-dated** staged commit (`effective_from`, `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`, version token, idempotent) ◆ |
| **PS12** Digital SR (net-new enterprise ledger on P05) | **PS01→PS12** (PS02 reads status) | On commit, **PS01 posts** the identity/personal-data SR event (`source_module=PS01`, idempotent, `VAL-PS12-SREVENT`, incl. **reversing events**); PS02 supplies change context to PS01 and tracks posting status — **PS02 is not an SR writer** |
| PS13/M11 Document Mgmt | PS02↔PS13 | Upload ref, scan-status (`VAL-FILE`), reference, export-artefact store |
| Authority-verification providers (UIDAI/PAN/caste) | PS02→ via **X.3** | Verify + reference; credentials from `integration_credentials` (P04); circuit-break/retry |
| PS10 Payroll / PS11 Pension / PS06 Seniority | PS02↔ (event + ack) | Emits retro event (X.3); consumer **acknowledges** (`/retro-events/{id}/ack`); reversing events on FR-020 |
| PS06 Promotion | PS02→ | Promotion-eligibility freeze flag on caste/category verification |
| **P01** WorkflowEngine | PS02↔ | `startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel/query`; configured W.1 flow |
| **P02** Authorization | PS02→ | `Authorization.check` for every endpoint |
| **P05** Audit | PS02↔ | DB-trigger capture; `Audit.query/export`; OPEN-PLAT-03 |
| E-Sign provider(s) | PS02→ via X.3 | PKI/DSC, Aadhaar e-Sign, OTP (no password re-auth); method policy enforced |
| Platform step-up / MFA (§3.1) | PS02→ | Step-up challenge/verify for sensitive self-service initiation |
| Data vault / KMS | PS02↔ | Aadhaar tokenisation, field-level keys, rotation, crypto-shred |
| **X.2** Notification | PS02→ | IN_APP+EMAIL parallel; out-of-band data-subject notice; `MSG-PS02-*` |
| Business-calendar service | PS02→ | P01 SLA computation (calendar-day fallback for P1) |

## 10. Workflow & State Diagrams

### 10.1 Change request lifecycle (state table — driven by P01)

| From | Event | To | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | create draft | `DRAFT` | P02-authorized requester; status-gate ALLOW/ELEVATE |
| `DRAFT` | submit (sensitive self-service) | `SUBMITTED`/`PENDING_DOCS` | valid step-up (FR-023); **P01 `startInstance`** |
| `DRAFT` | submit (HR_ON_BEHALF/BULK) | `NOTICE_HOLD` | data-subject notice dispatched (FR-017, X.2) |
| `NOTICE_HOLD` | window elapsed / confirmed | `SUBMITTED`/`IN_REVIEW` | notice resolved, no objection |
| `NOTICE_HOLD` | data subject objects | `OBJECTED` | objection raised (FR-021) |
| `DRAFT` | submit (docs/portal needed) | `PENDING_DOCS` | required docs/portal not yet verified |
| `PENDING_DOCS` | all docs+portal verified | `IN_REVIEW` | VERIFIED+CLEAN (+portal VERIFIED) |
| `SUBMITTED` | first P01 stage opened | `IN_REVIEW` | route has stages |
| `SUBMITTED` | auto-apply (LOW, non-auth-bearing) | `APPROVED` | auto_apply_on_low, no docs, not auth-bearing |
| `IN_REVIEW` | P01 `approve` (more stages left) | `IN_REVIEW` | next stage pending |
| `IN_REVIEW` | all stages approved | `APPROVED` | route complete + strong e-sign where required + fraud cleared |
| `IN_REVIEW`/`PENDING_DOCS`/`NOTICE_HOLD` | P01 `sendBack` | `RETURNED` | approver/verifier, comment |
| `IN_REVIEW`/`PENDING_DOCS` | P01 `reject` | `REJECTED` | approver, comment |
| any non-terminal | fraud confirmed | `REJECTED` | CONFIRMED_FRAUD (FR-019) |
| `OBJECTED` | objection dismissed | `IN_REVIEW`/prior | Grievance Officer dismisses (FR-021) |
| `OBJECTED` | objection upheld (in-flight) | `REJECTED`/`RETURNED` | per resolution |
| `RETURNED` | resubmit | `SUBMITTED` | requester fixes, re-gate + re-route (P01 re-trigger) |
| non-terminal | withdraw | `WITHDRAWN` | requester owns (P01 `cancel`) |
| `APPROVED` | commit success (effective-dated) | `COMMITTED` | hashes valid, PS01/M01 applied/staged |
| `APPROVED` | commit fail (PS01 down) | `COMMIT_FAILED` | upstream error |
| `APPROVED` | stale at commit | `RETURNED` | hash mismatch (`ERR-PS02-STALE`) |
| `COMMIT_FAILED` | retry success | `COMMITTED` | PS01/M01 available |
| `COMMITTED` (multi-item, some failed) | partial | `PARTIALLY_COMMITTED` | some items FAILED |
| `COMMITTED` | break-glass reversal executed | `REVERSED` | dual-auth reversal (FR-020) |

### 10.2 Item-level states & corrected post-commit sequence (R15)

`PENDING → APPROVED → COMMITTED` (happy path); `PENDING → REJECTED`; commit failure → `FAILED`; `COMMITTED → REVERSED` (FR-020).
**Corrected canonical sequence:** **PS01/M01 effective-dated commit → item `COMMITTED` → (statutory) PS12 SR `PENDING`→`POSTED/FAILED` and (retro) retro `PENDING`→`ACKED/FAILED`.** SR posting and retro acknowledgement are tracked separately and **never** block `COMMITTED`.

### 10.3 P01 stage states

`PENDING → APPROVED | REJECTED | RETURNED | SKIPPED` (`PARALLEL_ANY_OF` loser / escalation). Each transition writes one **`workflow_actions`** row (idempotent advance). Terminal actions are immutable; P05 captures.

### 10.4 Distributed commit (saga/outbox) note

Because the PS01/M01 effective-dated write is **staged by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`** (§3.3), commit uses the **outbox pattern**: PS02 records intent in an outbox within its own transaction; a worker invokes the PS01/M01 effective-dated commit idempotently; on confirmation (or on the staged-apply date) marks items `COMMITTED`, after which **PS01 posts the SR event** (`source_module=PS01`; PS02 tracks status) and retro events are enqueued. Failure triggers compensation (no partial visible commit) and X.1 retry; persistent failure → `COMMIT_FAILED` with alert.

### 10.5 SLA state overlay (P01 SLA runtime)

Each active P01 stage carries an SLA timer: `SLA_SET → (REMINDER_SENT)* → BREACHED → ESCALATED → (REASSIGNED)`. Timers pause in `RETURNED`/`PENDING_DOCS(scan/portal pending)`/`NOTICE_HOLD`/`OBJECTED`. Reminders via `JOB-PS02-SLA` (X.1); breach/escalation via P01 SLA runtime + X.2.

### 10.6 Employment-status gate overlay (FR-018)

At submit, `employment_status_at_submit` drives: `ACTIVE`→standard; `ON_LEAVE`→standard (configurable elevate); `SUSPENDED`/`TERMINATED`→elevated authority + justification; `RETIRED`→elevated (terminal-benefit controls); `DECEASED`→family-pension controlled path (Appointing Authority + enhanced evidence, dual control on financial). Self-service blocked for all non-ACTIVE (`ERR-PS02-STATUSGATE`).

### 10.7 Reversal (break-glass) overlay (FR-020)

`COMMITTED item → reversal raised → auth1 → auth2 (distinct, ≠ maker, P02 SoD) → execute (PS01/M01 restore, effective-dated) → item REVERSED → reversing PS12 SR (statutory) + reversing retro (PS10/PS11/PS06)`. Idempotent; logged to P05 `security_audit_log`.

## 11. Notifications (X.2 / W.3 — IN_APP+EMAIL parallel; EMAIL mandatory for approvals & statutory)

All notifications are delivered by **X.2** (engine), configured via **W.3** (recipients/channels/timing), with copy in the Foundation Message Catalogue referenced by **`MSG-PS02-*`** id. Approval-workflow and statutory notices fire **IN_APP + EMAIL in parallel**; **EMAIL is mandatory and non-suppressible** (Platform §X.2; BRD §9.9). Retry backoff up to 5 + dead-letter; every dispatch audit-logged (P05).

| Event | Recipients | Channel | Template id |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request submitted | Requester (confirm), first approver | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-SUBMITTED` |
| Docs / authority-portal required or rejected | Requester | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-DOCS-NEEDED` |
| **Out-of-band data-subject notice (HR/BULK)** ★ | Data subject (out-of-band channel) | SMS/EMAIL/POSTAL/IN_APP | `MSG-PS02-DSNOTICE` |
| **Auth-bearing contact change — OLD value alert** ★ | OLD phone/email holder | SMS/EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-OLDALERT` |
| Awaiting your approval | Current P01 stage approver / delegate | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-TASK-ASSIGNED` |

| **FINANCIAL credit held (objection window)** ★ | Requester, HR | IN_APP | `MSG-PS02-CREDIT-HELD` |
| Returned for correction | Requester | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-RETURNED` |
| Rejected | Requester | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-REJECTED` |
| **Objection raised / resolved** ★ | Data subject, Grievance Officer | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-OBJECTION` |
| E-signature applied | Signer (receipt), Auditor (P05) | IN_APP | `MSG-PS02-ESIGN-RECEIPT` |
| Statutory change posted to PS12 | SR Custodian, HR Admin | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-SR-POSTED` |
| SR posting failed | SR Custodian, HR Admin | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-SR-FAILED` |
| **Retro event acked / failed / dead-letter** ★ | HR Admin | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-RETRO-STATUS` |
| **Emergency reversal executed** ★ | Data subject, HR Admin, SR Custodian, PS10 | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-REVERSAL` |
| Commit failed | HR Admin | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-COMMIT-FAILED` |
| **Audit-chain integrity break** ★ | Auditor, HR Admin, System Admin | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-AUDIT-BREAK` |
| Bulk batch validated/committed | Initiator, approver | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-BULK-STATUS` |
| Delegation created/expiring | Delegate, delegator | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-PS02-DELEGATION` |
| Scheduled job failed | Owning HR admin + platform ops | IN_APP + EMAIL | `MSG-SYS-JOBFAIL` (shared) |

Data-subject and old-channel alerts use an **out-of-band** channel distinct from the requester's session. All `MSG-PS02-*` ids are registered in the Foundation §5 master index.

## 12. Reporting & Analytics (feeds PS14 Dashboard & Analytics; P02-scoped, P05-sourced)

| Report | Audience | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Change request volume & cycle-time | HR Admin, PS14 | Counts by status, sensitivity, field group; median/percentile turnaround |
| SLA compliance & escalations | HR Admin | % within SLA, breaches, escalations, aging buckets (P01 SLA data) |
| Approver workload & delegation | HR Admin | Pending per approver/role; P01 delegation usage |
| Rejection/return analysis | HR Admin | Top rejection reasons, fields, resubmission rates |
| Statutory SR reconciliation | SR Custodian | Committed STATUTORY items vs the **PS01-posted** SR events in PS12; reconciliation gaps/failures |
| **Retro-impact reconciliation** ★ | HR Admin, PS10/PS11/PS06 | Retro events by status; unacked aging |
| **Fraud & anomaly report** ★ | Fraud Reviewer, HR Admin | Signals by type/severity; mule clusters; pre-payroll/pre-exit spikes; review outcomes |
| **Data-subject rights report** ★ | HR Admin, DPO/Grievance | Notices delivered, objections raised/upheld/dismissed, window-held credits |
| **Privileged-action & SoD security report** ★ | Auditor, System Admin, Security | Config changes (P05 `security_audit_log`), delegations (incl. blocked ineligible attempts), break-glass reversals, SoD-violation attempts |
| **Audit-integrity report** ★ | Auditor, System Admin | Last P05/OPEN-PLAT-03 verification, any chain breaks, e-sign chain status |
| Field-change provenance / audit | Auditor | Full who/what/when/authority/document per field (FR-016, P05) |
| Bulk correction outcomes | HR Admin | Batch success/partial/fail, per-row error patterns |
| Data-quality impact | HR Admin, PS14 | Corrections vs updates trend; high-correction fields |

Reports are filterable, **cursor-paginated**, P02-scoped, masked (PII ceiling), and exportable (CSV/PDF via PS13). Aggregates feed **PS14** as **change-request / workflow operational analytics only** (volume, cycle-time, SLA, fraud, data-subject, reconciliation health). **SR-event analytics are sourced by PS14 from PS12 (fed by PS01→PS12), not from PS02** — PS02 is not an SR feed into the analytics mart.

---

## 13. Migration & Launch (on P06 framework)

### 13.1 Data migration (P06 ETL+V)

- Seed `field_sensitivity_catalog` from the **PS01/M01 governed-field registry (§5.8)** with `m01_field_key` + `validation_ref` bound; classify per the re-grounded security-hardened seed (auth-bearing contacts MEDIUM; Aadhaar/PAN/category HR-only + portal; DOB hard-block; dignity-aware gender; `E·AR` mapping).
- Seed a default `approval_matrix_config` (ACTIVE) bound to a **W.1 `WF-PS02-SENSITIVE-CHANGE`** flow + rules incl. `employment_status_scope` elevated routes.
- Seed e-sign method policy (strong-only for FINANCIAL/STATUTORY) and `VAL-PS02-REGEXSAFE` regex limits.
- Import in-flight legacy change requests as historical/closed records (no re-approval), provenance preserved; migrate via **P06** (Extract→Validate→Transform→Load→Verify; 3 dry runs; `migration_runs` ledger; `<enterprise>_source_id` traceability column against the legacy register).
- Backfill `documents` references via PS13.

### 13.2 Cutover

1. Deploy schema (E1–E17, E19) + config seed; **verify the PS01/M01 effective-dated commit (`JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`), PS12 reversing-event, PS13 scan, authority-portal (X.3), step-up (§3.1) and retro-ack contracts in staging (§14.5)**.
2. Freeze direct master edits; route all governed-field changes through PS02 (the platform `E·AR` "Request change" pattern).
3. Pilot with one entity (self-service contact fields only — auth-bearing reclassification + old-channel alert), then expand sensitivity tiers.
4. Enable statutory, bulk, delegation, templates only after pilot sign-off and gate clearance.

### 13.3 Rollout phasing (re-phased — Improvement 22; security first)

| Phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| **P1** | LOW/MEDIUM contact & demographic fields (auth-bearing reclassification, old-channel alert), single-stage P01 approval, **employment-status gating (FR-018), data-subject notice (FR-017), P05 tamper-evident audit, step-up (FR-023)** |
| **P2** | HIGH fields (bank, qualification) + documents (PS13) + **strong e-sign policy (FR-015)** + **fraud signals (FR-019)** + **emergency reversal (FR-020)** + **data-subject grievance (FR-021)** + FINANCIAL objection-window hold |
| **P3** | STATUTORY fields + PS12 SR posting (FR-011) + **retro reconciliation (FR-022)** + senior sanction + DOB hard-block/caste/gender (FR-008) + authority-portal verification (FR-003, X.3) |
| **P4** | Convenience/scale: **templates (FR-014, W.2), delegation (FR-013, P01), bulk corrections incl. 50k async (FR-009, X.1), `PARALLEL_ANY_OF` topology** |

### 13.4 Launch readiness

Acceptance/E2E tests green; SoD + dual-auth + status-gate verified (P01/P02); **PS01/M01 effective-dated commit + PS12 + PS13 + authority-portal + step-up + retro-ack contracts VERIFIED in staging (§14.5)**; SR + retro reconciliation reports empty; **P05/OPEN-PLAT-03 integrity verifier green**; rollback plan (disable PS02 write path, revert to controlled HR edit with audit) documented; training for HR/approvers/grievance/fraud reviewers; runbooks for commit-failure, SR-posting-failure, retro-dead-letter, fraud-queue and break-glass.

### 14.2 Dependency on other modules / platform

| Module / service | Nature | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| PS01/M01 Employee Master | Read field values + status; **effective-dated** staged commit | PS02↔PS01 |
| PS12 Digital SR | **PS01 posts** statutory + reversing change events on commit; PS02 supplies context + tracks status | **PS01→PS12** (PS02 reads) |
| PS13/M11 Document Mgmt | Store/reference/scan evidence + exports | PS02↔PS13 |
| Authority portals (UIDAI/PAN/caste) | Verify identity/caste evidence (via X.3) | PS02→external |
| PS10/PS11/PS06 | Consume + **acknowledge** retro-impact events; PS06 promotion freeze | PS02↔PS10/PS11/PS06 |
| PS14 Dashboard | Consume analytics | PS02→PS14 |
| **P01** WorkflowEngine | Routing/stages/SLA/delegation | PS02↔P01 |

### 14.3 Parallel-agent build plan (re-ordered — security first; platform-grounded)

| Workstream | FRs | Can parallelize after |
|---|---|---|
| A — Data & config foundation | 012, schema (E1–E17, E19) + tenancy, seeds, **W.1 flow config** | first |
| B — Authoring, diff & step-up | 001, 005, 023 (P02, platform step-up) | A |
| C — Routing, approval & status gate | 002, 004, 018 (**P01** flow) | A |
| D — Evidence, authority-portal & e-sign | 003, 015 (PS13, X.3) | A |
| E — Data-subject rights & fraud | 017, 019, 021 (X.2/W.3) | B, C |

### 14.4 Dependency Register (honest — Improvement 11 / R8; platform-grounded)

States: **AGREED** · **IMPLEMENTED** (producer built) · **VERIFIED** (validated end-to-end in staging). **No BRD-specification gaps remain (§14.6); build-time contract verification is tracked as gates.** Platform engines (P01/P02/P05/X) are already-built platform contracts (IMPLEMENTED) consumed by id.

### 14.5 Build-Gate Register (hard preconditions — R4/R8/R11)

| Gate | Condition to clear | Blocks | Owner |

### 14.6 Final Reconciliation Table (specification completeness — 0 unresolved gaps; platform-alignment rows)

This table asserts **specification** completeness (every contract surface is defined and consumed); it does **not** assert that producers are built — tracked honestly in §14.4 (states) and §14.5 (gates). **Platform-alignment rows** confirm each invented v2 mechanism is re-grounded on a named platform engine.

| Contract surface | Producer | Consumer | Spec status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workflow / maker-checker → P01** | Platform | PS02 (002/004/006/007/013) | Specified (§4.2, FR-002/004) — **re-grounded from invented `workflow_*`** |
| **Authz / SoD / PII ceiling / field mask → P02** | Platform/RBAC | PS02 (all) | Specified (§3, §4.2) — **re-grounded from invented authz** |
| **Audit / tamper-evidence → P05 + OPEN-PLAT-03** | Platform | PS02 (016) | Specified (§5.1 E18-removed, §9) — gate G-AUDIT-OPENPLAT03 |
| **Notifications → X.2 / W.3** | Platform | PS02 (011/017/021) | Specified (§11) — **re-grounded** |
| **API conventions + error table → Foundation §1** | Platform | PS02 (§8) | Specified (§8) — **re-grounded (422/409/412; cursor; X-Correlation-Id)** |
| **RBAC roles + enterprise additions → RBAC v1.7** | RBAC | PS02 (§3) | Specified (§3.0) — **re-grounded from invented role list** |
| **Multi-tenancy (`tenant_id`/`entity_id`)** | Platform | PS02 (all entities) | Specified (§5.2) — **added** |
| PS01/M01 read + effective-dated staged commit | PS01/M01 | PS02 (001/010/018) | Specified (§8.6, §5.8) — gate G-PS01-COMMIT |
| PS12 statutory + reversing posting (`VAL-PS12-SREVENT`) | PS12 | PS02 (011/020) | Specified (§8.6) — gate G-PS12-SR |
| PS13 document/scan/export | PS13/M11 | PS02 (003/009/016) | Specified (§8.6) |
| Authority-portal verification (X.3) | External | PS02 (003/008) | Specified (§8.6) — gate G-AUTH-PORTAL |
| Retro-impact + ack (X.3/X.1) | PS10/PS11/PS06 | PS02 (022) | Specified (§8.6) — gate G-RETRO-ACK |
| Step-up (§3.1) + strong e-sign (X.3) | Platform/External | PS02 (015/023) | Specified (§8.6) — gate G-STEPUP/ESIGN |

| Emergency reversal (dual-auth, P02 SoD) | PS02 | HR/authority (020) | Specified (FR-020) |
| `VAL-*`/`MSG-PS02-*`/`ERR-PS02-*`/`JOB-PS02-*` ids | PS02 + Foundation | PS02 | Specified (§4.3, §8.3, §11, §16.6) — register in Foundation indexes |

**Unresolved specification gaps: 0.** **Open build-time hard gates: 7 (tracked in §14.5)** — honest preconditions, not specification gaps. **Platform-alignment: 7 re-grounding rows confirm every invented v2 mechanism now runs on a named PrimeSoft engine (P01/P02/P05/X/W) + RBAC v1.7 + multi-tenancy.**

## 15. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Maker-Checker | SoD control where the initiator (maker) cannot approve (checker) their own change — **enforced by P01/P02**, not re-coded |
| SoD | Segregation of Duties — maker ≠ checker; no self/target approval; dual-auth for reversal (P02 deny-by-default + multi-role intersection) |
| **P01 WorkflowEngine** | The platform engine running all approval/maker-checker flows (`startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel/query`; patterns SEQUENTIAL/PARALLEL_ALL_OF/PARALLEL_ANY_OF/CONDITIONAL/DYNAMIC_APPROVER; in-flight version pinning) |
| **P02 Authorization.check** | The platform authz enforcement (deny-by-default → role → intersection → entitlement → flag → PII ceiling → scope filter → field mask on serialization) |
| **P05** | The platform dual-log audit (`audit_log` + `security_audit_log`, DB-trigger, immutable, ≥7-yr); tamper-evidence tracks OPEN-PLAT-03 |
| **`E·AR` field** | An Approval-Required PII field (RBAC §7) that renders read-only with a platform **"Request change"** control routing to P01 — never a direct write (Foundation §3) |
| VERIFY node | A P01 stage that *checks evidence/documents* (does not by itself authorise) |
| APPROVE node | A P01 stage that *authorises* at an intermediate tier |
| SANCTION node | The senior P01 stage that *grants final authority* — "sanction" = **grant**, not penalty |
| RECOMMEND node | An advisory P01 stage (e.g., reporting manager) feeding a later APPROVE/SANCTION |
| Correction | Repair of an erroneous historical value, effective from the original date (tracked retro impact) |
| Update | Genuine forward-dated change to a field |
| Reversal / Break-glass | Fast, dual-authorised undo of a committed erroneous change, with reversing PS12 SR/retro events |
| Effective date (`effective_from`) | Date from which a change takes effect; staged by `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`, not written live (§3.3) |
| Sensitivity tier | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/STATUTORY classification driving route, evidence, e-sign |
| Approval matrix | Configurable rule set (bound to a W.1 P01 flow) mapping sensitivity/scope/field/status to ordered P01 stages |
| Topology / pattern | P01 execution pattern of stages at a level (SEQUENTIAL / PARALLEL_ALL_OF / PARALLEL_ANY_OF / CONDITIONAL / DYNAMIC_APPROVER) |
| Delegation | Temporary transfer of an approval **action** via **P01 `delegate`** to a user who **independently holds the role** (P02 verified; never elevation) |
| E-signature | Cryptographically attributable approval signature; strong = PKI/DSC or Aadhaar e-Sign (OTP weak; password re-auth removed) |
| Digital SR (PS12) | Statutory Digital Service Register — a net-new enterprise append-only ledger on the **P05** substrate |
| Provenance | Full who/what/when/authority/document trail of a change (sourced from P05) |
| Tamper-evident audit | P05 DB-trigger dual-log + OPEN-PLAT-03 hash-chaining (chain head → WORM); + hash-chained `esignatures` |
| Stale-value guard | Hash check ensuring the master value did not change between submit and commit |
| Saga / Outbox | Reliability pattern for atomic, eventually-consistent commit across services (needed because the PS01/M01 effective-dated write is staged) |
| Retro impact | A correction's downstream recomputation in payroll/pension/seniority — tracked, acknowledged and reconciled (X.1/X.3) |
| Data subject | The employee whose record is being changed; a first-class party with notice and objection rights |
| Gazette | An official enterprise notification; traditional documentary proof for statutory name/DOB changes |
| Cadre | A service classification/grade (owned by PS05/PS06); distinct from social/reservation `category`; NOT editable via PS02 |
| Social category | Statutory reservation category (GEN/OBC/SC/ST/EWS) = PS01/M01 `employees.category`; verified via authority portal |
| Dignity-aware gender path | Path distinguishing a gender-marker *data-error correction* from *gender-identity recognition* (NALSA / Transgender Persons Act 2019), privacy-protected, non-gazette |
| Mule account | A bank account reused across multiple employees, a fraud signal (`DUPLICATE_BANK_ACCOUNT`) |
| Capability flag | An RBAC §4.3 grantable extension to an existing role (e.g., Grievance Officer, Fraud Reviewer) — not a new role |
| `tenant_id` / `entity_id` | Multi-tenancy scope columns on every table; data-layer scoped; unscoped query rejected (Platform §0.1) |

## 16. Appendices

### 16.1 Appendix A — Default field sensitivity seed

See §5.5 (re-grounded security-hardened seed with `VAL-*` + `E·AR`) and §5.8 field-key registry. Configurable via FR-PS02-012 (W.1/W.2).

### 16.2 Appendix B — Sample P01 approval routes by sensitivity & status

| Sensitivity / status | Route (P01 stages) |
|---|---|
| LOW (non-auth-bearing) | [APPROVE: HRBP] (or auto-apply) — `SEQUENTIAL` |
| LOW/MEDIUM (auth-bearing contact) | [APPROVE: HRBP] + notify OLD value (no auto-apply) |
| MEDIUM | [VERIFY+APPROVE: HRBP] |
| HIGH (financial, `E·AR`) | [VERIFY: HRBP] → [APPROVE: HR Admin] (+ strong e-sign PKI/DSC or Aadhaar) (+ `CONDITIONAL` fraud-review stage if high risk) |
| STATUTORY | [VERIFY: HRBP] → [SANCTION: HOD/APPOINTING_AUTHORITY] (+ strong e-sign) → PS12 SR post → retro reconcile |
| STATUTORY identity (Aadhaar/PAN/category, `E·AR`) | HR-only initiation → authority-portal VERIFY (X.3) → SANCTION (+ strong e-sign) → PS12 SR post (+ PS06 freeze for category) |
| DECEASED (bank/nominee) | Family-pension controlled path: HR initiate → enhanced evidence → [SANCTION: APPOINTING_AUTHORITY] dual control |
| DOB within bar window | `ERR-PS02-HARDBLOCK` → separate legal-process path only |

### 16.3 Appendix C — Canonical idempotency keys (+ `Idempotency-Key` header)

- Commit: `commit_idempotency_key = change_request_item_id`.
- SR posting: `source_ref = change_request_item_id + ':SR'`.
- Retro event: `idempotency_key = change_request_item_id + ':RETRO:' + target_module`.
- Reversal: `idempotency_key = change_request_item_id + ':REV:' + reversal_id`.
- All workflow-initiating POSTs also carry the platform **`Idempotency-Key`** header (24h replay → original result; duplicate start → 409 `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`).

### 16.4 Appendix D — Assumptions register

| # | Assumption | Owner | Resolution / Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | PS01/M01 exposes field metadata + **effective-dated staged** commit (`effective_from`, `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`) | PS01 team | §8.6; **Gate G-PS01-COMMIT** (R4) |
| A2 | PS12 exposes idempotent SR append + reversing event; **PS01 posts** identity/personal-data SR events (`source_module=PS01`); PS02 tracks status | PS12 + PS01 teams | §8.6; Gate G-PS12-SR |
| A3 | PS13/M11 provides scan-status + references | PS13 team | §8.6; Gate (D) |
| A4 | Strong e-sign provider (PKI/DSC, Aadhaar) + platform step-up (§3.1) available | Platform | FR-015/023; Gate G-STEPUP/ESIGN |
| A5 | Business-calendar service available (else calendar-day fallback P1) | Platform | FR-007 |

| A8 | Platform data vault + KMS for Aadhaar tokenisation + crypto-shred | Platform | §4.4 |
| A9 | **OPEN-PLAT-03** hash-chaining is confirmed/built before statutory-grade tamper-evidence relied on | Platform Security/Arch | §9; Gate G-AUDIT-OPENPLAT03 |
| A10 | P01/P02/P05/X.1–X.3/W.1–W.3 are live platform contracts consumed by id | Platform | §4.2 (IMPLEMENTED) |

### 16.5 Appendix E — Open items

No **specification** gaps remain (§14.6). **7 build-time hard gates** (§14.5) are tracked — chiefly **G-PS01-COMMIT** (effective-dated staged write, R4), **G-FIELDKEY** (R9), and **G-AUDIT-OPENPLAT03** (the platform's own `OPEN-PLAT-03` hash-chaining, which enterprise statutory-grade tamper-evidence must track rather than invent). These must be VERIFIED in staging before Workstream G / integrity reliance.

## Alignment with PrimeSoft Platform

This section maps every FR to the platform service(s) it runs on (Authoring Rule 6, `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §9). PS02 authors **no** platform engine — it **extends the existing PrimeSoft M01 sensitive-field-change pattern** (the "Request change → approval" UI state on P01) and configures it for the public sector. The only **`GAP (enterprise-specific)`** surface PS02 *depends on* (does not own or write) is the **PS12** Digital Service Register — a net-new enterprise ledger on the P05 substrate to which **PS01 (not PS02) posts** identity/personal-data events on commit (`source_module=PS01`); PS02 supplies the change context and tracks the posting status.

| FR-PS02-022 Retro reconcile | **X.3** dispatch + **X.1** retry/DLQ; PS10/PS11/PS06 ack | Platform §X.1/§X.3 | Downstream loop = enterprise-specific |
| FR-PS02-023 Step-up | Platform **MFA / step-up** (§3.1) | Platform §3.1; §P02 | No |

**RBAC alignment:** all roles map to RBAC v1.7 (§3.0); **new enterprise roles** (`Appointing Authority`, `SR Custodian`) and **capability flags** (`Grievance Officer`, `Fraud Reviewer`) are ADDITIONS registered in RBAC §2.2/§4.3, with SoD enforced by P01/P02. **Net-new enterprise engine authored:** none in PS02 — it *commits to* PS01 (whose owner posts the identity/personal-data SR event to PS12, the only enterprise ledger; **PS02 is not an SR source**) and *invokes* external authority portals; all approval/audit/notification/jobs/forms/authz run on the existing platform engines.

## Amendments (v2 → v3: platform re-grounding)

Each row is a concrete change applied to re-anchor v2 onto PrimeSoft, with the cited override from `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §C / `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md`. **Requirements, FRs, entities and rigor are unchanged** — only the substrate.

| # | v2 (invented) | v3 (platform-grounded) | Cited override |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Module code `M02-EPDM`; downstream `M01/M06/M10/M11/M12/M13/M14` | **`PS02-EPDM`**; `PS01/PS06/PS10/PS11/PS12/PS13/PS14` | `MODULE_RECONCILIATION.md` §B (PS-code scheme) |
| 2 | Invented `workflow_instances` / `workflow_tasks` "shared engine" | **P01 WorkflowEngine** (`workflows`/`workflow_instances`/`workflow_actions`; `startInstance/advance/approve/reject/sendBack/delegate/cancel`; 5 Appendix-D patterns; in-flight version pinning; idempotent advance). Change-request entities are the **subject/context** of P01 instances, not a parallel engine | §C row "workflow_instances/workflow_tasks"; Platform §P01 |
| 3 | Bespoke maker-checker + SoD logic | **P01 flows + P02 SoD** (deny-by-default, multi-role intersection, no self-approval) — not re-coded | §C row "maker-checker"; Platform §P01/§P02; RBAC §5 |
| 4 | Invented authz / "view_sensitive_value" / masking | **P02 `Authorization.check`** + **PII Protection Ceiling** + **field mask on serialization**; `E·AR` fields use the platform **"Request change"** state | Platform §P02; RBAC §3.9/§6/§7; Foundation §3 |
| 5 | Invented `audit_log` + `cr_audit_chain` (E18, parallel hash-chain) | **P05 dual-log** (`audit_log` + `security_audit_log`, DB-trigger, immutable, ≥7-yr); tamper-evidence tracks **OPEN-PLAT-03**. **E18 removed** (18 entities) | §C rows "audit_log" / single audit; Platform §P05/§Z |
| 6 | `service_register_events` as a "shared platform entity" | **PS12** net-new enterprise SR **ledger on the P05 substrate**; **PS01 (master/identity owner) posts** identity/personal-data events on commit (`source_module=PS01`, `VAL-PS12-SREVENT`); PS02 supplies context + tracks status and does not own/write the schema *(corrected in v3.1 — see cross-module remediation table; PS02 is not an SR source)* | §C row "service_register_events"; §D |
| 7 | Error codes `VALIDATION_ERROR(400)`, `AUTH_REQUIRED(401)`, `INTERNAL_ERROR(500)`, `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE(503)`, `423/502` | **Platform 8-code table:** `VALIDATION_FAILED(422)`, `UNAUTHENTICATED(401)`, `FORBIDDEN(403)`, `NOT_FOUND(404)`, `CONFLICT(409)` incl. `ERR-DUP-INSTANCE`, `PRECONDITION_FAILED(412)`, `RATE_LIMITED(429)`, `INTERNAL(500)`; 503/423/502 dropped (X.3 mapping / async statuses) | §C row "error codes"; Foundation §1 |
| 8 | Envelope `{error:{code,message,field}, requestId}` | **`{error:{code,message,field,details}}`** + **`X-Correlation-Id` header** (no body `requestId`) | §C row "error envelope"; BRD §6.2; Foundation §1 |
| 9 | Pagination "`?page=&limit=` or cursor, max 100; `page/total`" | **Cursor only** (`?limit=` default 25 / max 100, `next_cursor`); offset paging removed | §C row "pagination"; Foundation §1 |
| 10 | Multi-tenancy omitted | **`tenant_id`/`entity_id` (NN)** added to **every** entity; data-layer scoping; unscoped query rejected | §C row "multi-tenancy"; Platform §0.1 |
| 11 | Invented role list (Appointing Authority, SR Custodian, Auditor, System Admin as bespoke principals; Grievance/Fraud as ad-hoc capabilities) | **RBAC v1.7** mapping (§3.0): new roles `Appointing Authority`/`SR Custodian` + capability flags `Grievance Officer`/`Fraud Reviewer` (RBAC §4.3); Auditor → Org-Admin read + entitlement; System Admin → Org/Platform Admin | §C row "role list"; `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6 |
| 12 | Step-up via bespoke `cr_step_up_events` only | **Invokes platform MFA / step-up (§3.1)**; `cr_step_up_events` records the platform challenge result | Platform §3.1; Vision §2.2 |
| 13 | Hand-rolled SLA scheduler (`SlaScheduler.tick`) | **P01 per-stage SLA runtime** (breach → escalation event → X.2 + P05) + **X.1** `JOB-PS02-SLA` reminder cadence | Platform §P01/§X.1 |
| 14 | Bespoke notification table + channels | **X.2** engine (IN_APP+EMAIL parallel; EMAIL mandatory/non-suppressible for approvals & statutory; backoff ×5 + DLQ) + **W.3** config; copy by `MSG-PS02-*` | §C; Platform §X.2; BRD §9.1/§9.9 |
| 15 | Inline/bespoke field validation + invented regex catalogue | **Cite `VAL-*`** (PAN/Aadhaar/IFSC/DOB/EFFECTIVE/EMAIL/MOBILE/FILE/COMMENT/ENUM/CONSENT/MASTER-UNIQUE/FLOW-NOCYCLE); author only **`VAL-PS02-*`** module-unique; register in Foundation §2 | Foundation §2; §7 of `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` |
| 16 | `M01 PATCH /employees/{id}:commit` live effective-dated write | **PS01/M01 effective-dated *staged* commit** (`effective_from`, applied by **`JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`**, not live); outbox/saga adjusted accordingly (§10.4) | Platform §3.3; Foundation §1 (effective-dating) |
| 17 | NFR `99.9% uptime`, `RPO ≤ 15 min` | **Platform NFR baseline:** `99.5%/month`, `RPO < 1 h`, `RTO < 4 h`, p95 < 500 ms, WCAG 2.1 AA | §C row "NFR"; Vision §2.9; BRD §7 |
| 18 | Migration undefined / ad-hoc | **P06** ETL+V (3 dry runs, waves, `migration_runs`, `<enterprise>_source_id` traceability) | §C row "migration"; Platform §P06 |
| 19 | Jobs implied/unregistered | **`JOB-PS02-*`** registered against the **X.1** runner + Foundation §4 index; reuses `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE` | Platform §X.1; Foundation §4 |
| 20 | Forms/flows implied as code | **W.1** process-flow + **W.2** form definitions (Org-Admin builders `cfg-approval-builder`/`cfg-form-builder`); configured, not coded | Platform §W.1/§W.2 |
| 21 | ADR-M02-01 "shared Change-Control engine to extract later" | **ADR-PS02-01:** PS02 is the **first enterprise consumer** of the existing platform sensitive-change pattern (P01 flow + catalog); PS05/PS06/PS09 future consumers — no new engine | `PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` §6.6; Platform §P01 caller list |
| 22 | "0 gaps / all Resolved" + 19 entities | **0 specification gaps + 7 honest build-time gates** retained; **18 module entities** (E18 audit-chain removed → P05); 7 platform-alignment reconciliation rows added (§14.6) | §C; Platform §P05 |

**Net re-grounding result:** 23 FRs and all v2 rigor preserved; **0 invented platform mechanisms remain** — workflow→P01, authz/SoD/PII→P02, audit→P05+OPEN-PLAT-03, notify→X.2/W.3, jobs→X.1, integrations→X.3, forms/flows→W.1/W.2, roles→RBAC v1.7, API/errors→Foundation §1, validation→`VAL-*`, SR→PS12, master→PS01/M01 effective-dated; multi-tenancy added to every table; module entities 19→18.

## Amendments (v3 → v3.1: cross-module remediation)

Surgical corrections from the R1–R5 integration reviews, applied per `docs/review/REMEDIATION.md` (D2 SR writer matrix, D5 shared-entity naming) to resolve the R3 finding that **identity-change SR events were claimed by both PS01 and PS02** (R3 F2) and the `JOB-PS01-EFFDATE` reference (R3 F11). **No FR is removed; all rigor, ACs, business rules, entities and traceability are preserved** — only the SR ownership model is corrected so a single module (PS01) owns identity/personal-data SR postings.

| # | v3.0 (as written) | v3.1 (corrected) | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | PS02 directly posts STATUTORY change events to the **PS12** SR ledger (FR-PS02-011 "posts an idempotent event … via X.3"; §1.1, §2.1) | **PS02 is NOT a Digital-SR source.** On COMMIT of an approved sensitive change, **PS01 (the employee-master/identity owner) posts** the identity/personal-data SR event to PS12 (`source_module=PS01`). PS02's responsibility ends at committing the change to the PS01 master via the effective-dated staged write; it supplies the SR context to PS01 and **tracks/reconciles** the resulting posting status. | REMEDIATION D2; R3 F2 |
| C2 | Boundary table (§2.3) "Statutory SR event posting … ✅ (writes event)"; §4.2/§9/§14.2/ownership tables show `PS02→PS12` SR append | Reworded to **`PS01→PS12`** (PS02 reads/tracks status); PS02 **never carries `source_module=PS02` SR payloads** and is removed as an SR writer in every boundary/integration/ownership table. | REMEDIATION D2; R3 F2 |
| C3 | FR-PS02-020 break-glass "posts a reversing PS12 SR event" | Reversal commits the reversing change to PS01, on which **PS01 posts the reversing SR event** (`source_module=PS01`); PS02 tracks status (FR-011). | REMEDIATION D2; R3 F2 |
| C4 | FR-PS02-011 titled "Statutory Change Posting to Digital Service Register (PS12)" with PS02 as poster | Re-titled **"Statutory Change Reflection in the Digital Service Register (PS01→PS12) & Posting-Status Reconciliation"**; description/ACs/BRs/LLD reframed to PS01-posts / PS02-tracks; internal `SrPostingService` → `SrReflectionTracker`. | REMEDIATION D2; R3 F2 |
| C5 | Analytics (§12) "Aggregates feed PS14" without SR-source scoping | Clarified: PS02 feeds PS14 **operational CR/workflow analytics only**; **SR-event analytics reach PS14 via PS12 (fed by PS01→PS12), not from PS02**. | REMEDIATION step 3; R3 F9 |
| C6 | Effective-dated staged commit job cited as **`JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`** (modelled on `JOB-M01-EFFDATE`) | **Retained/confirmed** — PS02 cites the PS01-owned/registered **`JOB-PS01-EFFDATE`** for the effective-dated staged commit; no `JOB-M01-EFFDATE`/unregistered variant is introduced as the active job. | REMEDIATION D5; R3 F11 |

*End of PS02-EPDM BRD v3.0 (platform-grounded). Architecture and rigor preserved from v2; re-anchored onto the existing PrimeSoft platform (P01–P06 / X.1–X.3 / W.1–W.3, RBAC v1.7, P05 audit, multi-tenancy, Foundation API/VAL/MSG/ERR/JOB catalogues). 23 FRs, 18 module entities, 0 specification gaps, 7 tracked build-time hard gates, 22 v2→v3 re-grounding amendments. EXTEND of PrimeSoft M01 sensitive-field-change.*
