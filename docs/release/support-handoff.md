# PH-11 Support Handoff

Marker: `SUPPORT_HANDOFF`

This handoff prepares steady-state support for HRMS after the release board authorizes go-live. It is readiness evidence only. It does not mean operations has accepted a live system, and it does not approve deployment. The current release state remains `GO_LIVE_HUMAN_APPROVAL_PENDING`.

- P3 requests start as helpdesk tickets and are reviewed daily during hypercare.
- Payroll, pension, SR, audit, and security issues must not be closed without module-owner confirmation.
