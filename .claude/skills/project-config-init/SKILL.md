# Project Config Init

Scaffold `project.config.yaml` at the repo root by auto-detecting everything possible, then asking targeted questions for what cannot be inferred.

## Schema note (shared file — merge, never overwrite)

Two section families share the single `project.config.yaml`:

- the **deploy schema** written by this skill and read by `deploy-app`/`local-deployment` (`services[]`, `gcloud.projects`, `app_groups`, ports, secrets), and
- the **pipeline-onboarding schema** written by `new-project-setup` (database policy, `ci_gates`, `commands`, metric thresholds).

The sections are additive — a repo may legitimately contain both families in the one file. If `project.config.yaml` already exists, read it and MERGE your sections into it; never overwrite or delete sections written by the other skill.

## Process

### Step 1: Auto-Detect Project Structure

```bash
# Project type
ls apps/ packages/ services/ 2>/dev/null && echo "monorepo" || echo "single-service"

# Deployable services (directories with a Dockerfile)
find . -name "Dockerfile*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.git/*" | sort

# Frameworks per service
for dir in $(find . -name "package.json" -maxdepth 3 -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | xargs -I{} dirname {}); do
  echo "$dir: $(cat $dir/package.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; p=json.load(sys.stdin); d={**p.get('dependencies',{}),**p.get('devDependencies',{})}; fw=[x for x in ['next','fastapi','express','vite','react'] if x in d]; print(','.join(fw) or 'unknown')" 2>/dev/null)"
done

# Python services
find . -name "pyproject.toml" -o -name "requirements.txt" -maxdepth 3 | grep -v node_modules

# Existing gcloud config
gcloud config get-value project 2>/dev/null
gcloud config get-value run/region 2>/dev/null

# Existing .env files for hints
find . -name ".env.example" -o -name ".env.sample" -maxdepth 3 | head -5

# Existing Cloud SQL proxy usage
rg "cloud-sql-proxy\|cloud_sql_proxy\|CLOUD_SQL" . --glob "*.{sh,md,yml,yaml,json}" -l 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Secret Manager usage
rg "secretmanager\|set-secrets\|SECRET" . --glob "*.{sh,yml,yaml}" -l 2>/dev/null | head -5

# nginx configs
find . -name "nginx*.conf" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | head -5

# Existing deploy scripts for hints
find . -name "deploy*.sh" -o -name "cloudbuild*.yaml" -maxdepth 3 | head -10
```

### Step 2: Build What You Know

From the auto-detection, fill in every field you can determine with confidence:
- Project type (monorepo / single-service)
- Service list with app_dir and type (api/ui) from Dockerfile naming patterns
- Framework per service from package.json
- GCP project ID from `gcloud config`
- Region from `gcloud config`
- nginx proxy services (those with nginx*.conf files)
- Local ports from existing `.env.example` or vite.config files

```bash
# Detect local ports from vite configs
rg "port:" --glob "vite.config.*" -n | head -10

# Detect API port from source
rg "listen\(|PORT" --glob "*.{ts,js,py}" --glob "!*.test.*" -n | head -10

# Detect Cloud SQL instance from existing scripts/configs
# (substitute <region> and <instance-name> hints if you already know them)
rg "cloud-sql|cloudsql|<region>|<instance-name>" . --glob "*.{sh,yaml,yml,json,md}" -n | head -20

# Detect secret names from existing deploy scripts
rg "set-secrets\|--set-secrets" . --glob "*.{sh,yaml}" -n | head -20

# Detect compute service account number
gcloud projects describe $(gcloud config get-value project 2>/dev/null) --format="value(projectNumber)" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Ask Only What Cannot Be Inferred

Present what was detected and ask only the gaps. Keep it to one focused block:

```
I've detected the following for [project-name]:

Services found:
  ✓ apps/api     → API (Express/FastAPI/etc.), Dockerfile: [name]
  ✓ apps/web     → UI (Vite+React), Dockerfile: [name]
  ✓ GCP project: [detected or unknown]
  ✓ Region:      [detected or unknown]

I need a few values I couldn't detect automatically:

1. Cloud SQL instance connection string (format: project:region:instance-name)
   [or "none" if not using Cloud SQL]

2. Artifact Registry base path (format: region-docker.pkg.dev/project/repo-name)
   [or "gcr.io/project" for Container Registry]

3. For each service, the Secret Manager secret names for DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET:
   apps/api DATABASE_URL secret name: [e.g. myapp-database-url]
   apps/api JWT_SECRET secret name: [e.g. myapp-jwt-secret]

4. Local proxy port for Cloud SQL (default: 15432, or 15435 if that's your convention)

5. Test credentials from seed data:
   Admin username and password: [e.g. admin / password]
```

Ask in one message — not one question at a time.

### Step 4: Generate project.config.yaml

Using the detected values + user answers, write a complete, populated `project.config.yaml`. Do not use placeholders — every field should have a real value or be explicitly set to `null`.

```bash
# After writing, verify it's valid YAML
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('project.config.yaml')); print('✓ Valid YAML')"
```

### Step 5: Report

Tell the user:
- What was auto-detected vs. what was provided manually
- What to verify before first use (especially Secret Manager secret names and Cloud SQL connection string)
- That this file should be committed to the repo: `git add project.config.yaml && git commit -m "chore: add deployment config"`
- That sensitive values (passwords, keys) must NOT go in this file — they belong in Secret Manager

## Output

`project.config.yaml` at the repo root.

## Notes

- `project.config.yaml` is safe to commit — it contains service names and structure, not secrets
- Secrets live in Secret Manager; `project.config.yaml` only stores the *names* of those secrets
- Run this once per project; update the file manually when adding new services
